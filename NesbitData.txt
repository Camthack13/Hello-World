Chapter I. The beginning of things.


They were not railway children to begin with. I don't suppose they had
ever thought about railways except as a means of getting to Maskelyne
and Cook's, the Pantomime, Zoological Gardens, and Madame Tussaud's.
They were just ordinary suburban children, and they lived with their
Father and Mother in an ordinary red-brick-fronted villa, with coloured
glass in the front door, a tiled passage that was called a hall, a
bath-room with hot and cold water, electric bells, French windows, and
a good deal of white paint, and 'every modern convenience', as the
house-agents say.

There were three of them. Roberta was the eldest. Of course, Mothers
never have favourites, but if their Mother HAD had a favourite, it might
have been Roberta. Next came Peter, who wished to be an Engineer when he
grew up; and the youngest was Phyllis, who meant extremely well.

Mother did not spend all her time in paying dull calls to dull ladies,
and sitting dully at home waiting for dull ladies to pay calls to her.
She was almost always there, ready to play with the children, and read
to them, and help them to do their home-lessons. Besides this she used
to write stories for them while they were at school, and read them
aloud after tea, and she always made up funny pieces of poetry for their
birthdays and for other great occasions, such as the christening of the
new kittens, or the refurnishing of the doll's house, or the time when
they were getting over the mumps.

These three lucky children always had everything they needed: pretty
clothes, good fires, a lovely nursery with heaps of toys, and a Mother
Goose wall-paper. They had a kind and merry nursemaid, and a dog who was
called James, and who was their very own. They also had a Father who was
just perfect--never cross, never unjust, and always ready for a game--at
least, if at any time he was NOT ready, he always had an excellent
reason for it, and explained the reason to the children so interestingly
and funnily that they felt sure he couldn't help himself.

You will think that they ought to have been very happy. And so they
were, but they did not know HOW happy till the pretty life in the Red
Villa was over and done with, and they had to live a very different life
indeed.

The dreadful change came quite suddenly.

Peter had a birthday--his tenth. Among his other presents was a model
engine more perfect than you could ever have dreamed of. The other
presents were full of charm, but the Engine was fuller of charm than any
of the others were.

Its charm lasted in its full perfection for exactly three days. Then,
owing either to Peter's inexperience or Phyllis's good intentions, which
had been rather pressing, or to some other cause, the Engine suddenly
went off with a bang. James was so frightened that he went out and did
not come back all day. All the Noah's Ark people who were in the tender
were broken to bits, but nothing else was hurt except the poor little
engine and the feelings of Peter. The others said he cried over it--but
of course boys of ten do not cry, however terrible the tragedies may be
which darken their lot. He said that his eyes were red because he had a
cold. This turned out to be true, though Peter did not know it was when
he said it, the next day he had to go to bed and stay there. Mother
began to be afraid that he might be sickening for measles, when suddenly
he sat up in bed and said:

“I hate gruel--I hate barley water--I hate bread and milk. I want to get
up and have something REAL to eat.”

“What would you like?” Mother asked.

“A pigeon-pie,” said Peter, eagerly, “a large pigeon-pie. A very large
one.”

So Mother asked the Cook to make a large pigeon-pie. The pie was made.
And when the pie was made, it was cooked. And when it was cooked, Peter
ate some of it. After that his cold was better. Mother made a piece of
poetry to amuse him while the pie was being made. It began by saying
what an unfortunate but worthy boy Peter was, then it went on:

      He had an engine that he loved
        With all his heart and soul,
      And if he had a wish on earth
        It was to keep it whole.

      One day--my friends, prepare your minds;
        I'm coming to the worst--
      Quite suddenly a screw went mad,
        And then the boiler burst!

      With gloomy face he picked it up
        And took it to his Mother,
      Though even he could not suppose
        That she could make another;

      For those who perished on the line
        He did not seem to care,
      His engine being more to him
        Than all the people there.

      And now you see the reason why
        Our Peter has been ill:
      He soothes his soul with pigeon-pie
        His gnawing grief to kill.

      He wraps himself in blankets warm
        And sleeps in bed till late,
      Determined thus to overcome
        His miserable fate.

      And if his eyes are rather red,
        His cold must just excuse it:
      Offer him pie; you may be sure
        He never will refuse it.

Father had been away in the country for three or four days. All Peter's
hopes for the curing of his afflicted Engine were now fixed on his
Father, for Father was most wonderfully clever with his fingers. He
could mend all sorts of things. He had often acted as veterinary surgeon
to the wooden rocking-horse; once he had saved its life when all human
aid was despaired of, and the poor creature was given up for lost, and
even the carpenter said he didn't see his way to do anything. And it was
Father who mended the doll's cradle when no one else could; and with a
little glue and some bits of wood and a pen-knife made all the Noah's
Ark beasts as strong on their pins as ever they were, if not stronger.

Peter, with heroic unselfishness, did not say anything about his Engine
till after Father had had his dinner and his after-dinner cigar. The
unselfishness was Mother's idea--but it was Peter who carried it out.
And needed a good deal of patience, too.

At last Mother said to Father, “Now, dear, if you're quite rested, and
quite comfy, we want to tell you about the great railway accident, and
ask your advice.”

“All right,” said Father, “fire away!”

So then Peter told the sad tale, and fetched what was left of the
Engine.

“Hum,” said Father, when he had looked the Engine over very carefully.

The children held their breaths.

“Is there NO hope?” said Peter, in a low, unsteady voice.

“Hope? Rather! Tons of it,” said Father, cheerfully; “but it'll want
something besides hope--a bit of brazing say, or some solder, and a new
valve. I think we'd better keep it for a rainy day. In other words, I'll
give up Saturday afternoon to it, and you shall all help me.”

“CAN girls help to mend engines?” Peter asked doubtfully.

“Of course they can. Girls are just as clever as boys, and don't you
forget it! How would you like to be an engine-driver, Phil?”

“My face would be always dirty, wouldn't it?” said Phyllis, in
unenthusiastic tones, “and I expect I should break something.”

“I should just love it,” said Roberta--“do you think I could when I'm
grown up, Daddy? Or even a stoker?”

“You mean a fireman,” said Daddy, pulling and twisting at the engine.
“Well, if you still wish it, when you're grown up, we'll see about
making you a fire-woman. I remember when I was a boy--”

Just then there was a knock at the front door.

“Who on earth!” said Father. “An Englishman's house is his castle, of
course, but I do wish they built semi-detached villas with moats and
drawbridges.”

Ruth--she was the parlour-maid and had red hair--came in and said that
two gentlemen wanted to see the master.

“I've shown them into the Library, Sir,” said she.

“I expect it's the subscription to the Vicar's testimonial,” said
Mother, “or else it's the choir holiday fund. Get rid of them quickly,
dear. It does break up an evening so, and it's nearly the children's
bedtime.”

But Father did not seem to be able to get rid of the gentlemen at all
quickly.

“I wish we HAD got a moat and drawbridge,” said Roberta; “then, when we
didn't want people, we could just pull up the drawbridge and no one else
could get in. I expect Father will have forgotten about when he was a
boy if they stay much longer.”

Mother tried to make the time pass by telling them a new fairy story
about a Princess with green eyes, but it was difficult because they
could hear the voices of Father and the gentlemen in the Library, and
Father's voice sounded louder and different to the voice he generally
used to people who came about testimonials and holiday funds.

Then the Library bell rang, and everyone heaved a breath of relief.

“They're going now,” said Phyllis; “he's rung to have them shown out.”

But instead of showing anybody out, Ruth showed herself in, and she
looked queer, the children thought.

“Please'm,” she said, “the Master wants you to just step into the study.
He looks like the dead, mum; I think he's had bad news. You'd best
prepare yourself for the worst, 'm--p'raps it's a death in the family or
a bank busted or--”

“That'll do, Ruth,” said Mother gently; “you can go.”

Then Mother went into the Library. There was more talking. Then the bell
rang again, and Ruth fetched a cab. The children heard boots go out and
down the steps. The cab drove away, and the front door shut. Then Mother
came in. Her dear face was as white as her lace collar, and her eyes
looked very big and shining. Her mouth looked like just a line of pale
red--her lips were thin and not their proper shape at all.

“It's bedtime,” she said. “Ruth will put you to bed.”

“But you promised we should sit up late tonight because Father's come
home,” said Phyllis.

“Father's been called away--on business,” said Mother. “Come, darlings,
go at once.”

They kissed her and went. Roberta lingered to give Mother an extra hug
and to whisper:

“It wasn't bad news, Mammy, was it? Is anyone dead--or--”

“Nobody's dead--no,” said Mother, and she almost seemed to push Roberta
away. “I can't tell you anything tonight, my pet. Go, dear, go NOW.”

So Roberta went.

Ruth brushed the girls' hair and helped them to undress. (Mother almost
always did this herself.) When she had turned down the gas and left them
she found Peter, still dressed, waiting on the stairs.

“I say, Ruth, what's up?” he asked.

“Don't ask me no questions and I won't tell you no lies,” the red-headed
Ruth replied. “You'll know soon enough.”

Late that night Mother came up and kissed all three children as they
lay asleep. But Roberta was the only one whom the kiss woke, and she lay
mousey-still, and said nothing.

“If Mother doesn't want us to know she's been crying,” she said to
herself as she heard through the dark the catching of her Mother's
breath, “we WON'T know it. That's all.”

When they came down to breakfast the next morning, Mother had already
gone out.

“To London,” Ruth said, and left them to their breakfast.

“There's something awful the matter,” said Peter, breaking his egg.
“Ruth told me last night we should know soon enough.”

“Did you ASK her?” said Roberta, with scorn.

“Yes, I did!” said Peter, angrily. “If you could go to bed without
caring whether Mother was worried or not, I couldn't. So there.”

“I don't think we ought to ask the servants things Mother doesn't tell
us,” said Roberta.

“That's right, Miss Goody-goody,” said Peter, “preach away.”

“I'M not goody,” said Phyllis, “but I think Bobbie's right this time.”

“Of course. She always is. In her own opinion,” said Peter.

“Oh, DON'T!” cried Roberta, putting down her egg-spoon; “don't let's be
horrid to each other. I'm sure some dire calamity is happening. Don't
let's make it worse!”

“Who began, I should like to know?” said Peter.

Roberta made an effort, and answered:--

“I did, I suppose, but--”

“Well, then,” said Peter, triumphantly. But before he went to school he
thumped his sister between the shoulders and told her to cheer up.

The children came home to one o'clock dinner, but Mother was not there.
And she was not there at tea-time.

It was nearly seven before she came in, looking so ill and tired that
the children felt they could not ask her any questions. She sank into an
arm-chair. Phyllis took the long pins out of her hat, while Roberta took
off her gloves, and Peter unfastened her walking-shoes and fetched her
soft velvety slippers for her.

When she had had a cup of tea, and Roberta had put eau-de-Cologne on her
poor head that ached, Mother said:--

“Now, my darlings, I want to tell you something. Those men last night
did bring very bad news, and Father will be away for some time. I am
very worried about it, and I want you all to help me, and not to make
things harder for me.”

“As if we would!” said Roberta, holding Mother's hand against her face.

“You can help me very much,” said Mother, “by being good and happy
and not quarrelling when I'm away”--Roberta and Peter exchanged guilty
glances--“for I shall have to be away a good deal.”

“We won't quarrel. Indeed we won't,” said everybody. And meant it, too.

“Then,” Mother went on, “I want you not to ask me any questions about
this trouble; and not to ask anybody else any questions.”

Peter cringed and shuffled his boots on the carpet.

“You'll promise this, too, won't you?” said Mother.

“I did ask Ruth,” said Peter, suddenly. “I'm very sorry, but I did.”

“And what did she say?”

“She said I should know soon enough.”

“It isn't necessary for you to know anything about it,” said Mother;
“it's about business, and you never do understand business, do you?”

“No,” said Roberta; “is it something to do with Government?” For Father
was in a Government Office.

“Yes,” said Mother. “Now it's bed-time, my darlings. And don't YOU
worry. It'll all come right in the end.”

“Then don't YOU worry either, Mother,” said Phyllis, “and we'll all be
as good as gold.”

Mother sighed and kissed them.

“We'll begin being good the first thing tomorrow morning,” said Peter,
as they went upstairs.

“Why not NOW?” said Roberta.

“There's nothing to be good ABOUT now, silly,” said Peter.

“We might begin to try to FEEL good,” said Phyllis, “and not call
names.”

“Who's calling names?” said Peter. “Bobbie knows right enough that when
I say 'silly', it's just the same as if I said Bobbie.”

“WELL,” said Roberta.

“No, I don't mean what you mean. I mean it's just a--what is it Father
calls it?--a germ of endearment! Good night.”

The girls folded up their clothes with more than usual neatness--which
was the only way of being good that they could think of.

“I say,” said Phyllis, smoothing out her pinafore, “you used to say
it was so dull--nothing happening, like in books. Now something HAS
happened.”

“I never wanted things to happen to make Mother unhappy,” said Roberta.
“Everything's perfectly horrid.”

Everything continued to be perfectly horrid for some weeks.

Mother was nearly always out. Meals were dull and dirty. The
between-maid was sent away, and Aunt Emma came on a visit. Aunt Emma was
much older than Mother. She was going abroad to be a governess. She
was very busy getting her clothes ready, and they were very ugly, dingy
clothes, and she had them always littering about, and the sewing-machine
seemed to whir--on and on all day and most of the night. Aunt Emma
believed in keeping children in their proper places. And they more than
returned the compliment. Their idea of Aunt Emma's proper place was
anywhere where they were not. So they saw very little of her. They
preferred the company of the servants, who were more amusing. Cook,
if in a good temper, could sing comic songs, and the housemaid, if she
happened not to be offended with you, could imitate a hen that has laid
an egg, a bottle of champagne being opened, and could mew like two cats
fighting. The servants never told the children what the bad news was
that the gentlemen had brought to Father. But they kept hinting
that they could tell a great deal if they chose--and this was not
comfortable.

One day when Peter had made a booby trap over the bath-room door, and
it had acted beautifully as Ruth passed through, that red-haired
parlour-maid caught him and boxed his ears.

“You'll come to a bad end,” she said furiously, “you nasty little limb,
you! If you don't mend your ways, you'll go where your precious Father's
gone, so I tell you straight!”

Roberta repeated this to her Mother, and next day Ruth was sent away.

Then came the time when Mother came home and went to bed and stayed
there two days and the Doctor came, and the children crept wretchedly
about the house and wondered if the world was coming to an end.

Mother came down one morning to breakfast, very pale and with lines
on her face that used not to be there. And she smiled, as well as she
could, and said:--

“Now, my pets, everything is settled. We're going to leave this house,
and go and live in the country. Such a ducky dear little white house. I
know you'll love it.”

A whirling week of packing followed--not just packing clothes, like when
you go to the seaside, but packing chairs and tables, covering their
tops with sacking and their legs with straw.

All sorts of things were packed that you don't pack when you go to
the seaside. Crockery, blankets, candlesticks, carpets, bedsteads,
saucepans, and even fenders and fire-irons.

The house was like a furniture warehouse. I think the children enjoyed
it very much. Mother was very busy, but not too busy now to talk to
them, and read to them, and even to make a bit of poetry for Phyllis to
cheer her up when she fell down with a screwdriver and ran it into her
hand.

“Aren't you going to pack this, Mother?” Roberta asked, pointing to the
beautiful cabinet inlaid with red turtleshell and brass.

“We can't take everything,” said Mother.

“But we seem to be taking all the ugly things,” said Roberta.

“We're taking the useful ones,” said Mother; “we've got to play at being
Poor for a bit, my chickabiddy.”

When all the ugly useful things had been packed up and taken away in a
van by men in green-baize aprons, the two girls and Mother and Aunt Emma
slept in the two spare rooms where the furniture was all pretty. All
their beds had gone. A bed was made up for Peter on the drawing-room
sofa.

“I say, this is larks,” he said, wriggling joyously, as Mother tucked
him up. “I do like moving! I wish we moved once a month.”

Mother laughed.

“I don't!” she said. “Good night, Peterkin.”

As she turned away Roberta saw her face. She never forgot it.

“Oh, Mother,” she whispered all to herself as she got into bed, “how
brave you are! How I love you! Fancy being brave enough to laugh when
you're feeling like THAT!”

Next day boxes were filled, and boxes and more boxes; and then late in
the afternoon a cab came to take them to the station.

Aunt Emma saw them off. They felt that THEY were seeing HER off, and
they were glad of it.

“But, oh, those poor little foreign children that she's going to
governess!” whispered Phyllis. “I wouldn't be them for anything!”

At first they enjoyed looking out of the window, but when it grew dusk
they grew sleepier and sleepier, and no one knew how long they had been
in the train when they were roused by Mother's shaking them gently and
saying:--

“Wake up, dears. We're there.”

They woke up, cold and melancholy, and stood shivering on the draughty
platform while the baggage was taken out of the train. Then the engine,
puffing and blowing, set to work again, and dragged the train away. The
children watched the tail-lights of the guard's van disappear into the
darkness.

This was the first train the children saw on that railway which was in
time to become so very dear to them. They did not guess then how they
would grow to love the railway, and how soon it would become the centre
of their new life, nor what wonders and changes it would bring to them.
They only shivered and sneezed and hoped the walk to the new house would
not be long. Peter's nose was colder than he ever remembered it to have
been before. Roberta's hat was crooked, and the elastic seemed tighter
than usual. Phyllis's shoe-laces had come undone.

“Come,” said Mother, “we've got to walk. There aren't any cabs here.”

The walk was dark and muddy. The children stumbled a little on the rough
road, and once Phyllis absently fell into a puddle, and was picked up
damp and unhappy. There were no gas-lamps on the road, and the road was
uphill. The cart went at a foot's pace, and they followed the gritty
crunch of its wheels. As their eyes got used to the darkness, they could
see the mound of boxes swaying dimly in front of them.

A long gate had to be opened for the cart to pass through, and after
that the road seemed to go across fields--and now it went down hill.
Presently a great dark lumpish thing showed over to the right.

“There's the house,” said Mother. “I wonder why she's shut the
shutters.”

“Who's SHE?” asked Roberta.

“The woman I engaged to clean the place, and put the furniture straight
and get supper.”

There was a low wall, and trees inside.

“That's the garden,” said Mother.

“It looks more like a dripping-pan full of black cabbages,” said Peter.

The cart went on along by the garden wall, and round to the back of the
house, and here it clattered into a cobble-stoned yard and stopped at
the back door.

There was no light in any of the windows.

Everyone hammered at the door, but no one came.

The man who drove the cart said he expected Mrs. Viney had gone home.

“You see your train was that late,” said he.

“But she's got the key,” said Mother. “What are we to do?”

“Oh, she'll have left that under the doorstep,” said the cart man;
“folks do hereabouts.” He took the lantern off his cart and stooped.

“Ay, here it is, right enough,” he said.

He unlocked the door and went in and set his lantern on the table.

“Got e'er a candle?” said he.

“I don't know where anything is.” Mother spoke rather less cheerfully
than usual.

He struck a match. There was a candle on the table, and he lighted it.
By its thin little glimmer the children saw a large bare kitchen with
a stone floor. There were no curtains, no hearth-rug. The kitchen
table from home stood in the middle of the room. The chairs were in one
corner, and the pots, pans, brooms, and crockery in another. There was
no fire, and the black grate showed cold, dead ashes.

As the cart man turned to go out after he had brought in the boxes,
there was a rustling, scampering sound that seemed to come from inside
the walls of the house.

“Oh, what's that?” cried the girls.

“It's only the rats,” said the cart man. And he went away and shut the
door, and the sudden draught of it blew out the candle.

“Oh, dear,” said Phyllis, “I wish we hadn't come!” and she knocked a
chair over.

“ONLY the rats!” said Peter, in the dark.



Chapter II. Peter's coal-mine.


“What fun!” said Mother, in the dark, feeling for the matches on the
table. “How frightened the poor mice were--I don't believe they were
rats at all.”

She struck a match and relighted the candle and everyone looked at each
other by its winky, blinky light.

“Well,” she said, “you've often wanted something to happen and now it
has. This is quite an adventure, isn't it? I told Mrs. Viney to get us
some bread and butter, and meat and things, and to have supper ready. I
suppose she's laid it in the dining-room. So let's go and see.”

The dining-room opened out of the kitchen. It looked much darker than
the kitchen when they went in with the one candle. Because the kitchen
was whitewashed, but the dining-room was dark wood from floor to
ceiling, and across the ceiling there were heavy black beams. There was
a muddled maze of dusty furniture--the breakfast-room furniture from
the old home where they had lived all their lives. It seemed a very long
time ago, and a very long way off.

There was the table certainly, and there were chairs, but there was no
supper.

“Let's look in the other rooms,” said Mother; and they looked. And in
each room was the same kind of blundering half-arrangement of furniture,
and fire-irons and crockery, and all sorts of odd things on the floor,
but there was nothing to eat; even in the pantry there were only a rusty
cake-tin and a broken plate with whitening mixed in it.

“What a horrid old woman!” said Mother; “she's just walked off with the
money and not got us anything to eat at all.”

“Then shan't we have any supper at all?” asked Phyllis, dismayed,
stepping back on to a soap-dish that cracked responsively.

“Oh, yes,” said Mother, “only it'll mean unpacking one of those big
cases that we put in the cellar. Phil, do mind where you're walking to,
there's a dear. Peter, hold the light.”

The cellar door opened out of the kitchen. There were five wooden steps
leading down. It wasn't a proper cellar at all, the children thought,
because its ceiling went up as high as the kitchen's. A bacon-rack hung
under its ceiling. There was wood in it, and coal. Also the big cases.

Peter held the candle, all on one side, while Mother tried to open the
great packing-case. It was very securely nailed down.

“Where's the hammer?” asked Peter.

“That's just it,” said Mother. “I'm afraid it's inside the box. But
there's a coal-shovel--and there's the kitchen poker.”

And with these she tried to get the case open.

“Let me do it,” said Peter, thinking he could do it better himself.
Everyone thinks this when he sees another person stirring a fire, or
opening a box, or untying a knot in a bit of string.

“You'll hurt your hands, Mammy,” said Roberta; “let me.”

“I wish Father was here,” said Phyllis; “he'd get it open in two shakes.
What are you kicking me for, Bobbie?”

“I wasn't,” said Roberta.

Just then the first of the long nails in the packing-case began to come
out with a scrunch. Then a lath was raised and then another, till all
four stood up with the long nails in them shining fiercely like iron
teeth in the candle-light.

“Hooray!” said Mother; “here are some candles--the very first thing! You
girls go and light them. You'll find some saucers and things. Just drop
a little candle-grease in the saucer and stick the candle upright in
it.”

“How many shall we light?”

“As many as ever you like,” said Mother, gaily. “The great thing is
to be cheerful. Nobody can be cheerful in the dark except owls and
dormice.”

So the girls lighted candles. The head of the first match flew off and
stuck to Phyllis's finger; but, as Roberta said, it was only a little
burn, and she might have had to be a Roman martyr and be burned whole if
she had happened to live in the days when those things were fashionable.

Then, when the dining-room was lighted by fourteen candles, Roberta
fetched coal and wood and lighted a fire.

“It's very cold for May,” she said, feeling what a grown-up thing it was
to say.

The fire-light and the candle-light made the dining-room look very
different, for now you could see that the dark walls were of wood,
carved here and there into little wreaths and loops.

The girls hastily 'tidied' the room, which meant putting the chairs
against the wall, and piling all the odds and ends into a corner and
partly hiding them with the big leather arm-chair that Father used to
sit in after dinner.

“Bravo!” cried Mother, coming in with a tray full of things. “This is
something like! I'll just get a tablecloth and then--”

The tablecloth was in a box with a proper lock that was opened with a
key and not with a shovel, and when the cloth was spread on the table, a
real feast was laid out on it.

Everyone was very, very tired, but everyone cheered up at the sight of
the funny and delightful supper. There were biscuits, the Marie and the
plain kind, sardines, preserved ginger, cooking raisins, and candied
peel and marmalade.

“What a good thing Aunt Emma packed up all the odds and ends out of the
Store cupboard,” said Mother. “Now, Phil, DON'T put the marmalade spoon
in among the sardines.”

“No, I won't, Mother,” said Phyllis, and put it down among the Marie
biscuits.

“Let's drink Aunt Emma's health,” said Roberta, suddenly; “what should
we have done if she hadn't packed up these things? Here's to Aunt Emma!”

And the toast was drunk in ginger wine and water, out of
willow-patterned tea-cups, because the glasses couldn't be found.

They all felt that they had been a little hard on Aunt Emma. She wasn't
a nice cuddly person like Mother, but after all it was she who had
thought of packing up the odds and ends of things to eat.

It was Aunt Emma, too, who had aired all the sheets ready; and the men
who had moved the furniture had put the bedsteads together, so the beds
were soon made.

“Good night, chickies,” said Mother. “I'm sure there aren't any rats.
But I'll leave my door open, and then if a mouse comes, you need only
scream, and I'll come and tell it exactly what I think of it.”

Then she went to her own room. Roberta woke to hear the little
travelling clock chime two. It sounded like a church clock ever so far
away, she always thought. And she heard, too, Mother still moving about
in her room.

Next morning Roberta woke Phyllis by pulling her hair gently, but quite
enough for her purpose.

“Wassermarrer?” asked Phyllis, still almost wholly asleep.

“Wake up! wake up!” said Roberta. “We're in the new house--don't you
remember? No servants or anything. Let's get up and begin to be useful.
We'll just creep down mouse-quietly, and have everything beautiful
before Mother gets up. I've woke Peter. He'll be dressed as soon as we
are.”

So they dressed quietly and quickly. Of course, there was no water in
their room, so when they got down they washed as much as they thought
was necessary under the spout of the pump in the yard. One pumped and
the other washed. It was splashy but interesting.

“It's much more fun than basin washing,” said Roberta. “How sparkly
the weeds are between the stones, and the moss on the roof--oh, and the
flowers!”

The roof of the back kitchen sloped down quite low. It was made
of thatch and it had moss on it, and house-leeks and stonecrop and
wallflowers, and even a clump of purple flag-flowers, at the far corner.

“This is far, far, far and away prettier than Edgecombe Villa,” said
Phyllis. “I wonder what the garden's like.”

“We mustn't think of the garden yet,” said Roberta, with earnest energy.
“Let's go in and begin to work.”

They lighted the fire and put the kettle on, and they arranged the
crockery for breakfast; they could not find all the right things, but
a glass ash-tray made an excellent salt-cellar, and a newish baking-tin
seemed as if it would do to put bread on, if they had any.

When there seemed to be nothing more that they could do, they went out
again into the fresh bright morning.

“We'll go into the garden now,” said Peter. But somehow they couldn't
find the garden. They went round the house and round the house. The yard
occupied the back, and across it were stables and outbuildings. On the
other three sides the house stood simply in a field, without a yard
of garden to divide it from the short smooth turf. And yet they had
certainly seen the garden wall the night before.

It was a hilly country. Down below they could see the line of the
railway, and the black yawning mouth of a tunnel. The station was out of
sight. There was a great bridge with tall arches running across one end
of the valley.

“Never mind the garden,” said Peter; “let's go down and look at the
railway. There might be trains passing.”

“We can see them from here,” said Roberta, slowly; “let's sit down a
bit.”

So they all sat down on a great flat grey stone that had pushed itself
up out of the grass; it was one of many that lay about on the hillside,
and when Mother came out to look for them at eight o'clock, she found
them deeply asleep in a contented, sun-warmed bunch.

They had made an excellent fire, and had set the kettle on it at about
half-past five. So that by eight the fire had been out for some time,
the water had all boiled away, and the bottom was burned out of the
kettle. Also they had not thought of washing the crockery before they
set the table.

“But it doesn't matter--the cups and saucers, I mean,” said Mother.
“Because I've found another room--I'd quite forgotten there was one. And
it's magic! And I've boiled the water for tea in a saucepan.”

The forgotten room opened out of the kitchen. In the agitation and half
darkness the night before its door had been mistaken for a cupboard's.
It was a little square room, and on its table, all nicely set out, was a
joint of cold roast beef, with bread, butter, cheese, and a pie.

“Pie for breakfast!” cried Peter; “how perfectly ripping!”

“It isn't pigeon-pie,” said Mother; “it's only apple. Well, this is the
supper we ought to have had last night. And there was a note from Mrs.
Viney. Her son-in-law has broken his arm, and she had to get home early.
She's coming this morning at ten.”

That was a wonderful breakfast. It is unusual to begin the day with
cold apple pie, but the children all said they would rather have it than
meat.

“You see it's more like dinner than breakfast to us,” said Peter,
passing his plate for more, “because we were up so early.”

The day passed in helping Mother to unpack and arrange things. Six small
legs quite ached with running about while their owners carried clothes
and crockery and all sorts of things to their proper places. It was not
till quite late in the afternoon that Mother said:--

“There! That'll do for to-day. I'll lie down for an hour, so as to be as
fresh as a lark by supper-time.”

Then they all looked at each other. Each of the three expressive
countenances expressed the same thought. That thought was double,
and consisted, like the bits of information in the Child's Guide to
Knowledge, of a question and an answer.

Q. Where shall we go?

A. To the railway.

So to the railway they went, and as soon as they started for the railway
they saw where the garden had hidden itself. It was right behind the
stables, and it had a high wall all round.

“Oh, never mind about the garden now!” cried Peter. “Mother told me
this morning where it was. It'll keep till to-morrow. Let's get to the
railway.”

The way to the railway was all down hill over smooth, short turf with
here and there furze bushes and grey and yellow rocks sticking out like
candied peel from the top of a cake.

The way ended in a steep run and a wooden fence--and there was the
railway with the shining metals and the telegraph wires and posts and
signals.

They all climbed on to the top of the fence, and then suddenly there was
a rumbling sound that made them look along the line to the right, where
the dark mouth of a tunnel opened itself in the face of a rocky cliff;
next moment a train had rushed out of the tunnel with a shriek and
a snort, and had slid noisily past them. They felt the rush of its
passing, and the pebbles on the line jumped and rattled under it as it
went by.

“Oh!” said Roberta, drawing a long breath; “it was like a great dragon
tearing by. Did you feel it fan us with its hot wings?”

“I suppose a dragon's lair might look very like that tunnel from the
outside,” said Phyllis.

But Peter said:--

“I never thought we should ever get as near to a train as this. It's the
most ripping sport!”

“Better than toy-engines, isn't it?” said Roberta.

(I am tired of calling Roberta by her name. I don't see why I should.
No one else did. Everyone else called her Bobbie, and I don't see why I
shouldn't.)

“I don't know; it's different,” said Peter. “It seems so odd to see ALL
of a train. It's awfully tall, isn't it?”

“We've always seen them cut in half by platforms,” said Phyllis.

“I wonder if that train was going to London,” Bobbie said. “London's
where Father is.”

“Let's go down to the station and find out,” said Peter.

So they went.

They walked along the edge of the line, and heard the telegraph wires
humming over their heads. When you are in the train, it seems such a
little way between post and post, and one after another the posts seem
to catch up the wires almost more quickly than you can count them. But
when you have to walk, the posts seem few and far between.

But the children got to the station at last.

Never before had any of them been at a station, except for the purpose
of catching trains--or perhaps waiting for them--and always with
grown-ups in attendance, grown-ups who were not themselves interested in
stations, except as places from which they wished to get away.

Never before had they passed close enough to a signal-box to be able to
notice the wires, and to hear the mysterious 'ping, ping,' followed by
the strong, firm clicking of machinery.

The very sleepers on which the rails lay were a delightful path to
travel by--just far enough apart to serve as the stepping-stones in a
game of foaming torrents hastily organised by Bobbie.

Then to arrive at the station, not through the booking office, but in
a freebooting sort of way by the sloping end of the platform. This in
itself was joy.

Joy, too, it was to peep into the porters' room, where the lamps are,
and the Railway almanac on the wall, and one porter half asleep behind a
paper.

There were a great many crossing lines at the station; some of them just
ran into a yard and stopped short, as though they were tired of business
and meant to retire for good. Trucks stood on the rails here, and on one
side was a great heap of coal--not a loose heap, such as you see in your
coal cellar, but a sort of solid building of coals with large square
blocks of coal outside used just as though they were bricks, and built
up till the heap looked like the picture of the Cities of the Plain in
'Bible Stories for Infants.' There was a line of whitewash near the top
of the coaly wall.

When presently the Porter lounged out of his room at the twice-repeated
tingling thrill of a gong over the station door, Peter said, “How do you
do?” in his best manner, and hastened to ask what the white mark was on
the coal for.

“To mark how much coal there be,” said the Porter, “so as we'll know if
anyone nicks it. So don't you go off with none in your pockets, young
gentleman!”

This seemed, at the time but a merry jest, and Peter felt at once that
the Porter was a friendly sort with no nonsense about him. But later the
words came back to Peter with a new meaning.

Have you ever gone into a farmhouse kitchen on a baking day, and seen
the great crock of dough set by the fire to rise? If you have, and if
you were at that time still young enough to be interested in everything
you saw, you will remember that you found yourself quite unable to
resist the temptation to poke your finger into the soft round of dough
that curved inside the pan like a giant mushroom. And you will remember
that your finger made a dent in the dough, and that slowly, but quite
surely, the dent disappeared, and the dough looked quite the same as it
did before you touched it. Unless, of course, your hand was extra dirty,
in which case, naturally, there would be a little black mark.

Well, it was just like that with the sorrow the children had felt at
Father's going away, and at Mother's being so unhappy. It made a deep
impression, but the impression did not last long.

They soon got used to being without Father, though they did not forget
him; and they got used to not going to school, and to seeing very little
of Mother, who was now almost all day shut up in her upstairs room
writing, writing, writing. She used to come down at tea-time and read
aloud the stories she had written. They were lovely stories.

The rocks and hills and valleys and trees, the canal, and above all, the
railway, were so new and so perfectly pleasing that the remembrance of
the old life in the villa grew to seem almost like a dream.

Mother had told them more than once that they were 'quite poor now,' but
this did not seem to be anything but a way of speaking. Grown-up people,
even Mothers, often make remarks that don't seem to mean anything in
particular, just for the sake of saying something, seemingly. There was
always enough to eat, and they wore the same kind of nice clothes they
had always worn.

But in June came three wet days; the rain came down, straight as lances,
and it was very, very cold. Nobody could go out, and everybody shivered.
They all went up to the door of Mother's room and knocked.

“Well, what is it?” asked Mother from inside.

“Mother,” said Bobbie, “mayn't I light a fire? I do know how.”

And Mother said: “No, my ducky-love. We mustn't have fires in June--coal
is so dear. If you're cold, go and have a good romp in the attic.
That'll warm you.”

“But, Mother, it only takes such a very little coal to make a fire.”

“It's more than we can afford, chickeny-love,” said Mother, cheerfully.
“Now run away, there's darlings--I'm madly busy!”

“Mother's always busy now,” said Phyllis, in a whisper to Peter. Peter
did not answer. He shrugged his shoulders. He was thinking.

Thought, however, could not long keep itself from the suitable
furnishing of a bandit's lair in the attic. Peter was the bandit, of
course. Bobbie was his lieutenant, his band of trusty robbers, and, in
due course, the parent of Phyllis, who was the captured maiden for whom
a magnificent ransom--in horse-beans--was unhesitatingly paid.

They all went down to tea flushed and joyous as any mountain brigands.

But when Phyllis was going to add jam to her bread and butter, Mother
said:--

“Jam OR butter, dear--not jam AND butter. We can't afford that sort of
reckless luxury nowadays.”

Phyllis finished the slice of bread and butter in silence, and followed
it up by bread and jam. Peter mingled thought and weak tea.

After tea they went back to the attic and he said to his sisters:--

“I have an idea.”

“What's that?” they asked politely.

“I shan't tell you,” was Peter's unexpected rejoinder.

“Oh, very well,” said Bobbie; and Phil said, “Don't, then.”

“Girls,” said Peter, “are always so hasty tempered.”

“I should like to know what boys are?” said Bobbie, with fine disdain.
“I don't want to know about your silly ideas.”

“You'll know some day,” said Peter, keeping his own temper by what
looked exactly like a miracle; “if you hadn't been so keen on a row, I
might have told you about it being only noble-heartedness that made me
not tell you my idea. But now I shan't tell you anything at all about
it--so there!”

And it was, indeed, some time before he could be induced to say
anything, and when he did it wasn't much. He said:--

“The only reason why I won't tell you my idea that I'm going to do is
because it MAY be wrong, and I don't want to drag you into it.”

“Don't you do it if it's wrong, Peter,” said Bobbie; “let me do it.” But
Phyllis said:--

“_I_ should like to do wrong if YOU'RE going to!”

“No,” said Peter, rather touched by this devotion; “it's a forlorn hope,
and I'm going to lead it. All I ask is that if Mother asks where I am,
you won't blab.”

“We haven't got anything TO blab,” said Bobbie, indignantly.

“Oh, yes, you have!” said Peter, dropping horse-beans through his
fingers. “I've trusted you to the death. You know I'm going to do a lone
adventure--and some people might think it wrong--I don't. And if Mother
asks where I am, say I'm playing at mines.”

“What sort of mines?”

“You just say mines.”

“You might tell US, Pete.”

“Well, then, COAL-mines. But don't you let the word pass your lips on
pain of torture.”

“You needn't threaten,” said Bobbie, “and I do think you might let us
help.”

“If I find a coal-mine, you shall help cart the coal,” Peter
condescended to promise.

“Keep your secret if you like,” said Phyllis.

“Keep it if you CAN,” said Bobbie.

“I'll keep it, right enough,” said Peter.

Between tea and supper there is an interval even in the most greedily
regulated families. At this time Mother was usually writing, and Mrs.
Viney had gone home.

Two nights after the dawning of Peter's idea he beckoned the girls
mysteriously at the twilight hour.

“Come hither with me,” he said, “and bring the Roman Chariot.”

The Roman Chariot was a very old perambulator that had spent years of
retirement in the loft over the coach-house. The children had oiled its
works till it glided noiseless as a pneumatic bicycle, and answered to
the helm as it had probably done in its best days.

“Follow your dauntless leader,” said Peter, and led the way down the
hill towards the station.

Just above the station many rocks have pushed their heads out through
the turf as though they, like the children, were interested in the
railway.

In a little hollow between three rocks lay a heap of dried brambles and
heather.

Peter halted, turned over the brushwood with a well-scarred boot, and
said:--

“Here's the first coal from the St. Peter's Mine. We'll take it home in
the chariot. Punctuality and despatch. All orders carefully attended to.
Any shaped lump cut to suit regular customers.”

The chariot was packed full of coal. And when it was packed it had to
be unpacked again because it was so heavy that it couldn't be got up the
hill by the three children, not even when Peter harnessed himself to the
handle with his braces, and firmly grasping his waistband in one hand
pulled while the girls pushed behind.

Three journeys had to be made before the coal from Peter's mine was
added to the heap of Mother's coal in the cellar.

Afterwards Peter went out alone, and came back very black and
mysterious.

“I've been to my coal-mine,” he said; “to-morrow evening we'll bring
home the black diamonds in the chariot.”

It was a week later that Mrs. Viney remarked to Mother how well this
last lot of coal was holding out.

The children hugged themselves and each other in complicated wriggles of
silent laughter as they listened on the stairs. They had all forgotten
by now that there had ever been any doubt in Peter's mind as to whether
coal-mining was wrong.

But there came a dreadful night when the Station Master put on a pair
of old sand shoes that he had worn at the seaside in his summer holiday,
and crept out very quietly to the yard where the Sodom and Gomorrah heap
of coal was, with the whitewashed line round it. He crept out there, and
he waited like a cat by a mousehole. On the top of the heap something
small and dark was scrabbling and rattling furtively among the coal.

The Station Master concealed himself in the shadow of a brake-van that
had a little tin chimney and was labelled:--

     G. N. and S. R.
          34576
    Return at once to
  White Heather Sidings

and in this concealment he lurked till the small thing on the top of
the heap ceased to scrabble and rattle, came to the edge of the heap,
cautiously let itself down, and lifted something after it. Then the arm
of the Station Master was raised, the hand of the Station Master fell
on a collar, and there was Peter firmly held by the jacket, with an old
carpenter's bag full of coal in his trembling clutch.

“So I've caught you at last, have I, you young thief?” said the Station
Master.

“I'm not a thief,” said Peter, as firmly as he could. “I'm a
coal-miner.”

“Tell that to the Marines,” said the Station Master.

“It would be just as true whoever I told it to,” said Peter.

“You're right there,” said the man, who held him. “Stow your jaw, you
young rip, and come along to the station.”

“Oh, no,” cried in the darkness an agonised voice that was not Peter's.

“Not the POLICE station!” said another voice from the darkness.

“Not yet,” said the Station Master. “The Railway Station first. Why,
it's a regular gang. Any more of you?”

“Only us,” said Bobbie and Phyllis, coming out of the shadow of another
truck labelled Staveley Colliery, and bearing on it the legend in white
chalk: 'Wanted in No. 1 Road.'

“What do you mean by spying on a fellow like this?” said Peter, angrily.

“Time someone did spy on you, _I_ think,” said the Station Master. “Come
along to the station.”

“Oh, DON'T!” said Bobbie. “Can't you decide NOW what you'll do to us?
It's our fault just as much as Peter's. We helped to carry the coal
away--and we knew where he got it.”

“No, you didn't,” said Peter.

“Yes, we did,” said Bobbie. “We knew all the time. We only pretended we
didn't just to humour you.”

Peter's cup was full. He had mined for coal, he had struck coal, he had
been caught, and now he learned that his sisters had 'humoured' him.

“Don't hold me!” he said. “I won't run away.”

The Station Master loosed Peter's collar, struck a match and looked at
them by its flickering light.

“Why,” said he, “you're the children from the Three Chimneys up yonder.
So nicely dressed, too. Tell me now, what made you do such a thing?
Haven't you ever been to church or learned your catechism or anything,
not to know it's wicked to steal?” He spoke much more gently now, and
Peter said:--

“I didn't think it was stealing. I was almost sure it wasn't. I thought
if I took it from the outside part of the heap, perhaps it would be. But
in the middle I thought I could fairly count it only mining. It'll
take thousands of years for you to burn up all that coal and get to the
middle parts.”

“Not quite. But did you do it for a lark or what?”

“Not much lark carting that beastly heavy stuff up the hill,” said
Peter, indignantly.

“Then why did you?” The Station Master's voice was so much kinder now
that Peter replied:--

“You know that wet day? Well, Mother said we were too poor to have a
fire. We always had fires when it was cold at our other house, and--”

“DON'T!” interrupted Bobbie, in a whisper.

“Well,” said the Station Master, rubbing his chin thoughtfully, “I'll
tell you what I'll do. I'll look over it this once. But you remember,
young gentleman, stealing is stealing, and what's mine isn't yours,
whether you call it mining or whether you don't. Run along home.”

“Do you mean you aren't going to do anything to us? Well, you are a
brick,” said Peter, with enthusiasm.

“You're a dear,” said Bobbie.

“You're a darling,” said Phyllis.

“That's all right,” said the Station Master.

And on this they parted.

“Don't speak to me,” said Peter, as the three went up the hill. “You're
spies and traitors--that's what you are.”

But the girls were too glad to have Peter between them, safe and free,
and on the way to Three Chimneys and not to the Police Station, to mind
much what he said.

“We DID say it was us as much as you,” said Bobbie, gently.

“Well--and it wasn't.”

“It would have come to the same thing in Courts with judges,” said
Phyllis. “Don't be snarky, Peter. It isn't our fault your secrets are so
jolly easy to find out.” She took his arm, and he let her.

“There's an awful lot of coal in the cellar, anyhow,” he went on.

“Oh, don't!” said Bobbie. “I don't think we ought to be glad about
THAT.”

“I don't know,” said Peter, plucking up a spirit. “I'm not at all sure,
even now, that mining is a crime.”

But the girls were quite sure. And they were also quite sure that he was
quite sure, however little he cared to own it.



Chapter III. The old gentleman.


After the adventure of Peter's Coal-mine, it seemed well to the children
to keep away from the station--but they did not, they could not, keep
away from the railway. They had lived all their lives in a street where
cabs and omnibuses rumbled by at all hours, and the carts of butchers
and bakers and candlestick makers (I never saw a candlestick-maker's
cart; did you?) might occur at any moment. Here in the deep silence of
the sleeping country the only things that went by were the trains. They
seemed to be all that was left to link the children to the old life that
had once been theirs. Straight down the hill in front of Three Chimneys
the daily passage of their six feet began to mark a path across the
crisp, short turf. They began to know the hours when certain trains
passed, and they gave names to them. The 9.15 up was called the Green
Dragon. The 10.7 down was the Worm of Wantley. The midnight town
express, whose shrieking rush they sometimes woke from their dreams
to hear, was the Fearsome Fly-by-night. Peter got up once, in chill
starshine, and, peeping at it through his curtains, named it on the
spot.

It was by the Green Dragon that the old gentleman travelled. He was a
very nice-looking old gentleman, and he looked as if he were nice,
too, which is not at all the same thing. He had a fresh-coloured,
clean-shaven face and white hair, and he wore rather odd-shaped collars
and a top-hat that wasn't exactly the same kind as other people's. Of
course the children didn't see all this at first. In fact the first
thing they noticed about the old gentleman was his hand.

It was one morning as they sat on the fence waiting for the Green
Dragon, which was three and a quarter minutes late by Peter's Waterbury
watch that he had had given him on his last birthday.

“The Green Dragon's going where Father is,” said Phyllis; “if it were
a really real dragon, we could stop it and ask it to take our love to
Father.”

“Dragons don't carry people's love,” said Peter; “they'd be above it.”

“Yes, they do, if you tame them thoroughly first. They fetch and carry
like pet spaniels,” said Phyllis, “and feed out of your hand. I wonder
why Father never writes to us.”

“Mother says he's been too busy,” said Bobbie; “but he'll write soon,
she says.”

“I say,” Phyllis suggested, “let's all wave to the Green Dragon as it
goes by. If it's a magic dragon, it'll understand and take our loves to
Father. And if it isn't, three waves aren't much. We shall never miss
them.”

So when the Green Dragon tore shrieking out of the mouth of its dark
lair, which was the tunnel, all three children stood on the railing and
waved their pocket-handkerchiefs without stopping to think whether they
were clean handkerchiefs or the reverse. They were, as a matter of fact,
very much the reverse.

And out of a first-class carriage a hand waved back. A quite clean hand.
It held a newspaper. It was the old gentleman's hand.

After this it became the custom for waves to be exchanged between the
children and the 9.15.

And the children, especially the girls, liked to think that perhaps the
old gentleman knew Father, and would meet him 'in business,' wherever
that shady retreat might be, and tell him how his three children stood
on a rail far away in the green country and waved their love to him
every morning, wet or fine.

For they were now able to go out in all sorts of weather such as they
would never have been allowed to go out in when they lived in their
villa house. This was Aunt Emma's doing, and the children felt more and
more that they had not been quite fair to this unattractive aunt, when
they found how useful were the long gaiters and waterproof coats that
they had laughed at her for buying for them.

Mother, all this time, was very busy with her writing. She used to send
off a good many long blue envelopes with stories in them--and large
envelopes of different sizes and colours used to come to her. Sometimes
she would sigh when she opened them and say:--

“Another story come home to roost. Oh, dear, Oh, dear!” and then the
children would be very sorry.

But sometimes she would wave the envelope in the air and say:--“Hooray,
hooray. Here's a sensible Editor. He's taken my story and this is the
proof of it.”

At first the children thought 'the Proof' meant the letter the sensible
Editor had written, but they presently got to know that the proof was
long slips of paper with the story printed on them.

Whenever an Editor was sensible there were buns for tea.

One day Peter was going down to the village to get buns to celebrate
the sensibleness of the Editor of the Children's Globe, when he met the
Station Master.

Peter felt very uncomfortable, for he had now had time to think over the
affair of the coal-mine. He did not like to say “Good morning” to the
Station Master, as you usually do to anyone you meet on a lonely road,
because he had a hot feeling, which spread even to his ears, that the
Station Master might not care to speak to a person who had stolen coals.
'Stolen' is a nasty word, but Peter felt it was the right one. So he
looked down, and said Nothing.

It was the Station Master who said “Good morning” as he passed by. And
Peter answered, “Good morning.” Then he thought:--

“Perhaps he doesn't know who I am by daylight, or he wouldn't be so
polite.”

And he did not like the feeling which thinking this gave him. And then
before he knew what he was going to do he ran after the Station Master,
who stopped when he heard Peter's hasty boots crunching the road,
and coming up with him very breathless and with his ears now quite
magenta-coloured, he said:--

“I don't want you to be polite to me if you don't know me when you see
me.”

“Eh?” said the Station Master.

“I thought perhaps you didn't know it was me that took the coals,”
 Peter went on, “when you said 'Good morning.' But it was, and I'm sorry.
There.”

“Why,” said the Station Master, “I wasn't thinking anything at all about
the precious coals. Let bygones be bygones. And where were you off to in
such a hurry?”

“I'm going to buy buns for tea,” said Peter.

“I thought you were all so poor,” said the Station Master.

“So we are,” said Peter, confidentially, “but we always have three
pennyworth of halfpennies for tea whenever Mother sells a story or a
poem or anything.”

“Oh,” said the Station Master, “so your Mother writes stories, does
she?”

“The beautifulest you ever read,” said Peter.

“You ought to be very proud to have such a clever Mother.”

“Yes,” said Peter, “but she used to play with us more before she had to
be so clever.”

“Well,” said the Station Master, “I must be getting along. You give us
a look in at the Station whenever you feel so inclined. And as to coals,
it's a word that--well--oh, no, we never mention it, eh?”

“Thank you,” said Peter. “I'm very glad it's all straightened out
between us.” And he went on across the canal bridge to the village to
get the buns, feeling more comfortable in his mind than he had felt
since the hand of the Station Master had fastened on his collar that
night among the coals.

Next day when they had sent the threefold wave of greeting to Father by
the Green Dragon, and the old gentleman had waved back as usual, Peter
proudly led the way to the station.

“But ought we?” said Bobbie.

“After the coals, she means,” Phyllis explained.

“I met the Station Master yesterday,” said Peter, in an offhand way,
and he pretended not to hear what Phyllis had said; “he expresspecially
invited us to go down any time we liked.”

“After the coals?” repeated Phyllis. “Stop a minute--my bootlace is
undone again.”

“It always IS undone again,” said Peter, “and the Station Master was
more of a gentleman than you'll ever be, Phil--throwing coal at a chap's
head like that.”

Phyllis did up her bootlace and went on in silence, but her shoulders
shook, and presently a fat tear fell off her nose and splashed on the
metal of the railway line. Bobbie saw it.

“Why, what's the matter, darling?” she said, stopping short and putting
her arm round the heaving shoulders.

“He called me un-un-ungentlemanly,” sobbed Phyllis. “I didn't never call
him unladylike, not even when he tied my Clorinda to the firewood bundle
and burned her at the stake for a martyr.”

Peter had indeed perpetrated this outrage a year or two before.

“Well, you began, you know,” said Bobbie, honestly, “about coals and all
that. Don't you think you'd better both unsay everything since the wave,
and let honour be satisfied?”

“I will if Peter will,” said Phyllis, sniffling.

“All right,” said Peter; “honour is satisfied. Here, use my hankie,
Phil, for goodness' sake, if you've lost yours as usual. I wonder what
you do with them.”

“You had my last one,” said Phyllis, indignantly, “to tie up the
rabbit-hutch door with. But you're very ungrateful. It's quite right
what it says in the poetry book about sharper than a serpent it is to
have a toothless child--but it means ungrateful when it says toothless.
Miss Lowe told me so.”

“All right,” said Peter, impatiently, “I'm sorry. THERE! Now will you
come on?”

They reached the station and spent a joyous two hours with the Porter.
He was a worthy man and seemed never tired of answering the questions
that begin with “Why--” which many people in higher ranks of life often
seem weary of.

He told them many things that they had not known before--as, for
instance, that the things that hook carriages together are called
couplings, and that the pipes like great serpents that hang over the
couplings are meant to stop the train with.

“If you could get a holt of one o' them when the train is going and pull
'em apart,” said he, “she'd stop dead off with a jerk.”

“Who's she?” said Phyllis.

“The train, of course,” said the Porter. After that the train was never
again 'It' to the children.

“And you know the thing in the carriages where it says on it, 'Five
pounds' fine for improper use.' If you was to improperly use that, the
train 'ud stop.”

“And if you used it properly?” said Roberta.

“It 'ud stop just the same, I suppose,” said he, “but it isn't proper
use unless you're being murdered. There was an old lady once--someone
kidded her on it was a refreshment-room bell, and she used it improper,
not being in danger of her life, though hungry, and when the train
stopped and the guard came along expecting to find someone weltering in
their last moments, she says, 'Oh, please, Mister, I'll take a glass of
stout and a bath bun,' she says. And the train was seven minutes behind
her time as it was.”

“What did the guard say to the old lady?”

“_I_ dunno,” replied the Porter, “but I lay she didn't forget it in a
hurry, whatever it was.”

In such delightful conversation the time went by all too quickly.

The Station Master came out once or twice from that sacred inner temple
behind the place where the hole is that they sell you tickets through,
and was most jolly with them all.

“Just as if coal had never been discovered,” Phyllis whispered to her
sister.

He gave them each an orange, and promised to take them up into the
signal-box one of these days, when he wasn't so busy.

Several trains went through the station, and Peter noticed for the first
time that engines have numbers on them, like cabs.

“Yes,” said the Porter, “I knowed a young gent as used to take down the
numbers of every single one he seed; in a green note-book with silver
corners it was, owing to his father being very well-to-do in the
wholesale stationery.”

Peter felt that he could take down numbers, too, even if he was not
the son of a wholesale stationer. As he did not happen to have a green
leather note-book with silver corners, the Porter gave him a yellow
envelope and on it he noted:--

     379
     663

and felt that this was the beginning of what would be a most interesting
collection.

That night at tea he asked Mother if she had a green leather note-book
with silver corners. She had not; but when she heard what he wanted it
for she gave him a little black one.

“It has a few pages torn out,” said she; “but it will hold quite a lot
of numbers, and when it's full I'll give you another. I'm so glad you
like the railway. Only, please, you mustn't walk on the line.”

“Not if we face the way the train's coming?” asked Peter, after a gloomy
pause, in which glances of despair were exchanged.

“No--really not,” said Mother.

Then Phyllis said, “Mother, didn't YOU ever walk on the railway lines
when you were little?”

Mother was an honest and honourable Mother, so she had to say, “Yes.”

“Well, then,” said Phyllis.

“But, darlings, you don't know how fond I am of you. What should I do if
you got hurt?”

“Are you fonder of us than Granny was of you when you were little?”
 Phyllis asked. Bobbie made signs to her to stop, but Phyllis never did
see signs, no matter how plain they might be.

Mother did not answer for a minute. She got up to put more water in the
teapot.

“No one,” she said at last, “ever loved anyone more than my mother loved
me.”

Then she was quiet again, and Bobbie kicked Phyllis hard under the
table, because Bobbie understood a little bit the thoughts that were
making Mother so quiet--the thoughts of the time when Mother was a
little girl and was all the world to HER mother. It seems so easy and
natural to run to Mother when one is in trouble. Bobbie understood a
little how people do not leave off running to their mothers when they
are in trouble even when they are grown up, and she thought she knew a
little what it must be to be sad, and have no mother to run to any more.

So she kicked Phyllis, who said:--

“What are you kicking me like that for, Bob?”

And then Mother laughed a little and sighed and said:--

“Very well, then. Only let me be sure you do know which way the trains
come--and don't walk on the line near the tunnel or near corners.”

“Trains keep to the left like carriages,” said Peter, “so if we keep to
the right, we're bound to see them coming.”

“Very well,” said Mother, and I dare say you think that she ought not
to have said it. But she remembered about when she was a little girl
herself, and she did say it--and neither her own children nor you nor
any other children in the world could ever understand exactly what it
cost her to do it. Only some few of you, like Bobbie, may understand a
very little bit.

It was the very next day that Mother had to stay in bed because her head
ached so. Her hands were burning hot, and she would not eat anything,
and her throat was very sore.

“If I was you, Mum,” said Mrs. Viney, “I should take and send for the
doctor. There's a lot of catchy complaints a-going about just now. My
sister's eldest--she took a chill and it went to her inside, two years
ago come Christmas, and she's never been the same gell since.”

Mother wouldn't at first, but in the evening she felt so much worse that
Peter was sent to the house in the village that had three laburnum trees
by the gate, and on the gate a brass plate with W. W. Forrest, M.D., on
it.

W. W. Forrest, M.D., came at once. He talked to Peter on the way back.
He seemed a most charming and sensible man, interested in railways, and
rabbits, and really important things.

When he had seen Mother, he said it was influenza.

“Now, Lady Grave-airs,” he said in the hall to Bobbie, “I suppose you'll
want to be head-nurse.”

“Of course,” said she.

“Well, then, I'll send down some medicine. Keep up a good fire. Have
some strong beef tea made ready to give her as soon as the fever goes
down. She can have grapes now, and beef essence--and soda-water and
milk, and you'd better get in a bottle of brandy. The best brandy. Cheap
brandy is worse than poison.”

She asked him to write it all down, and he did.

When Bobbie showed Mother the list he had written, Mother laughed. It
WAS a laugh, Bobbie decided, though it was rather odd and feeble.

“Nonsense,” said Mother, laying in bed with eyes as bright as beads.
“I can't afford all that rubbish. Tell Mrs. Viney to boil two pounds of
scrag-end of the neck for your dinners to-morrow, and I can have some
of the broth. Yes, I should like some more water now, love. And will you
get a basin and sponge my hands?”

Roberta obeyed. When she had done everything she could to make Mother
less uncomfortable, she went down to the others. Her cheeks were very
red, her lips set tight, and her eyes almost as bright as Mother's.

She told them what the Doctor had said, and what Mother had said.

“And now,” said she, when she had told all, “there's no one but us to do
anything, and we've got to do it. I've got the shilling for the mutton.”

“We can do without the beastly mutton,” said Peter; “bread and butter
will support life. People have lived on less on desert islands many a
time.”

“Of course,” said his sister. And Mrs. Viney was sent to the village to
get as much brandy and soda-water and beef tea as she could buy for a
shilling.

“But even if we never have anything to eat at all,” said Phyllis, “you
can't get all those other things with our dinner money.”

“No,” said Bobbie, frowning, “we must find out some other way. Now
THINK, everybody, just as hard as ever you can.”

They did think. And presently they talked. And later, when Bobbie had
gone up to sit with Mother in case she wanted anything, the other two
were very busy with scissors and a white sheet, and a paint brush, and
the pot of Brunswick black that Mrs. Viney used for grates and fenders.
They did not manage to do what they wished, exactly, with the first
sheet, so they took another out of the linen cupboard. It did not occur
to them that they were spoiling good sheets which cost good money. They
only knew that they were making a good--but what they were making comes
later.

Bobbie's bed had been moved into Mother's room, and several times in
the night she got up to mend the fire, and to give her mother milk and
soda-water. Mother talked to herself a good deal, but it did not seem
to mean anything. And once she woke up suddenly and called out: “Mamma,
mamma!” and Bobbie knew she was calling for Granny, and that she had
forgotten that it was no use calling, because Granny was dead.

In the early morning Bobbie heard her name and jumped out of bed and ran
to Mother's bedside.

“Oh--ah, yes--I think I was asleep,” said Mother. “My poor little duck,
how tired you'll be--I do hate to give you all this trouble.”

“Trouble!” said Bobbie.

“Ah, don't cry, sweet,” Mother said; “I shall be all right in a day or
two.”

And Bobbie said, “Yes,” and tried to smile.

When you are used to ten hours of solid sleep, to get up three or four
times in your sleep-time makes you feel as though you had been up all
night. Bobbie felt quite stupid and her eyes were sore and stiff, but
she tidied the room, and arranged everything neatly before the Doctor
came.

This was at half-past eight.

“Everything going on all right, little Nurse?” he said at the front
door. “Did you get the brandy?”

“I've got the brandy,” said Bobbie, “in a little flat bottle.”

“I didn't see the grapes or the beef tea, though,” said he.

“No,” said Bobbie, firmly, “but you will to-morrow. And there's some
beef stewing in the oven for beef tea.”

“Who told you to do that?” he asked.

“I noticed what Mother did when Phil had mumps.”

“Right,” said the Doctor. “Now you get your old woman to sit with your
mother, and then you eat a good breakfast, and go straight to bed and
sleep till dinner-time. We can't afford to have the head-nurse ill.”

He was really quite a nice doctor.

When the 9.15 came out of the tunnel that morning the old gentleman in
the first-class carriage put down his newspaper, and got ready to wave
his hand to the three children on the fence. But this morning there were
not three. There was only one. And that was Peter.

Peter was not on the railings either, as usual. He was standing in front
of them in an attitude like that of a show-man showing off the animals
in a menagerie, or of the kind clergyman when he points with a wand at
the 'Scenes from Palestine,' when there is a magic-lantern and he is
explaining it.

Peter was pointing, too. And what he was pointing at was a large white
sheet nailed against the fence. On the sheet there were thick black
letters more than a foot long.

Some of them had run a little, because of Phyllis having put the
Brunswick black on too eagerly, but the words were quite easy to read.

And this what the old gentleman and several other people in the train
read in the large black letters on the white sheet:--

     LOOK OUT AT THE STATION.

A good many people did look out at the station and were disappointed,
for they saw nothing unusual. The old gentleman looked out, too, and at
first he too saw nothing more unusual than the gravelled platform and
the sunshine and the wallflowers and forget-me-nots in the station
borders. It was only just as the train was beginning to puff and pull
itself together to start again that he saw Phyllis. She was quite out of
breath with running.

“Oh,” she said, “I thought I'd missed you. My bootlaces would keep
coming down and I fell over them twice. Here, take it.”

She thrust a warm, dampish letter into his hand as the train moved.

He leaned back in his corner and opened the letter. This is what he
read:--

“Dear Mr. We do not know your name.

Mother is ill and the doctor says to give her the things at the end of
the letter, but she says she can't aford it, and to get mutton for
us and she will have the broth. We do not know anybody here but you,
because Father is away and we do not know the address. Father will pay
you, or if he has lost all his money, or anything, Peter will pay you
when he is a man. We promise it on our honer. I.O.U. for all the things
Mother wants.

     “sined Peter.

“Will you give the parsel to the Station Master, because of us not
knowing what train you come down by? Say it is for Peter that was sorry
about the coals and he will know all right.

     “Roberta.
     “Phyllis.
     “Peter.”

Then came the list of things the Doctor had ordered.

The old gentleman read it through once, and his eyebrows went up. He
read it twice and smiled a little. When he had read it thrice, he put it
in his pocket and went on reading The Times.

At about six that evening there was a knock at the back door. The three
children rushed to open it, and there stood the friendly Porter, who had
told them so many interesting things about railways. He dumped down a
big hamper on the kitchen flags.

“Old gent,” he said; “he asked me to fetch it up straight away.”

“Thank you very much,” said Peter, and then, as the Porter lingered, he
added:--

“I'm most awfully sorry I haven't got twopence to give you like Father
does, but--”

“You drop it if you please,” said the Porter, indignantly. “I wasn't
thinking about no tuppences. I only wanted to say I was sorry your Mamma
wasn't so well, and to ask how she finds herself this evening--and
I've fetched her along a bit of sweetbrier, very sweet to smell it is.
Twopence indeed,” said he, and produced a bunch of sweetbrier from his
hat, “just like a conjurer,” as Phyllis remarked afterwards.

“Thank you very much,” said Peter, “and I beg your pardon about the
twopence.”

“No offence,” said the Porter, untruly but politely, and went.

Then the children undid the hamper. First there was straw, and then
there were fine shavings, and then came all the things they had asked
for, and plenty of them, and then a good many things they had not asked
for; among others peaches and port wine and two chickens, a cardboard
box of big red roses with long stalks, and a tall thin green bottle
of lavender water, and three smaller fatter bottles of eau-de-Cologne.
There was a letter, too.

“Dear Roberta and Phyllis and Peter,” it said; “here are the things you
want. Your mother will want to know where they came from. Tell her they
were sent by a friend who heard she was ill. When she is well again you
must tell her all about it, of course. And if she says you ought not to
have asked for the things, tell her that I say you were quite right,
and that I hope she will forgive me for taking the liberty of allowing
myself a very great pleasure.”

The letter was signed G. P. something that the children couldn't read.

“I think we WERE right,” said Phyllis.

“Right? Of course we were right,” said Bobbie.

“All the same,” said Peter, with his hands in his pockets, “I don't
exactly look forward to telling Mother the whole truth about it.”

“We're not to do it till she's well,” said Bobbie, “and when she's well
we shall be so happy we shan't mind a little fuss like that. Oh, just
look at the roses! I must take them up to her.”

“And the sweetbrier,” said Phyllis, sniffing it loudly; “don't forget
the sweetbrier.”

“As if I should!” said Roberta. “Mother told me the other day there was
a thick hedge of it at her mother's house when she was a little girl.”



Chapter IV. The engine-burglar.


What was left of the second sheet and the Brunswick black came in very
nicely to make a banner bearing the legend

     SHE IS NEARLY WELL THANK YOU

and this was displayed to the Green Dragon about a fortnight after the
arrival of the wonderful hamper. The old gentleman saw it, and waved
a cheerful response from the train. And when this had been done the
children saw that now was the time when they must tell Mother what they
had done when she was ill. And it did not seem nearly so easy as they
had thought it would be. But it had to be done. And it was done. Mother
was extremely angry. She was seldom angry, and now she was angrier than
they had ever known her. This was horrible. But it was much worse when
she suddenly began to cry. Crying is catching, I believe, like measles
and whooping-cough. At any rate, everyone at once found itself taking
part in a crying-party.

Mother stopped first. She dried her eyes and then she said:--

“I'm sorry I was so angry, darlings, because I know you didn't
understand.”

“We didn't mean to be naughty, Mammy,” sobbed Bobbie, and Peter and
Phyllis sniffed.

“Now, listen,” said Mother; “it's quite true that we're poor, but
we have enough to live on. You mustn't go telling everyone about our
affairs--it's not right. And you must never, never, never ask strangers
to give you things. Now always remember that--won't you?”

They all hugged her and rubbed their damp cheeks against hers and
promised that they would.

“And I'll write a letter to your old gentleman, and I shall tell him
that I didn't approve--oh, of course I shall thank him, too, for
his kindness. It's YOU I don't approve of, my darlings, not the old
gentleman. He was as kind as ever he could be. And you can give the
letter to the Station Master to give him--and we won't say any more
about it.”

Afterwards, when the children were alone, Bobbie said:--

“Isn't Mother splendid? You catch any other grown-up saying they were
sorry they had been angry.”

“Yes,” said Peter, “she IS splendid; but it's rather awful when she's
angry.”

“She's like Avenging and Bright in the song,” said Phyllis. “I should
like to look at her if it wasn't so awful. She looks so beautiful when
she's really downright furious.”

They took the letter down to the Station Master.

“I thought you said you hadn't got any friends except in London,” said
he.

“We've made him since,” said Peter.

“But he doesn't live hereabouts?”

“No--we just know him on the railway.”

Then the Station Master retired to that sacred inner temple behind the
little window where the tickets are sold, and the children went down
to the Porters' room and talked to the Porter. They learned several
interesting things from him--among others that his name was Perks,
that he was married and had three children, that the lamps in front of
engines are called head-lights and the ones at the back tail-lights.

“And that just shows,” whispered Phyllis, “that trains really ARE
dragons in disguise, with proper heads and tails.”

It was on this day that the children first noticed that all engines are
not alike.

“Alike?” said the Porter, whose name was Perks, “lor, love you, no,
Miss. No more alike nor what you an' me are. That little 'un without
a tender as went by just now all on her own, that was a tank, that
was--she's off to do some shunting t'other side o' Maidbridge. That's as
it might be you, Miss. Then there's goods engines, great, strong things
with three wheels each side--joined with rods to strengthen 'em--as it
might be me. Then there's main-line engines as it might be this
'ere young gentleman when he grows up and wins all the races at 'is
school--so he will. The main-line engine she's built for speed as well
as power. That's one to the 9.15 up.”

“The Green Dragon,” said Phyllis.

“We calls her the Snail, Miss, among ourselves,” said the Porter. “She's
oftener be'ind'and nor any train on the line.”

“But the engine's green,” said Phyllis.

“Yes, Miss,” said Perks, “so's a snail some seasons o' the year.”

The children agreed as they went home to dinner that the Porter was most
delightful company.

Next day was Roberta's birthday. In the afternoon she was politely but
firmly requested to get out of the way and keep there till tea-time.

“You aren't to see what we're going to do till it's done; it's a
glorious surprise,” said Phyllis.

And Roberta went out into the garden all alone. She tried to be
grateful, but she felt she would much rather have helped in whatever it
was than have to spend her birthday afternoon by herself, no matter how
glorious the surprise might be.

Now that she was alone, she had time to think, and one of the things she
thought of most was what mother had said in one of those feverish nights
when her hands were so hot and her eyes so bright.

The words were: “Oh, what a doctor's bill there'll be for this!”

She walked round and round the garden among the rose-bushes that hadn't
any roses yet, only buds, and the lilac bushes and syringas and American
currants, and the more she thought of the doctor's bill, the less she
liked the thought of it.

And presently she made up her mind. She went out through the side door
of the garden and climbed up the steep field to where the road runs
along by the canal. She walked along until she came to the bridge that
crosses the canal and leads to the village, and here she waited. It was
very pleasant in the sunshine to lean one's elbows on the warm stone
of the bridge and look down at the blue water of the canal. Bobbie had
never seen any other canal, except the Regent's Canal, and the water of
that is not at all a pretty colour. And she had never seen any river at
all except the Thames, which also would be all the better if its face
was washed.

Perhaps the children would have loved the canal as much as the railway,
but for two things. One was that they had found the railway FIRST--on
that first, wonderful morning when the house and the country and the
moors and rocks and great hills were all new to them. They had not found
the canal till some days later. The other reason was that everyone on
the railway had been kind to them--the Station Master, the Porter, and
the old gentleman who waved. And the people on the canal were anything
but kind.

The people on the canal were, of course, the bargees, who steered the
slow barges up and down, or walked beside the old horses that trampled
up the mud of the towing-path, and strained at the long tow-ropes.

Peter had once asked one of the bargees the time, and had been told
to “get out of that,” in a tone so fierce that he did not stop to say
anything about his having just as much right on the towing-path as the
man himself. Indeed, he did not even think of saying it till some time
later.

Then another day when the children thought they would like to fish in
the canal, a boy in a barge threw lumps of coal at them, and one of
these hit Phyllis on the back of the neck. She was just stooping down to
tie up her bootlace--and though the coal hardly hurt at all it made her
not care very much about going on fishing.

On the bridge, however, Roberta felt quite safe, because she could look
down on the canal, and if any boy showed signs of meaning to throw coal,
she could duck behind the parapet.

Presently there was a sound of wheels, which was just what she expected.

The wheels were the wheels of the Doctor's dogcart, and in the cart, of
course, was the Doctor.

He pulled up, and called out:--

“Hullo, head nurse! Want a lift?”

“I wanted to see you,” said Bobbie.

“Your mother's not worse, I hope?” said the Doctor.

“No--but--”

“Well, skip in, then, and we'll go for a drive.”

Roberta climbed in and the brown horse was made to turn round--which it
did not like at all, for it was looking forward to its tea--I mean its
oats.

“This IS jolly,” said Bobbie, as the dogcart flew along the road by the
canal.

“We could throw a stone down any one of your three chimneys,” said the
Doctor, as they passed the house.

“Yes,” said Bobbie, “but you'd have to be a jolly good shot.”

“How do you know I'm not?” said the Doctor. “Now, then, what's the
trouble?”

Bobbie fidgeted with the hook of the driving apron.

“Come, out with it,” said the Doctor.

“It's rather hard, you see,” said Bobbie, “to out with it; because of
what Mother said.”

“What DID Mother say?”

“She said I wasn't to go telling everyone that we're poor. But you
aren't everyone, are you?”

“Not at all,” said the Doctor, cheerfully. “Well?”

“Well, I know doctors are very extravagant--I mean expensive, and Mrs.
Viney told me that her doctoring only cost her twopence a week because
she belonged to a Club.”

“Yes?”

“You see she told me what a good doctor you were, and I asked her how
she could afford you, because she's much poorer than we are. I've been
in her house and I know. And then she told me about the Club, and I
thought I'd ask you--and--oh, I don't want Mother to be worried! Can't
we be in the Club, too, the same as Mrs. Viney?”

The Doctor was silent. He was rather poor himself, and he had been
pleased at getting a new family to attend. So I think his feelings at
that minute were rather mixed.

“You aren't cross with me, are you?” said Bobbie, in a very small voice.

The Doctor roused himself.

“Cross? How could I be? You're a very sensible little woman. Now look
here, don't you worry. I'll make it all right with your Mother, even if
I have to make a special brand-new Club all for her. Look here, this is
where the Aqueduct begins.”

“What's an Aque--what's its name?” asked Bobbie.

“A water bridge,” said the Doctor. “Look.”

The road rose to a bridge over the canal. To the left was a steep rocky
cliff with trees and shrubs growing in the cracks of the rock. And the
canal here left off running along the top of the hill and started to run
on a bridge of its own--a great bridge with tall arches that went right
across the valley.

Bobbie drew a long breath.

“It IS grand, isn't it?” she said. “It's like pictures in the History of
Rome.”

“Right!” said the Doctor, “that's just exactly what it IS like.
The Romans were dead nuts on aqueducts. It's a splendid piece of
engineering.”

“I thought engineering was making engines.”

“Ah, there are different sorts of engineering--making road and bridges
and tunnels is one kind. And making fortifications is another. Well, we
must be turning back. And, remember, you aren't to worry about doctor's
bills or you'll be ill yourself, and then I'll send you in a bill as
long as the aqueduct.”

When Bobbie had parted from the Doctor at the top of the field that ran
down from the road to Three Chimneys, she could not feel that she had
done wrong. She knew that Mother would perhaps think differently.
But Bobbie felt that for once she was the one who was right, and she
scrambled down the rocky slope with a really happy feeling.

Phyllis and Peter met her at the back door. They were unnaturally clean
and neat, and Phyllis had a red bow in her hair. There was only just
time for Bobbie to make herself tidy and tie up her hair with a blue bow
before a little bell rang.

“There!” said Phyllis, “that's to show the surprise is ready. Now
you wait till the bell rings again and then you may come into the
dining-room.”

So Bobbie waited.

“Tinkle, tinkle,” said the little bell, and Bobbie went into the
dining-room, feeling rather shy. Directly she opened the door she found
herself, as it seemed, in a new world of light and flowers and singing.
Mother and Peter and Phyllis were standing in a row at the end of the
table. The shutters were shut and there were twelve candles on the
table, one for each of Roberta's years. The table was covered with a
sort of pattern of flowers, and at Roberta's place was a thick wreath of
forget-me-nots and several most interesting little packages. And Mother
and Phyllis and Peter were singing--to the first part of the tune of St.
Patrick's Day. Roberta knew that Mother had written the words on purpose
for her birthday. It was a little way of Mother's on birthdays. It
had begun on Bobbie's fourth birthday when Phyllis was a baby. Bobbie
remembered learning the verses to say to Father 'for a surprise.' She
wondered if Mother had remembered, too. The four-year-old verse had
been:--

     Daddy dear, I'm only four
     And I'd rather not be more.
     Four's the nicest age to be,
     Two and two and one and three.
     What I love is two and two,
     Mother, Peter, Phil, and you.
     What you love is one and three,
     Mother, Peter, Phil, and me.
     Give your little girl a kiss
     Because she learned and told you this.

The song the others were singing now went like this:--

     Our darling Roberta,
     No sorrow shall hurt her
     If we can prevent it
        Her whole life long.
     Her birthday's our fete day,
     We'll make it our great day,
     And give her our presents
        And sing her our song.
     May pleasures attend her
     And may the Fates send her
     The happiest journey
        Along her life's way.
     With skies bright above her
     And dear ones to love her!
     Dear Bob!  Many happy
        Returns of the day!

When they had finished singing they cried, “Three cheers for our
Bobbie!” and gave them very loudly. Bobbie felt exactly as though she
were going to cry--you know that odd feeling in the bridge of your nose
and the pricking in your eyelids? But before she had time to begin they
were all kissing and hugging her.

“Now,” said Mother, “look at your presents.”

They were very nice presents. There was a green and red needle-book that
Phyllis had made herself in secret moments. There was a darling little
silver brooch of Mother's shaped like a buttercup, which Bobbie had
known and loved for years, but which she had never, never thought would
come to be her very own. There was also a pair of blue glass vases from
Mrs. Viney. Roberta had seen and admired them in the village shop. And
there were three birthday cards with pretty pictures and wishes.

Mother fitted the forget-me-not crown on Bobbie's brown head.

“And now look at the table,” she said.

There was a cake on the table covered with white sugar, with 'Dear
Bobbie' on it in pink sweets, and there were buns and jam; but
the nicest thing was that the big table was almost covered with
flowers--wallflowers were laid all round the tea-tray--there was a ring
of forget-me-nots round each plate. The cake had a wreath of white lilac
round it, and in the middle was something that looked like a pattern all
done with single blooms of lilac or wallflower or laburnum.

“It's a map--a map of the railway!” cried Peter. “Look--those lilac
lines are the metals--and there's the station done in brown wallflowers.
The laburnum is the train, and there are the signal-boxes, and the road
up to here--and those fat red daisies are us three waving to the old
gentleman--that's him, the pansy in the laburnum train.”

“And there's 'Three Chimneys' done in the purple primroses,” said
Phyllis. “And that little tiny rose-bud is Mother looking out for us
when we're late for tea. Peter invented it all, and we got all the
flowers from the station. We thought you'd like it better.”

“That's my present,” said Peter, suddenly dumping down his adored
steam-engine on the table in front of her. Its tender had been lined
with fresh white paper, and was full of sweets.

“Oh, Peter!” cried Bobbie, quite overcome by this munificence, “not your
own dear little engine that you're so fond of?”

“Oh, no,” said Peter, very promptly, “not the engine. Only the sweets.”

Bobbie couldn't help her face changing a little--not so much because she
was disappointed at not getting the engine, as because she had thought
it so very noble of Peter, and now she felt she had been silly to think
it. Also she felt she must have seemed greedy to expect the engine as
well as the sweets. So her face changed. Peter saw it. He hesitated a
minute; then his face changed, too, and he said: “I mean not ALL the
engine. I'll let you go halves if you like.”

“You're a brick,” cried Bobbie; “it's a splendid present.” She said no
more aloud, but to herself she said:--

“That was awfully jolly decent of Peter because I know he didn't mean
to. Well, the broken half shall be my half of the engine, and I'll get
it mended and give it back to Peter for his birthday.”--“Yes, Mother
dear, I should like to cut the cake,” she added, and tea began.

It was a delightful birthday. After tea Mother played games with
them--any game they liked--and of course their first choice was
blindman's-buff, in the course of which Bobbie's forget-me-not wreath
twisted itself crookedly over one of her ears and stayed there. Then,
when it was near bed-time and time to calm down, Mother had a lovely new
story to read to them.

“You won't sit up late working, will you, Mother?” Bobbie asked as they
said good night.

And Mother said no, she wouldn't--she would only just write to Father
and then go to bed.

But when Bobbie crept down later to bring up her presents--for she felt
she really could not be separated from them all night--Mother was not
writing, but leaning her head on her arms and her arms on the table. I
think it was rather good of Bobbie to slip quietly away, saying over and
over, “She doesn't want me to know she's unhappy, and I won't know; I
won't know.” But it made a sad end to the birthday.

          *          *          *          *          *          *

The very next morning Bobbie began to watch her opportunity to get
Peter's engine mended secretly. And the opportunity came the very next
afternoon.

Mother went by train to the nearest town to do shopping. When she went
there, she always went to the Post-office. Perhaps to post her letters
to Father, for she never gave them to the children or Mrs. Viney to
post, and she never went to the village herself. Peter and Phyllis went
with her. Bobbie wanted an excuse not to go, but try as she would she
couldn't think of a good one. And just when she felt that all was lost,
her frock caught on a big nail by the kitchen door and there was a great
criss-cross tear all along the front of the skirt. I assure you this was
really an accident. So the others pitied her and went without her,
for there was no time for her to change, because they were rather late
already and had to hurry to the station to catch the train.

When they had gone, Bobbie put on her everyday frock, and went down to
the railway. She did not go into the station, but she went along the
line to the end of the platform where the engine is when the down train
is alongside the platform--the place where there are a water tank and
a long, limp, leather hose, like an elephant's trunk. She hid behind a
bush on the other side of the railway. She had the toy engine done up in
brown paper, and she waited patiently with it under her arm.

Then when the next train came in and stopped, Bobbie went across the
metals of the up-line and stood beside the engine. She had never been so
close to an engine before. It looked much larger and harder than she
had expected, and it made her feel very small indeed, and, somehow, very
soft--as if she could very, very easily be hurt rather badly.

“I know what silk-worms feel like now,” said Bobbie to herself.

The engine-driver and fireman did not see her. They were leaning out
on the other side, telling the Porter a tale about a dog and a leg of
mutton.

“If you please,” said Roberta--but the engine was blowing off steam and
no one heard her.

“If you please, Mr. Engineer,” she spoke a little louder, but the Engine
happened to speak at the same moment, and of course Roberta's soft
little voice hadn't a chance.

It seemed to her that the only way would be to climb on to the engine
and pull at their coats. The step was high, but she got her knee on it,
and clambered into the cab; she stumbled and fell on hands and knees on
the base of the great heap of coals that led up to the square opening in
the tender. The engine was not above the weaknesses of its fellows; it
was making a great deal more noise than there was the slightest need
for. And just as Roberta fell on the coals, the engine-driver, who
had turned without seeing her, started the engine, and when Bobbie had
picked herself up, the train was moving--not fast, but much too fast for
her to get off.

All sorts of dreadful thoughts came to her all together in one horrible
flash. There were such things as express trains that went on, she
supposed, for hundreds of miles without stopping. Suppose this should be
one of them? How would she get home again? She had no money to pay for
the return journey.

“And I've no business here. I'm an engine-burglar--that's what I am,”
 she thought. “I shouldn't wonder if they could lock me up for this.” And
the train was going faster and faster.

There was something in her throat that made it impossible for her to
speak. She tried twice. The men had their backs to her. They were doing
something to things that looked like taps.

Suddenly she put out her hand and caught hold of the nearest sleeve. The
man turned with a start, and he and Roberta stood for a minute looking
at each other in silence. Then the silence was broken by them both.

The man said, “Here's a bloomin' go!” and Roberta burst into tears.

The other man said he was blooming well blest--or something like it--but
though naturally surprised they were not exactly unkind.

“You're a naughty little gell, that's what you are,” said the fireman,
and the engine-driver said:--

“Daring little piece, I call her,” but they made her sit down on an iron
seat in the cab and told her to stop crying and tell them what she meant
by it.

She did stop, as soon as she could. One thing that helped her was the
thought that Peter would give almost his ears to be in her place--on a
real engine--really going. The children had often wondered whether any
engine-driver could be found noble enough to take them for a ride on an
engine--and now there she was. She dried her eyes and sniffed earnestly.

“Now, then,” said the fireman, “out with it. What do you mean by it,
eh?”

“Oh, please,” sniffed Bobbie.

“Try again,” said the engine-driver, encouragingly.

Bobbie tried again.

“Please, Mr. Engineer,” she said, “I did call out to you from the
line, but you didn't hear me--and I just climbed up to touch you on the
arm--quite gently I meant to do it--and then I fell into the coals--and
I am so sorry if I frightened you. Oh, don't be cross--oh, please
don't!” She sniffed again.

“We ain't so much CROSS,” said the fireman, “as interested like. It
ain't every day a little gell tumbles into our coal bunker outer the
sky, is it, Bill? What did you DO it for--eh?”

“That's the point,” agreed the engine-driver; “what did you do it FOR?”

Bobbie found that she had not quite stopped crying. The engine-driver
patted her on the back and said: “Here, cheer up, Mate. It ain't so bad
as all that 'ere, I'll be bound.”

“I wanted,” said Bobbie, much cheered to find herself addressed as
'Mate'--“I only wanted to ask you if you'd be so kind as to mend this.”
 She picked up the brown-paper parcel from among the coals and undid the
string with hot, red fingers that trembled.

Her feet and legs felt the scorch of the engine fire, but her shoulders
felt the wild chill rush of the air. The engine lurched and shook and
rattled, and as they shot under a bridge the engine seemed to shout in
her ears.

The fireman shovelled on coals.

Bobbie unrolled the brown paper and disclosed the toy engine.

“I thought,” she said wistfully, “that perhaps you'd mend this for
me--because you're an engineer, you know.”

The engine-driver said he was blowed if he wasn't blest.

“I'm blest if I ain't blowed,” remarked the fireman.

But the engine-driver took the little engine and looked at it--and the
fireman ceased for an instant to shovel coal, and looked, too.

“It's like your precious cheek,” said the engine-driver--“whatever made
you think we'd be bothered tinkering penny toys?”

“I didn't mean it for precious cheek,” said Bobbie; “only everybody that
has anything to do with railways is so kind and good, I didn't think
you'd mind. You don't really--do you?” she added, for she had seen a not
unkindly wink pass between the two.

“My trade's driving of an engine, not mending her, especially such a
hout-size in engines as this 'ere,” said Bill. “An' 'ow are we a-goin'
to get you back to your sorrowing friends and relations, and all be
forgiven and forgotten?”

“If you'll put me down next time you stop,” said Bobbie, firmly, though
her heart beat fiercely against her arm as she clasped her hands, “and
lend me the money for a third-class ticket, I'll pay you back--honour
bright. I'm not a confidence trick like in the newspapers--really, I'm
not.”

“You're a little lady, every inch,” said Bill, relenting suddenly
and completely. “We'll see you gets home safe. An' about this
engine--Jim--ain't you got ne'er a pal as can use a soldering iron?
Seems to me that's about all the little bounder wants doing to it.”

“That's what Father said,” Bobbie explained eagerly. “What's that for?”

She pointed to a little brass wheel that he had turned as he spoke.

“That's the injector.”

“In--what?”

“Injector to fill up the boiler.”

“Oh,” said Bobbie, mentally registering the fact to tell the others;
“that IS interesting.”

“This 'ere's the automatic brake,” Bill went on, flattered by her
enthusiasm. “You just move this 'ere little handle--do it with one
finger, you can--and the train jolly soon stops. That's what they call
the Power of Science in the newspapers.”

He showed her two little dials, like clock faces, and told her how one
showed how much steam was going, and the other showed if the brake was
working properly.

By the time she had seen him shut off steam with a big shining steel
handle, Bobbie knew more about the inside working of an engine than she
had ever thought there was to know, and Jim had promised that his second
cousin's wife's brother should solder the toy engine, or Jim would know
the reason why. Besides all the knowledge she had gained Bobbie felt
that she and Bill and Jim were now friends for life, and that they had
wholly and forever forgiven her for stumbling uninvited among the sacred
coals of their tender.

At Stacklepoole Junction she parted from them with warm expressions of
mutual regard. They handed her over to the guard of a returning train--a
friend of theirs--and she had the joy of knowing what guards do in their
secret fastnesses, and understood how, when you pull the communication
cord in railway carriages, a wheel goes round under the guard's nose and
a loud bell rings in his ears. She asked the guard why his van smelt
so fishy, and learned that he had to carry a lot of fish every day, and
that the wetness in the hollows of the corrugated floor had all drained
out of boxes full of plaice and cod and mackerel and soles and smelts.

Bobbie got home in time for tea, and she felt as though her mind would
burst with all that had been put into it since she parted from the
others. How she blessed the nail that had torn her frock!

“Where have you been?” asked the others.

“To the station, of course,” said Roberta. But she would not tell a word
of her adventures till the day appointed, when she mysteriously led them
to the station at the hour of the 3.19's transit, and proudly introduced
them to her friends, Bill and Jim. Jim's second cousin's wife's brother
had not been unworthy of the sacred trust reposed in him. The toy engine
was, literally, as good as new.

“Good-bye--oh, good-bye,” said Bobbie, just before the engine screamed
ITS good-bye. “I shall always, always love you--and Jim's second
cousin's wife's brother as well!”

And as the three children went home up the hill, Peter hugging the
engine, now quite its own self again, Bobbie told, with joyous leaps of
the heart, the story of how she had been an Engine-burglar.



Chapter V. Prisoners and captives.


It was one day when Mother had gone to Maidbridge. She had gone alone,
but the children were to go to the station to meet her. And, loving the
station as they did, it was only natural that they should be there a
good hour before there was any chance of Mother's train arriving, even
if the train were punctual, which was most unlikely. No doubt they would
have been just as early, even if it had been a fine day, and all the
delights of woods and fields and rocks and rivers had been open to them.
But it happened to be a very wet day and, for July, very cold. There was
a wild wind that drove flocks of dark purple clouds across the sky “like
herds of dream-elephants,” as Phyllis said. And the rain stung sharply,
so that the way to the station was finished at a run. Then the rain fell
faster and harder, and beat slantwise against the windows of the booking
office and of the chill place that had General Waiting Room on its door.

“It's like being in a besieged castle,” Phyllis said; “look at the
arrows of the foe striking against the battlements!”

“It's much more like a great garden-squirt,” said Peter.

They decided to wait on the up side, for the down platform looked very
wet indeed, and the rain was driving right into the little bleak shelter
where down-passengers have to wait for their trains.

The hour would be full of incident and of interest, for there would be
two up trains and one down to look at before the one that should bring
Mother back.

“Perhaps it'll have stopped raining by then,” said Bobbie; “anyhow, I'm
glad I brought Mother's waterproof and umbrella.”

They went into the desert spot labelled General Waiting Room, and the
time passed pleasantly enough in a game of advertisements. You know the
game, of course? It is something like dumb Crambo. The players take
it in turns to go out, and then come back and look as like some
advertisement as they can, and the others have to guess what
advertisement it is meant to be. Bobbie came in and sat down under
Mother's umbrella and made a sharp face, and everyone knew she was the
fox who sits under the umbrella in the advertisement. Phyllis tried to
make a Magic Carpet of Mother's waterproof, but it would not stand out
stiff and raft-like as a Magic Carpet should, and nobody could guess
it. Everyone thought Peter was carrying things a little too far when he
blacked his face all over with coal-dust and struck a spidery attitude
and said he was the blot that advertises somebody's Blue Black Writing
Fluid.

It was Phyllis's turn again, and she was trying to look like the Sphinx
that advertises What's-his-name's Personally Conducted Tours up the Nile
when the sharp ting of the signal announced the up train. The children
rushed out to see it pass. On its engine were the particular driver
and fireman who were now numbered among the children's dearest friends.
Courtesies passed between them. Jim asked after the toy engine, and
Bobbie pressed on his acceptance a moist, greasy package of toffee that
she had made herself.

Charmed by this attention, the engine-driver consented to consider her
request that some day he would take Peter for a ride on the engine.

“Stand back, Mates,” cried the engine-driver, suddenly, “and horf she
goes.”

And sure enough, off the train went. The children watched the
tail-lights of the train till it disappeared round the curve of the
line, and then turned to go back to the dusty freedom of the General
Waiting Room and the joys of the advertisement game.

They expected to see just one or two people, the end of the procession
of passengers who had given up their tickets and gone away. Instead, the
platform round the door of the station had a dark blot round it, and the
dark blot was a crowd of people.

“Oh!” cried Peter, with a thrill of joyous excitement, “something's
happened! Come on!”

They ran down the platform. When they got to the crowd, they could, of
course, see nothing but the damp backs and elbows of the people on the
crowd's outside. Everybody was talking at once. It was evident that
something had happened.

“It's my belief he's nothing worse than a natural,” said a
farmerish-looking person. Peter saw his red, clean-shaven face as he
spoke.

“If you ask me, I should say it was a Police Court case,” said a young
man with a black bag.

“Not it; the Infirmary more like--”

Then the voice of the Station Master was heard, firm and official:--

“Now, then--move along there. I'll attend to this, if YOU please.”

But the crowd did not move. And then came a voice that thrilled the
children through and through. For it spoke in a foreign language. And,
what is more, it was a language that they had never heard. They had
heard French spoken and German. Aunt Emma knew German, and used to sing
a song about bedeuten and zeiten and bin and sin. Nor was it Latin.
Peter had been in Latin for four terms.

It was some comfort, anyhow, to find that none of the crowd understood
the foreign language any better than the children did.

“What's that he's saying?” asked the farmer, heavily.

“Sounds like French to me,” said the Station Master, who had once been
to Boulogne for the day.

“It isn't French!” cried Peter.

“What is it, then?” asked more than one voice. The crowd fell back a
little to see who had spoken, and Peter pressed forward, so that when
the crowd closed up again he was in the front rank.

“I don't know what it is,” said Peter, “but it isn't French. I know
that.” Then he saw what it was that the crowd had for its centre. It
was a man--the man, Peter did not doubt, who had spoken in that strange
tongue. A man with long hair and wild eyes, with shabby clothes of a cut
Peter had not seen before--a man whose hands and lips trembled, and who
spoke again as his eyes fell on Peter.

“No, it's not French,” said Peter.

“Try him with French if you know so much about it,” said the farmer-man.

“Parlay voo Frongsay?” began Peter, boldly, and the next moment the
crowd recoiled again, for the man with the wild eyes had left leaning
against the wall, and had sprung forward and caught Peter's hands,
and begun to pour forth a flood of words which, though he could not
understand a word of them, Peter knew the sound of.

“There!” said he, and turned, his hands still clasped in the hands of
the strange shabby figure, to throw a glance of triumph at the crowd;
“there; THAT'S French.”

“What does he say?”

“I don't know.” Peter was obliged to own it.

“Here,” said the Station Master again; “you move on if you please. I'LL
deal with this case.”

A few of the more timid or less inquisitive travellers moved slowly and
reluctantly away. And Phyllis and Bobbie got near to Peter. All three
had been TAUGHT French at school. How deeply they now wished that they
had LEARNED it! Peter shook his head at the stranger, but he also shook
his hands as warmly and looked at him as kindly as he could. A person
in the crowd, after some hesitation, said suddenly, “No comprenny!” and
then, blushing deeply, backed out of the press and went away.

“Take him into your room,” whispered Bobbie to the Station Master.
“Mother can talk French. She'll be here by the next train from
Maidbridge.”

The Station Master took the arm of the stranger, suddenly but not
unkindly. But the man wrenched his arm away, and cowered back coughing
and trembling and trying to push the Station Master away.

“Oh, don't!” said Bobbie; “don't you see how frightened he is? He thinks
you're going to shut him up. I know he does--look at his eyes!”

“They're like a fox's eyes when the beast's in a trap,” said the farmer.

“Oh, let me try!” Bobbie went on; “I do really know one or two French
words if I could only think of them.”

Sometimes, in moments of great need, we can do wonderful things--things
that in ordinary life we could hardly even dream of doing. Bobbie had
never been anywhere near the top of her French class, but she must have
learned something without knowing it, for now, looking at those wild,
hunted eyes, she actually remembered and, what is more, spoke, some
French words. She said:--

“Vous attendre. Ma mere parlez Francais. Nous--what's the French for
'being kind'?”

Nobody knew.

“Bong is 'good,'” said Phyllis.

“Nous etre bong pour vous.”

I do not know whether the man understood her words, but he understood
the touch of the hand she thrust into his, and the kindness of the other
hand that stroked his shabby sleeve.

She pulled him gently towards the inmost sanctuary of the Station
Master. The other children followed, and the Station Master shut the
door in the face of the crowd, which stood a little while in the booking
office talking and looking at the fast closed yellow door, and then by
ones and twos went its way, grumbling.

Inside the Station Master's room Bobbie still held the stranger's hand
and stroked his sleeve.

“Here's a go,” said the Station Master; “no ticket--doesn't even know
where he wants to go. I'm not sure now but what I ought to send for the
police.”

“Oh, DON'T!” all the children pleaded at once. And suddenly Bobbie
got between the others and the stranger, for she had seen that he was
crying.

By a most unusual piece of good fortune she had a handkerchief in
her pocket. By a still more uncommon accident the handkerchief was
moderately clean. Standing in front of the stranger, she got out the
handkerchief and passed it to him so that the others did not see.

“Wait till Mother comes,” Phyllis was saying; “she does speak French
beautifully. You'd just love to hear her.”

“I'm sure he hasn't done anything like you're sent to prison for,” said
Peter.

“Looks like without visible means to me,” said the Station Master.
“Well, I don't mind giving him the benefit of the doubt till your Mamma
comes. I SHOULD like to know what nation's got the credit of HIM, that I
should.”

Then Peter had an idea. He pulled an envelope out of his pocket, and
showed that it was half full of foreign stamps.

“Look here,” he said, “let's show him these--”

Bobbie looked and saw that the stranger had dried his eyes with her
handkerchief. So she said: “All right.”

They showed him an Italian stamp, and pointed from him to it and back
again, and made signs of question with their eyebrows. He shook his
head. Then they showed him a Norwegian stamp--the common blue kind it
was--and again he signed No. Then they showed him a Spanish one, and
at that he took the envelope from Peter's hand and searched among the
stamps with a hand that trembled. The hand that he reached out at last,
with a gesture as of one answering a question, contained a RUSSIAN
stamp.

“He's Russian,” cried Peter, “or else he's like 'the man who was'--in
Kipling, you know.”

The train from Maidbridge was signalled.

“I'll stay with him till you bring Mother in,” said Bobbie.

“You're not afraid, Missie?”

“Oh, no,” said Bobbie, looking at the stranger, as she might have looked
at a strange dog of doubtful temper. “You wouldn't hurt me, would you?”

She smiled at him, and he smiled back, a queer crooked smile. And then
he coughed again. And the heavy rattling swish of the incoming train
swept past, and the Station Master and Peter and Phyllis went out to
meet it. Bobbie was still holding the stranger's hand when they came
back with Mother.

The Russian rose and bowed very ceremoniously.

Then Mother spoke in French, and he replied, haltingly at first, but
presently in longer and longer sentences.

The children, watching his face and Mother's, knew that he was telling
her things that made her angry and pitying, and sorry and indignant all
at once.

“Well, Mum, what's it all about?” The Station Master could not restrain
his curiosity any longer.

“Oh,” said Mother, “it's all right. He's a Russian, and he's lost his
ticket. And I'm afraid he's very ill. If you don't mind, I'll take him
home with me now. He's really quite worn out. I'll run down and tell you
all about him to-morrow.”

“I hope you won't find you're taking home a frozen viper,” said the
Station Master, doubtfully.

“Oh, no,” Mother said brightly, and she smiled; “I'm quite sure I'm
not. Why, he's a great man in his own country, writes books--beautiful
books--I've read some of them; but I'll tell you all about it
to-morrow.”

She spoke again in French to the Russian, and everyone could see the
surprise and pleasure and gratitude in his eyes. He got up and politely
bowed to the Station Master, and offered his arm most ceremoniously to
Mother. She took it, but anybody could have seen that she was helping
him along, and not he her.

“You girls run home and light a fire in the sitting-room,” Mother said,
“and Peter had better go for the Doctor.”

But it was Bobbie who went for the Doctor.

“I hate to tell you,” she said breathlessly when she came upon him
in his shirt sleeves, weeding his pansy-bed, “but Mother's got a very
shabby Russian, and I'm sure he'll have to belong to your Club. I'm
certain he hasn't got any money. We found him at the station.”

“Found him! Was he lost, then?” asked the Doctor, reaching for his coat.

“Yes,” said Bobbie, unexpectedly, “that's just what he was. He's been
telling Mother the sad, sweet story of his life in French; and she said
would you be kind enough to come directly if you were at home. He has a
dreadful cough, and he's been crying.”

The Doctor smiled.

“Oh, don't,” said Bobbie; “please don't. You wouldn't if you'd seen him.
I never saw a man cry before. You don't know what it's like.”

Dr. Forrest wished then that he hadn't smiled.

When Bobbie and the Doctor got to Three Chimneys, the Russian was
sitting in the arm-chair that had been Father's, stretching his feet
to the blaze of a bright wood fire, and sipping the tea Mother had made
him.

“The man seems worn out, mind and body,” was what the Doctor said; “the
cough's bad, but there's nothing that can't be cured. He ought to go
straight to bed, though--and let him have a fire at night.”

“I'll make one in my room; it's the only one with a fireplace,” said
Mother. She did, and presently the Doctor helped the stranger to bed.

There was a big black trunk in Mother's room that none of the children
had ever seen unlocked. Now, when she had lighted the fire, she unlocked
it and took some clothes out--men's clothes--and set them to air by the
newly lighted fire. Bobbie, coming in with more wood for the fire, saw
the mark on the night-shirt, and looked over to the open trunk. All
the things she could see were men's clothes. And the name marked on the
shirt was Father's name. Then Father hadn't taken his clothes with him.
And that night-shirt was one of Father's new ones. Bobbie remembered its
being made, just before Peter's birthday. Why hadn't Father taken his
clothes? Bobbie slipped from the room. As she went she heard the key
turned in the lock of the trunk. Her heart was beating horribly. WHY
hadn't Father taken his clothes? When Mother came out of the room,
Bobbie flung tightly clasping arms round her waist, and whispered:--

“Mother--Daddy isn't--isn't DEAD, is he?”

“My darling, no! What made you think of anything so horrible?”

“I--I don't know,” said Bobbie, angry with herself, but still clinging
to that resolution of hers, not to see anything that Mother didn't mean
her to see.

Mother gave her a hurried hug. “Daddy was quite, QUITE well when I heard
from him last,” she said, “and he'll come back to us some day. Don't
fancy such horrible things, darling!”

Later on, when the Russian stranger had been made comfortable for the
night, Mother came into the girls' room. She was to sleep there in
Phyllis's bed, and Phyllis was to have a mattress on the floor, a
most amusing adventure for Phyllis. Directly Mother came in, two white
figures started up, and two eager voices called:--

“Now, Mother, tell us all about the Russian gentleman.”

A white shape hopped into the room. It was Peter, dragging his quilt
behind him like the tail of a white peacock.

“We have been patient,” he said, “and I had to bite my tongue not to
go to sleep, and I just nearly went to sleep and I bit too hard, and it
hurts ever so. DO tell us. Make a nice long story of it.”

“I can't make a long story of it to-night,” said Mother; “I'm very
tired.”

Bobbie knew by her voice that Mother had been crying, but the others
didn't know.

“Well, make it as long as you can,” said Phil, and Bobbie got her arms
round Mother's waist and snuggled close to her.

“Well, it's a story long enough to make a whole book of. He's a writer;
he's written beautiful books. In Russia at the time of the Czar one
dared not say anything about the rich people doing wrong, or about the
things that ought to be done to make poor people better and happier. If
one did one was sent to prison.”

“But they CAN'T,” said Peter; “people only go to prison when they've
done wrong.”

“Or when the Judges THINK they've done wrong,” said Mother. “Yes, that's
so in England. But in Russia it was different. And he wrote a beautiful
book about poor people and how to help them. I've read it. There's
nothing in it but goodness and kindness. And they sent him to prison for
it. He was three years in a horrible dungeon, with hardly any light, and
all damp and dreadful. In prison all alone for three years.”

Mother's voice trembled a little and stopped suddenly.

“But, Mother,” said Peter, “that can't be true NOW. It sounds like
something out of a history book--the Inquisition, or something.”

“It WAS true,” said Mother; “it's all horribly true. Well, then they
took him out and sent him to Siberia, a convict chained to other
convicts--wicked men who'd done all sorts of crimes--a long chain of
them, and they walked, and walked, and walked, for days and weeks, till
he thought they'd never stop walking. And overseers went behind them
with whips--yes, whips--to beat them if they got tired. And some of them
went lame, and some fell down, and when they couldn't get up and go on,
they beat them, and then left them to die. Oh, it's all too terrible!
And at last he got to the mines, and he was condemned to stay there for
life--for life, just for writing a good, noble, splendid book.”

“How did he get away?”

“When the war came, some of the Russian prisoners were allowed to
volunteer as soldiers. And he volunteered. But he deserted at the first
chance he got and--”

“But that's very cowardly, isn't it”--said Peter--“to desert? Especially
when it's war.”

“Do you think he owed anything to a country that had done THAT to him?
If he did, he owed more to his wife and children. He didn't know what
had become of them.”

“Oh,” cried Bobbie, “he had THEM to think about and be miserable about
TOO, then, all the time he was in prison?”

“Yes, he had them to think about and be miserable about all the time he
was in prison. For anything he knew they might have been sent to prison,
too. They did those things in Russia. But while he was in the mines some
friends managed to get a message to him that his wife and children had
escaped and come to England. So when he deserted he came here to look
for them.”

“Had he got their address?” said practical Peter.

“No; just England. He was going to London, and he thought he had to
change at our station, and then he found he'd lost his ticket and his
purse.”

“Oh, DO you think he'll find them?--I mean his wife and children, not
the ticket and things.”

“I hope so. Oh, I hope and pray that he'll find his wife and children
again.”

Even Phyllis now perceived that mother's voice was very unsteady.

“Why, Mother,” she said, “how very sorry you seem to be for him!”

Mother didn't answer for a minute. Then she just said, “Yes,” and then
she seemed to be thinking. The children were quiet.

Presently she said, “Dears, when you say your prayers, I think you might
ask God to show His pity upon all prisoners and captives.”

“To show His pity,” Bobbie repeated slowly, “upon all prisoners and
captives. Is that right, Mother?”

“Yes,” said Mother, “upon all prisoners and captives. All prisoners and
captives.”



Chapter VI. Saviours of the train.


The Russian gentleman was better the next day, and the day after that
better still, and on the third day he was well enough to come into the
garden. A basket chair was put for him and he sat there, dressed in
clothes of Father's which were too big for him. But when Mother had
hemmed up the ends of the sleeves and the trousers, the clothes did
well enough. His was a kind face now that it was no longer tired and
frightened, and he smiled at the children whenever he saw them. They
wished very much that he could speak English. Mother wrote several
letters to people she thought might know whereabouts in England a
Russian gentleman's wife and family might possibly be; not to the people
she used to know before she came to live at Three Chimneys--she never
wrote to any of them--but strange people--Members of Parliament and
Editors of papers, and Secretaries of Societies.

And she did not do much of her story-writing, only corrected proofs as
she sat in the sun near the Russian, and talked to him every now and
then.

The children wanted very much to show how kindly they felt to this man
who had been sent to prison and to Siberia just for writing a beautiful
book about poor people. They could smile at him, of course; they could
and they did. But if you smile too constantly, the smile is apt to
get fixed like the smile of the hyaena. And then it no longer looks
friendly, but simply silly. So they tried other ways, and brought him
flowers till the place where he sat was surrounded by little fading
bunches of clover and roses and Canterbury bells.

And then Phyllis had an idea. She beckoned mysteriously to the others
and drew them into the back yard, and there, in a concealed spot,
between the pump and the water-butt, she said:--

“You remember Perks promising me the very first strawberries out of his
own garden?” Perks, you will recollect, was the Porter. “Well, I should
think they're ripe now. Let's go down and see.”

Mother had been down as she had promised to tell the Station Master the
story of the Russian Prisoner. But even the charms of the railway had
been unable to tear the children away from the neighbourhood of the
interesting stranger. So they had not been to the station for three
days.

They went now.

And, to their surprise and distress, were very coldly received by Perks.

“'Ighly honoured, I'm sure,” he said when they peeped in at the door of
the Porters' room. And he went on reading his newspaper.

There was an uncomfortable silence.

“Oh, dear,” said Bobbie, with a sigh, “I do believe you're CROSS.”

“What, me? Not me!” said Perks loftily; “it ain't nothing to me.”

“What AIN'T nothing to you?” said Peter, too anxious and alarmed to
change the form of words.

“Nothing ain't nothing. What 'appens either 'ere or elsewhere,” said
Perks; “if you likes to 'ave your secrets, 'ave 'em and welcome. That's
what I say.”

The secret-chamber of each heart was rapidly examined during the pause
that followed. Three heads were shaken.

“We haven't got any secrets from YOU,” said Bobbie at last.

“Maybe you 'ave, and maybe you 'aven't,” said Perks; “it ain't nothing
to me. And I wish you all a very good afternoon.” He held up the paper
between him and them and went on reading.

“Oh, DON'T!” said Phyllis, in despair; “this is truly dreadful! Whatever
it is, do tell us.”

“We didn't mean to do it whatever it was.”

No answer. The paper was refolded and Perks began on another column.

“Look here,” said Peter, suddenly, “it's not fair. Even people who do
crimes aren't punished without being told what it's for--as once they
were in Russia.”

“I don't know nothing about Russia.”

“Oh, yes, you do, when Mother came down on purpose to tell you and Mr.
Gills all about OUR Russian.”

“Can't you fancy it?” said Perks, indignantly; “don't you see 'im
a-asking of me to step into 'is room and take a chair and listen to what
'er Ladyship 'as to say?”

“Do you mean to say you've not heard?”

“Not so much as a breath. I did go so far as to put a question. And he
shuts me up like a rat-trap. 'Affairs of State, Perks,' says he. But I
did think one o' you would 'a' nipped down to tell me--you're here sharp
enough when you want to get anything out of old Perks”--Phyllis
flushed purple as she thought of the strawberries--“information about
locomotives or signals or the likes,” said Perks.

“We didn't know you didn't know.”

“We thought Mother had told you.”

“Wewantedtotellyouonlywethoughtitwouldbestalenews.”

The three spoke all at once.

Perks said it was all very well, and still held up the paper. Then
Phyllis suddenly snatched it away, and threw her arms round his neck.

“Oh, let's kiss and be friends,” she said; “we'll say we're sorry first,
if you like, but we didn't really know that you didn't know.”

“We are so sorry,” said the others.

And Perks at last consented to accept their apologies.

Then they got him to come out and sit in the sun on the green Railway
Bank, where the grass was quite hot to touch, and there, sometimes
speaking one at a time, and sometimes all together, they told the Porter
the story of the Russian Prisoner.

“Well, I must say,” said Perks; but he did not say it--whatever it was.

“Yes, it is pretty awful, isn't it?” said Peter, “and I don't wonder you
were curious about who the Russian was.”

“I wasn't curious, not so much as interested,” said the Porter.

“Well, I do think Mr. Gills might have told you about it. It was horrid
of him.”

“I don't keep no down on 'im for that, Missie,” said the Porter; “cos
why? I see 'is reasons. 'E wouldn't want to give away 'is own side with
a tale like that 'ere. It ain't human nature. A man's got to stand
up for his own side whatever they does. That's what it means by Party
Politics. I should 'a' done the same myself if that long-'aired chap 'ad
'a' been a Jap.”

“But the Japs didn't do cruel, wicked things like that,” said Bobbie.

“P'r'aps not,” said Perks, cautiously; “still you can't be sure with
foreigners. My own belief is they're all tarred with the same brush.”

“Then why were you on the side of the Japs?” Peter asked.

“Well, you see, you must take one side or the other. Same as with
Liberals and Conservatives. The great thing is to take your side and
then stick to it, whatever happens.”

A signal sounded.

“There's the 3.14 up,” said Perks. “You lie low till she's through,
and then we'll go up along to my place, and see if there's any of them
strawberries ripe what I told you about.”

“If there are any ripe, and you DO give them to me,” said Phyllis, “you
won't mind if I give them to the poor Russian, will you?”

Perks narrowed his eyes and then raised his eyebrows.

“So it was them strawberries you come down for this afternoon, eh?” said
he.

This was an awkward moment for Phyllis. To say “yes” would seem rude and
greedy, and unkind to Perks. But she knew if she said “no,” she would
not be pleased with herself afterwards. So--

“Yes,” she said, “it was.”

“Well done!” said the Porter; “speak the truth and shame the--”

“But we'd have come down the very next day if we'd known you hadn't
heard the story,” Phyllis added hastily.

“I believe you, Missie,” said Perks, and sprang across the line six feet
in front of the advancing train.

The girls hated to see him do this, but Peter liked it. It was so
exciting.

The Russian gentleman was so delighted with the strawberries that the
three racked their brains to find some other surprise for him. But all
the racking did not bring out any idea more novel than wild cherries.
And this idea occurred to them next morning. They had seen the blossom
on the trees in the spring, and they knew where to look for wild
cherries now that cherry time was here. The trees grew all up and along
the rocky face of the cliff out of which the mouth of the tunnel opened.
There were all sorts of trees there, birches and beeches and baby oaks
and hazels, and among them the cherry blossom had shone like snow and
silver.

The mouth of the tunnel was some way from Three Chimneys, so Mother let
them take their lunch with them in a basket. And the basket would do
to bring the cherries back in if they found any. She also lent them her
silver watch so that they should not be late for tea. Peter's Waterbury
had taken it into its head not to go since the day when Peter dropped it
into the water-butt. And they started. When they got to the top of the
cutting, they leaned over the fence and looked down to where the railway
lines lay at the bottom of what, as Phyllis said, was exactly like a
mountain gorge.

“If it wasn't for the railway at the bottom, it would be as though the
foot of man had never been there, wouldn't it?”

The sides of the cutting were of grey stone, very roughly hewn. Indeed,
the top part of the cutting had been a little natural glen that had been
cut deeper to bring it down to the level of the tunnel's mouth. Among
the rocks, grass and flowers grew, and seeds dropped by birds in the
crannies of the stone had taken root and grown into bushes and trees
that overhung the cutting. Near the tunnel was a flight of steps leading
down to the line--just wooden bars roughly fixed into the earth--a very
steep and narrow way, more like a ladder than a stair.

“We'd better get down,” said Peter; “I'm sure the cherries would be
quite easy to get at from the side of the steps. You remember it was
there we picked the cherry blossoms that we put on the rabbit's grave.”

So they went along the fence towards the little swing gate that is at
the top of these steps. And they were almost at the gate when Bobbie
said:--

“Hush. Stop! What's that?”

“That” was a very odd noise indeed--a soft noise, but quite plainly to
be heard through the sound of the wind in tree branches, and the hum
and whir of the telegraph wires. It was a sort of rustling, whispering
sound. As they listened it stopped, and then it began again.

And this time it did not stop, but it grew louder and more rustling and
rumbling.

“Look”--cried Peter, suddenly--“the tree over there!”

The tree he pointed at was one of those that have rough grey leaves and
white flowers. The berries, when they come, are bright scarlet, but if
you pick them, they disappoint you by turning black before you get them
home. And, as Peter pointed, the tree was moving--not just the way trees
ought to move when the wind blows through them, but all in one piece,
as though it were a live creature and were walking down the side of the
cutting.

“It's moving!” cried Bobbie. “Oh, look! and so are the others. It's like
the woods in Macbeth.”

“It's magic,” said Phyllis, breathlessly. “I always knew this railway
was enchanted.”

It really did seem a little like magic. For all the trees for about
twenty yards of the opposite bank seemed to be slowly walking down
towards the railway line, the tree with the grey leaves bringing up the
rear like some old shepherd driving a flock of green sheep.

“What is it? Oh, what is it?” said Phyllis; “it's much too magic for me.
I don't like it. Let's go home.”

But Bobbie and Peter clung fast to the rail and watched breathlessly.
And Phyllis made no movement towards going home by herself.

The trees moved on and on. Some stones and loose earth fell down and
rattled on the railway metals far below.

“It's ALL coming down,” Peter tried to say, but he found there was
hardly any voice to say it with. And, indeed, just as he spoke, the
great rock, on the top of which the walking trees were, leaned slowly
forward. The trees, ceasing to walk, stood still and shivered. Leaning
with the rock, they seemed to hesitate a moment, and then rock and trees
and grass and bushes, with a rushing sound, slipped right away from the
face of the cutting and fell on the line with a blundering crash that
could have been heard half a mile off. A cloud of dust rose up.

“Oh,” said Peter, in awestruck tones, “isn't it exactly like when coals
come in?--if there wasn't any roof to the cellar and you could see
down.”

“Look what a great mound it's made!” said Bobbie.

“Yes,” said Peter, slowly. He was still leaning on the fence. “Yes,” he
said again, still more slowly.

Then he stood upright.

“The 11.29 down hasn't gone by yet. We must let them know at the
station, or there'll be a most frightful accident.”

“Let's run,” said Bobbie, and began.

But Peter cried, “Come back!” and looked at Mother's watch. He was very
prompt and businesslike, and his face looked whiter than they had ever
seen it.

“No time,” he said; “it's two miles away, and it's past eleven.”

“Couldn't we,” suggested Phyllis, breathlessly, “couldn't we climb up a
telegraph post and do something to the wires?”

“We don't know how,” said Peter.

“They do it in war,” said Phyllis; “I know I've heard of it.”

“They only CUT them, silly,” said Peter, “and that doesn't do any good.
And we couldn't cut them even if we got up, and we couldn't get up. If
we had anything red, we could get down on the line and wave it.”

“But the train wouldn't see us till it got round the corner, and then it
could see the mound just as well as us,” said Phyllis; “better, because
it's much bigger than us.”

“If we only had something red,” Peter repeated, “we could go round the
corner and wave to the train.”

“We might wave, anyway.”

“They'd only think it was just US, as usual. We've waved so often
before. Anyway, let's get down.”

They got down the steep stairs. Bobbie was pale and shivering. Peter's
face looked thinner than usual. Phyllis was red-faced and damp with
anxiety.

“Oh, how hot I am!” she said; “and I thought it was going to be cold; I
wish we hadn't put on our--” she stopped short, and then ended in quite
a different tone--“our flannel petticoats.”

Bobbie turned at the bottom of the stairs.

“Oh, yes,” she cried; “THEY'RE red! Let's take them off.”

They did, and with the petticoats rolled up under their arms, ran along
the railway, skirting the newly fallen mound of stones and rock and
earth, and bent, crushed, twisted trees. They ran at their best pace.
Peter led, but the girls were not far behind. They reached the corner
that hid the mound from the straight line of railway that ran half a
mile without curve or corner.

“Now,” said Peter, taking hold of the largest flannel petticoat.

“You're not”--Phyllis faltered--“you're not going to TEAR them?”

“Shut up,” said Peter, with brief sternness.

“Oh, yes,” said Bobbie, “tear them into little bits if you like. Don't
you see, Phil, if we can't stop the train, there'll be a real live
accident, with people KILLED. Oh, horrible! Here, Peter, you'll never
tear it through the band!”

She took the red flannel petticoat from him and tore it off an inch from
the band. Then she tore the other in the same way.

“There!” said Peter, tearing in his turn. He divided each petticoat into
three pieces. “Now, we've got six flags.” He looked at the watch again.
“And we've got seven minutes. We must have flagstaffs.”

The knives given to boys are, for some odd reason, seldom of the kind
of steel that keeps sharp. The young saplings had to be broken off. Two
came up by the roots. The leaves were stripped from them.

“We must cut holes in the flags, and run the sticks through the holes,”
 said Peter. And the holes were cut. The knife was sharp enough to cut
flannel with. Two of the flags were set up in heaps of loose stones
between the sleepers of the down line. Then Phyllis and Roberta took
each a flag, and stood ready to wave it as soon as the train came in
sight.

“I shall have the other two myself,” said Peter, “because it was my idea
to wave something red.”

“They're our petticoats, though,” Phyllis was beginning, but Bobbie
interrupted--

“Oh, what does it matter who waves what, if we can only save the train?”

Perhaps Peter had not rightly calculated the number of minutes it would
take the 11.29 to get from the station to the place where they were, or
perhaps the train was late. Anyway, it seemed a very long time that they
waited.

Phyllis grew impatient. “I expect the watch is wrong, and the train's
gone by,” said she.

Peter relaxed the heroic attitude he had chosen to show off his two
flags. And Bobbie began to feel sick with suspense.

It seemed to her that they had been standing there for hours and hours,
holding those silly little red flannel flags that no one would ever
notice. The train wouldn't care. It would go rushing by them and tear
round the corner and go crashing into that awful mound. And everyone
would be killed. Her hands grew very cold and trembled so that she could
hardly hold the flag. And then came the distant rumble and hum of the
metals, and a puff of white steam showed far away along the stretch of
line.

“Stand firm,” said Peter, “and wave like mad! When it gets to that
big furze bush step back, but go on waving! Don't stand ON the line,
Bobbie!”

The train came rattling along very, very fast.

“They don't see us! They won't see us! It's all no good!” cried Bobbie.

The two little flags on the line swayed as the nearing train shook and
loosened the heaps of loose stones that held them up. One of them slowly
leaned over and fell on the line. Bobbie jumped forward and caught it
up, and waved it; her hands did not tremble now.

It seemed that the train came on as fast as ever. It was very near now.

“Keep off the line, you silly cuckoo!” said Peter, fiercely.

“It's no good,” Bobbie said again.

“Stand back!” cried Peter, suddenly, and he dragged Phyllis back by the
arm.

But Bobbie cried, “Not yet, not yet!” and waved her two flags right over
the line. The front of the engine looked black and enormous. Its voice
was loud and harsh.

“Oh, stop, stop, stop!” cried Bobbie. No one heard her. At least Peter
and Phyllis didn't, for the oncoming rush of the train covered the sound
of her voice with a mountain of sound. But afterwards she used to wonder
whether the engine itself had not heard her. It seemed almost as though
it had--for it slackened swiftly, slackened and stopped, not twenty
yards from the place where Bobbie's two flags waved over the line. She
saw the great black engine stop dead, but somehow she could not stop
waving the flags. And when the driver and the fireman had got off the
engine and Peter and Phyllis had gone to meet them and pour out their
excited tale of the awful mound just round the corner, Bobbie still
waved the flags but more and more feebly and jerkily.

When the others turned towards her she was lying across the line with
her hands flung forward and still gripping the sticks of the little red
flannel flags.

The engine-driver picked her up, carried her to the train, and laid her
on the cushions of a first-class carriage.

“Gone right off in a faint,” he said, “poor little woman. And no wonder.
I'll just 'ave a look at this 'ere mound of yours, and then we'll run
you back to the station and get her seen to.”

It was horrible to see Bobbie lying so white and quiet, with her lips
blue, and parted.

“I believe that's what people look like when they're dead,” whispered
Phyllis.

“DON'T!” said Peter, sharply.

They sat by Bobbie on the blue cushions, and the train ran back. Before
it reached their station Bobbie had sighed and opened her eyes,
and rolled herself over and begun to cry. This cheered the others
wonderfully. They had seen her cry before, but they had never seen her
faint, nor anyone else, for the matter of that. They had not known what
to do when she was fainting, but now she was only crying they could
thump her on the back and tell her not to, just as they always did. And
presently, when she stopped crying, they were able to laugh at her for
being such a coward as to faint.

When the station was reached, the three were the heroes of an agitated
meeting on the platform.

The praises they got for their “prompt action,” their “common sense,”
 their “ingenuity,” were enough to have turned anybody's head. Phyllis
enjoyed herself thoroughly. She had never been a real heroine before,
and the feeling was delicious. Peter's ears got very red. Yet he, too,
enjoyed himself. Only Bobbie wished they all wouldn't. She wanted to get
away.

“You'll hear from the Company about this, I expect,” said the Station
Master.

Bobbie wished she might never hear of it again. She pulled at Peter's
jacket.

“Oh, come away, come away! I want to go home,” she said.

So they went. And as they went Station Master and Porter and guards and
driver and fireman and passengers sent up a cheer.

“Oh, listen,” cried Phyllis; “that's for US!”

“Yes,” said Peter. “I say, I am glad I thought about something red, and
waving it.”

“How lucky we DID put on our red flannel petticoats!” said Phyllis.

Bobbie said nothing. She was thinking of the horrible mound, and the
trustful train rushing towards it.

“And it was US that saved them,” said Peter.

“How dreadful if they had all been killed!” said Phyllis; “wouldn't it,
Bobbie?”

“We never got any cherries, after all,” said Bobbie.

The others thought her rather heartless.



Chapter VII. For valour.


I hope you don't mind my telling you a good deal about Roberta. The fact
is I am growing very fond of her. The more I observe her the more I love
her. And I notice all sorts of things about her that I like.

For instance, she was quite oddly anxious to make other people happy.
And she could keep a secret, a tolerably rare accomplishment. Also she
had the power of silent sympathy. That sounds rather dull, I know, but
it's not so dull as it sounds. It just means that a person is able
to know that you are unhappy, and to love you extra on that account,
without bothering you by telling you all the time how sorry she is
for you. That was what Bobbie was like. She knew that Mother was
unhappy--and that Mother had not told her the reason. So she just loved
Mother more and never said a single word that could let Mother know how
earnestly her little girl wondered what Mother was unhappy about. This
needs practice. It is not so easy as you might think.

Whatever happened--and all sorts of nice, pleasant ordinary things
happened--such as picnics, games, and buns for tea, Bobbie always had
these thoughts at the back of her mind. “Mother's unhappy. Why? I don't
know. She doesn't want me to know. I won't try to find out. But she
IS unhappy. Why? I don't know. She doesn't--” and so on, repeating and
repeating like a tune that you don't know the stopping part of.

The Russian gentleman still took up a good deal of everybody's thoughts.
All the editors and secretaries of Societies and Members of Parliament
had answered Mother's letters as politely as they knew how; but none of
them could tell where the wife and children of Mr. Szezcpansky would be
likely to be. (Did I tell you that the Russian's very Russian name was
that?)

Bobbie had another quality which you will hear differently described
by different people. Some of them call it interfering in other people's
business--and some call it “helping lame dogs over stiles,” and some
call it “loving-kindness.” It just means trying to help people.

She racked her brains to think of some way of helping the Russian
gentleman to find his wife and children. He had learned a few words
of English now. He could say “Good morning,” and “Good night,” and
“Please,” and “Thank you,” and “Pretty,” when the children brought him
flowers, and “Ver' good,” when they asked him how he had slept.

The way he smiled when he “said his English,” was, Bobbie felt, “just
too sweet for anything.” She used to think of his face because she
fancied it would help her to some way of helping him. But it did not.
Yet his being there cheered her because she saw that it made Mother
happier.

“She likes to have someone to be good to, even beside us,” said Bobbie.
“And I know she hated to let him have Father's clothes. But I suppose it
'hurt nice,' or she wouldn't have.”

For many and many a night after the day when she and Peter and Phyllis
had saved the train from wreck by waving their little red flannel flags,
Bobbie used to wake screaming and shivering, seeing again that horrible
mound, and the poor, dear trustful engine rushing on towards it--just
thinking that it was doing its swift duty, and that everything was clear
and safe. And then a warm thrill of pleasure used to run through her
at the remembrance of how she and Peter and Phyllis and the red flannel
petticoats had really saved everybody.

One morning a letter came. It was addressed to Peter and Bobbie and
Phyllis. They opened it with enthusiastic curiosity, for they did not
often get letters.

The letter said:--

“Dear Sir, and Ladies,--It is proposed to make a small presentation to
you, in commemoration of your prompt and courageous action in warning
the train on the --- inst., and thus averting what must, humanly
speaking, have been a terrible accident. The presentation will take
place at the --- Station at three o'clock on the 30th inst., if this
time and place will be convenient to you.

          “Yours faithfully,

                    “Jabez Inglewood.
“Secretary, Great Northern and Southern Railway Co.”

There never had been a prouder moment in the lives of the three
children. They rushed to Mother with the letter, and she also felt proud
and said so, and this made the children happier than ever.

“But if the presentation is money, you must say, 'Thank you, but we'd
rather not take it,'” said Mother. “I'll wash your Indian muslins at
once,” she added. “You must look tidy on an occasion like this.”

“Phil and I can wash them,” said Bobbie, “if you'll iron them, Mother.”

Washing is rather fun. I wonder whether you've ever done it? This
particular washing took place in the back kitchen, which had a stone
floor and a very big stone sink under its window.

“Let's put the bath on the sink,” said Phyllis; “then we can pretend
we're out-of-doors washerwomen like Mother saw in France.”

“But they were washing in the cold river,” said Peter, his hands in his
pockets, “not in hot water.”

“This is a HOT river, then,” said Phyllis; “lend a hand with the bath,
there's a dear.”

“I should like to see a deer lending a hand,” said Peter, but he lent
his.

“Now to rub and scrub and scrub and rub,” said Phyllis, hopping joyously
about as Bobbie carefully carried the heavy kettle from the kitchen
fire.

“Oh, no!” said Bobbie, greatly shocked; “you don't rub muslin. You put
the boiled soap in the hot water and make it all frothy-lathery--and
then you shake the muslin and squeeze it, ever so gently, and all the
dirt comes out. It's only clumsy things like tablecloths and sheets that
have to be rubbed.”

The lilac and the Gloire de Dijon roses outside the window swayed in the
soft breeze.

“It's a nice drying day--that's one thing,” said Bobbie, feeling very
grown up. “Oh, I do wonder what wonderful feelings we shall have when we
WEAR the Indian muslin dresses!”

“Yes, so do I,” said Phyllis, shaking and squeezing the muslin in quite
a professional manner.

“NOW we squeeze out the soapy water. NO--we mustn't twist them--and then
rinse them. I'll hold them while you and Peter empty the bath and get
clean water.”

“A presentation! That means presents,” said Peter, as his sisters,
having duly washed the pegs and wiped the line, hung up the dresses to
dry. “Whatever will it be?”

“It might be anything,” said Phyllis; “what I've always wanted is a Baby
elephant--but I suppose they wouldn't know that.”

“Suppose it was gold models of steam-engines?” said Bobbie.

“Or a big model of the scene of the prevented accident,” suggested
Peter, “with a little model train, and dolls dressed like us and the
engine-driver and fireman and passengers.”

“Do you LIKE,” said Bobbie, doubtfully, drying her hands on the rough
towel that hung on a roller at the back of the scullery door, “do you
LIKE us being rewarded for saving a train?”

“Yes, I do,” said Peter, downrightly; “and don't you try to come it over
us that you don't like it, too. Because I know you do.”

“Yes,” said Bobbie, doubtfully, “I know I do. But oughtn't we to be
satisfied with just having done it, and not ask for anything more?”

“Who did ask for anything more, silly?” said her brother; “Victoria
Cross soldiers don't ASK for it; but they're glad enough to get it all
the same. Perhaps it'll be medals. Then, when I'm very old indeed, I
shall show them to my grandchildren and say, 'We only did our duty,' and
they'll be awfully proud of me.”

“You have to be married,” warned Phyllis, “or you don't have any
grandchildren.”

“I suppose I shall HAVE to be married some day,” said Peter, “but it
will be an awful bother having her round all the time. I'd like to marry
a lady who had trances, and only woke up once or twice a year.”

“Just to say you were the light of her life and then go to sleep again.
Yes. That wouldn't be bad,” said Bobbie.

“When _I_ get married,” said Phyllis, “I shall want him to want me to be
awake all the time, so that I can hear him say how nice I am.”

“I think it would be nice,” said Bobbie, “to marry someone very poor,
and then you'd do all the work and he'd love you most frightfully, and
see the blue wood smoke curling up among the trees from the domestic
hearth as he came home from work every night. I say--we've got to answer
that letter and say that the time and place WILL be convenient to us.
There's the soap, Peter. WE'RE both as clean as clean. That pink box of
writing paper you had on your birthday, Phil.”

It took some time to arrange what should be said. Mother had gone back
to her writing, and several sheets of pink paper with scalloped gilt
edges and green four-leaved shamrocks in the corner were spoiled before
the three had decided what to say. Then each made a copy and signed it
with its own name.

The threefold letter ran:--

“Dear Mr. Jabez Inglewood,--Thank you very much. We did not want to be
rewarded but only to save the train, but we are glad you think so and
thank you very much. The time and place you say will be quite convenient
to us. Thank you very much.

          “Your affecate little friend,”

Then came the name, and after it:--

“P.S. Thank you very much.”

“Washing is much easier than ironing,” said Bobbie, taking the clean dry
dresses off the line. “I do love to see things come clean. Oh--I don't
know how we shall wait till it's time to know what presentation they're
going to present!”

When at last--it seemed a very long time after--it was THE day,
the three children went down to the station at the proper time. And
everything that happened was so odd that it seemed like a dream. The
Station Master came out to meet them--in his best clothes, as Peter
noticed at once--and led them into the waiting room where once they had
played the advertisement game. It looked quite different now. A carpet
had been put down--and there were pots of roses on the mantelpiece and
on the window ledges--green branches stuck up, like holly and laurel
are at Christmas, over the framed advertisement of Cook's Tours and the
Beauties of Devon and the Paris Lyons Railway. There were quite a
number of people there besides the Porter--two or three ladies in
smart dresses, and quite a crowd of gentlemen in high hats and frock
coats--besides everybody who belonged to the station. They recognized
several people who had been in the train on the red-flannel-petticoat
day. Best of all their own old gentleman was there, and his coat and hat
and collar seemed more than ever different from anyone else's. He shook
hands with them and then everybody sat down on chairs, and a gentleman
in spectacles--they found out afterwards that he was the District
Superintendent--began quite a long speech--very clever indeed. I am not
going to write the speech down. First, because you would think it dull;
and secondly, because it made all the children blush so, and get so hot
about the ears that I am quite anxious to get away from this part of the
subject; and thirdly, because the gentleman took so many words to say
what he had to say that I really haven't time to write them down. He
said all sorts of nice things about the children's bravery and presence
of mind, and when he had done he sat down, and everyone who was there
clapped and said, “Hear, hear.”

And then the old gentleman got up and said things, too. It was very like
a prize-giving. And then he called the children one by one, by their
names, and gave each of them a beautiful gold watch and chain. And
inside the watches were engraved after the name of the watch's new
owner:--

“From the Directors of the Northern and Southern Railway in grateful
recognition of the courageous and prompt action which averted an
accident on --- 1905.”

The watches were the most beautiful you can possibly imagine, and each
one had a blue leather case to live in when it was at home.

“You must make a speech now and thank everyone for their kindness,”
 whispered the Station Master in Peter's ear and pushed him forward.
“Begin 'Ladies and Gentlemen,'” he added.

Each of the children had already said “Thank you,” quite properly.

“Oh, dear,” said Peter, but he did not resist the push.

“Ladies and Gentlemen,” he said in a rather husky voice. Then there
was a pause, and he heard his heart beating in his throat. “Ladies and
Gentlemen,” he went on with a rush, “it's most awfully good of you, and
we shall treasure the watches all our lives--but really we don't deserve
it because what we did wasn't anything, really. At least, I mean it
was awfully exciting, and what I mean to say--thank you all very, very
much.”

The people clapped Peter more than they had done the District
Superintendent, and then everybody shook hands with them, and as soon as
politeness would let them, they got away, and tore up the hill to Three
Chimneys with their watches in their hands.

It was a wonderful day--the kind of day that very seldom happens to
anybody and to most of us not at all.

“I did want to talk to the old gentleman about something else,” said
Bobbie, “but it was so public--like being in church.”

“What did you want to say?” asked Phyllis.

“I'll tell you when I've thought about it more,” said Bobbie.

So when she had thought a little more she wrote a letter.

“My dearest old gentleman,” it said; “I want most awfully to ask you
something. If you could get out of the train and go by the next, it
would do. I do not want you to give me anything. Mother says we ought
not to. And besides, we do not want any THINGS. Only to talk to you
about a Prisoner and Captive. Your loving little friend,

          “Bobbie.”

She got the Station Master to give the letter to the old gentleman, and
next day she asked Peter and Phyllis to come down to the station with
her at the time when the train that brought the old gentleman from town
would be passing through.

She explained her idea to them--and they approved thoroughly.

They had all washed their hands and faces, and brushed their hair, and
were looking as tidy as they knew how. But Phyllis, always unlucky, had
upset a jug of lemonade down the front of her dress. There was no time
to change--and the wind happening to blow from the coal yard, her frock
was soon powdered with grey, which stuck to the sticky lemonade stains
and made her look, as Peter said, “like any little gutter child.”

It was decided that she should keep behind the others as much as
possible.

“Perhaps the old gentleman won't notice,” said Bobbie. “The aged are
often weak in the eyes.”

There was no sign of weakness, however, in the eyes, or in any other
part of the old gentleman, as he stepped from the train and looked up
and down the platform.

The three children, now that it came to the point, suddenly felt that
rush of deep shyness which makes your ears red and hot, your hands warm
and wet, and the tip of your nose pink and shiny.

“Oh,” said Phyllis, “my heart's thumping like a steam-engine--right
under my sash, too.”

“Nonsense,” said Peter, “people's hearts aren't under their sashes.”

“I don't care--mine is,” said Phyllis.

“If you're going to talk like a poetry-book,” said Peter, “my heart's in
my mouth.”

“My heart's in my boots--if you come to that,” said Roberta; “but do
come on--he'll think we're idiots.”

“He won't be far wrong,” said Peter, gloomily. And they went forward to
meet the old gentleman.

“Hullo,” he said, shaking hands with them all in turn. “This is a very
great pleasure.”

“It WAS good of you to get out,” Bobbie said, perspiring and polite.

He took her arm and drew her into the waiting room where she and the
others had played the advertisement game the day they found the Russian.
Phyllis and Peter followed. “Well?” said the old gentleman, giving
Bobbie's arm a kind little shake before he let it go. “Well? What is
it?”

“Oh, please!” said Bobbie.

“Yes?” said the old gentleman.

“What I mean to say--” said Bobbie.

“Well?” said the old gentleman.

“It's all very nice and kind,” said she.

“But?” he said.

“I wish I might say something,” she said.

“Say it,” said he.

“Well, then,” said Bobbie--and out came the story of the Russian who
had written the beautiful book about poor people, and had been sent to
prison and to Siberia for just that.

“And what we want more than anything in the world is to find his wife
and children for him,” said Bobbie, “but we don't know how. But you must
be most horribly clever, or you wouldn't be a Direction of the Railway.
And if YOU knew how--and would? We'd rather have that than anything else
in the world. We'd go without the watches, even, if you could sell them
and find his wife with the money.”

And the others said so, too, though not with so much enthusiasm.

“Hum,” said the old gentleman, pulling down the white waistcoat that
had the big gilt buttons on it, “what did you say the name
was--Fryingpansky?”

“No, no,” said Bobbie earnestly. “I'll write it down for you. It doesn't
really look at all like that except when you say it. Have you a bit of
pencil and the back of an envelope?” she asked.

The old gentleman got out a gold pencil-case and a beautiful,
sweet-smelling, green Russian leather note-book and opened it at a new
page.

“Here,” he said, “write here.”

She wrote down “Szezcpansky,” and said:--

“That's how you write it. You CALL it Shepansky.”

The old gentleman took out a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles and fitted
them on his nose. When he had read the name, he looked quite different.

“THAT man? Bless my soul!” he said. “Why, I've read his book! It's
translated into every European language. A fine book--a noble book. And
so your mother took him in--like the good Samaritan. Well, well. I'll
tell you what, youngsters--your mother must be a very good woman.”

“Of course she is,” said Phyllis, in astonishment.

“And you're a very good man,” said Bobbie, very shy, but firmly resolved
to be polite.

“You flatter me,” said the old gentleman, taking off his hat with a
flourish. “And now am I to tell you what I think of you?”

“Oh, please don't,” said Bobbie, hastily.

“Why?” asked the old gentleman.

“I don't exactly know,” said Bobbie. “Only--if it's horrid, I don't want
you to; and if it's nice, I'd rather you didn't.”

The old gentleman laughed.

“Well, then,” he said, “I'll only just say that I'm very glad you came
to me about this--very glad, indeed. And I shouldn't be surprised if I
found out something very soon. I know a great many Russians in London,
and every Russian knows HIS name. Now tell me all about yourselves.”

He turned to the others, but there was only one other, and that was
Peter. Phyllis had disappeared.

“Tell me all about yourself,” said the old gentleman again. And, quite
naturally, Peter was stricken dumb.

“All right, we'll have an examination,” said the old gentleman; “you two
sit on the table, and I'll sit on the bench and ask questions.”

He did, and out came their names and ages--their Father's name and
business--how long they had lived at Three Chimneys and a great deal
more.

The questions were beginning to turn on a herring and a half for three
halfpence, and a pound of lead and a pound of feathers, when the door of
the waiting room was kicked open by a boot; as the boot entered everyone
could see that its lace was coming undone--and in came Phyllis, very
slowly and carefully.

In one hand she carried a large tin can, and in the other a thick slice
of bread and butter.

“Afternoon tea,” she announced proudly, and held the can and the bread
and butter out to the old gentleman, who took them and said:--

“Bless my soul!”

“Yes,” said Phyllis.

“It's very thoughtful of you,” said the old gentleman, “very.”

“But you might have got a cup,” said Bobbie, “and a plate.”

“Perks always drinks out of the can,” said Phyllis, flushing red. “I
think it was very nice of him to give it me at all--let alone cups and
plates,” she added.

“So do I,” said the old gentleman, and he drank some of the tea and
tasted the bread and butter.

And then it was time for the next train, and he got into it with many
good-byes and kind last words.

“Well,” said Peter, when they were left on the platform, and the
tail-lights of the train disappeared round the corner, “it's my belief
that we've lighted a candle to-day--like Latimer, you know, when he was
being burned--and there'll be fireworks for our Russian before long.”

And so there were.

It wasn't ten days after the interview in the waiting room that the
three children were sitting on the top of the biggest rock in the field
below their house watching the 5.15 steam away from the station along
the bottom of the valley. They saw, too, the few people who had got out
at the station straggling up the road towards the village--and they saw
one person leave the road and open the gate that led across the fields
to Three Chimneys and to nowhere else.

“Who on earth!” said Peter, scrambling down.

“Let's go and see,” said Phyllis.

So they did. And when they got near enough to see who the person was,
they saw it was their old gentleman himself, his brass buttons winking
in the afternoon sunshine, and his white waistcoat looking whiter than
ever against the green of the field.

“Hullo!” shouted the children, waving their hands.

“Hullo!” shouted the old gentleman, waving his hat.

Then the three started to run--and when they got to him they hardly had
breath left to say:--

“How do you do?”

“Good news,” said he. “I've found your Russian friend's wife and
child--and I couldn't resist the temptation of giving myself the
pleasure of telling him.”

But as he looked at Bobbie's face he felt that he COULD resist that
temptation.

“Here,” he said to her, “you run on and tell him. The other two will
show me the way.”

Bobbie ran. But when she had breathlessly panted out the news to the
Russian and Mother sitting in the quiet garden--when Mother's face had
lighted up so beautifully, and she had said half a dozen quick French
words to the Exile--Bobbie wished that she had NOT carried the news. For
the Russian sprang up with a cry that made Bobbie's heart leap and then
tremble--a cry of love and longing such as she had never heard. Then he
took Mother's hand and kissed it gently and reverently--and then he sank
down in his chair and covered his face with his hands and sobbed. Bobbie
crept away. She did not want to see the others just then.

But she was as gay as anybody when the endless French talking was over,
when Peter had torn down to the village for buns and cakes, and the
girls had got tea ready and taken it out into the garden.

The old gentleman was most merry and delightful. He seemed to be able
to talk in French and English almost at the same moment, and Mother did
nearly as well. It was a delightful time. Mother seemed as if she could
not make enough fuss about the old gentleman, and she said yes at once
when he asked if he might present some “goodies” to his little friends.

The word was new to the children--but they guessed that it meant sweets,
for the three large pink and green boxes, tied with green ribbon, which
he took out of his bag, held unheard-of layers of beautiful chocolates.

The Russian's few belongings were packed, and they all saw him off at
the station.

Then Mother turned to the old gentleman and said:--

“I don't know how to thank you for EVERYTHING. It has been a real
pleasure to me to see you. But we live very quietly. I am so sorry that
I can't ask you to come and see us again.”

The children thought this very hard. When they HAD made a friend--and
such a friend--they would dearly have liked him to come and see them
again.

What the old gentleman thought they couldn't tell. He only said:--

“I consider myself very fortunate, Madam, to have been received once at
your house.”

“Ah,” said Mother, “I know I must seem surly and ungrateful--but--”

“You could never seem anything but a most charming and gracious lady,”
 said the old gentleman, with another of his bows.

And as they turned to go up the hill, Bobbie saw her Mother's face.

“How tired you look, Mammy,” she said; “lean on me.”

“It's my place to give Mother my arm,” said Peter. “I'm the head man of
the family when Father's away.”

Mother took an arm of each.

“How awfully nice,” said Phyllis, skipping joyfully, “to think of the
dear Russian embracing his long-lost wife. The baby must have grown a
lot since he saw it.”

“Yes,” said Mother.

“I wonder whether Father will think I'VE grown,” Phyllis went on,
skipping still more gaily. “I have grown already, haven't I, Mother?”

“Yes,” said Mother, “oh, yes,” and Bobbie and Peter felt her hands
tighten on their arms.

“Poor old Mammy, you ARE tired,” said Peter.

Bobbie said, “Come on, Phil; I'll race you to the gate.”

And she started the race, though she hated doing it. YOU know why Bobbie
did that. Mother only thought that Bobbie was tired of walking slowly.
Even Mothers, who love you better than anyone else ever will, don't
always understand.



Chapter VIII. The amateur firemen.


“That's a likely little brooch you've got on, Miss,” said Perks the
Porter; “I don't know as ever I see a thing more like a buttercup
without it WAS a buttercup.”

“Yes,” said Bobbie, glad and flushed by this approval. “I always thought
it was more like a buttercup almost than even a real one--and I NEVER
thought it would come to be mine, my very own--and then Mother gave it
to me for my birthday.”

“Oh, have you had a birthday?” said Perks; and he seemed quite
surprised, as though a birthday were a thing only granted to a favoured
few.

“Yes,” said Bobbie; “when's your birthday, Mr. Perks?” The children were
taking tea with Mr. Perks in the Porters' room among the lamps and
the railway almanacs. They had brought their own cups and some jam
turnovers. Mr. Perks made tea in a beer can, as usual, and everyone felt
very happy and confidential.

“My birthday?” said Perks, tipping some more dark brown tea out of the
can into Peter's cup. “I give up keeping of my birthday afore you was
born.”

“But you must have been born SOMETIME, you know,” said Phyllis,
thoughtfully, “even if it was twenty years ago--or thirty or sixty or
seventy.”

“Not so long as that, Missie,” Perks grinned as he answered. “If you
really want to know, it was thirty-two years ago, come the fifteenth of
this month.”

“Then why don't you keep it?” asked Phyllis.

“I've got something else to keep besides birthdays,” said Perks,
briefly.

“Oh! What?” asked Phyllis, eagerly. “Not secrets?”

“No,” said Perks, “the kids and the Missus.”

It was this talk that set the children thinking, and, presently,
talking. Perks was, on the whole, the dearest friend they had made. Not
so grand as the Station Master, but more approachable--less powerful
than the old gentleman, but more confidential.

“It seems horrid that nobody keeps his birthday,” said Bobbie. “Couldn't
WE do something?”

“Let's go up to the Canal bridge and talk it over,” said Peter. “I got a
new gut line from the postman this morning. He gave it me for a bunch of
roses that I gave him for his sweetheart. She's ill.”

“Then I do think you might have given her the roses for nothing,” said
Bobbie, indignantly.

“Nyang, nyang!” said Peter, disagreeably, and put his hands in his
pockets.

“He did, of course,” said Phyllis, in haste; “directly we heard she was
ill we got the roses ready and waited by the gate. It was when you were
making the brekker-toast. And when he'd said 'Thank you' for the roses
so many times--much more than he need have--he pulled out the line and
gave it to Peter. It wasn't exchange. It was the grateful heart.”

“Oh, I BEG your pardon, Peter,” said Bobbie, “I AM so sorry.”

“Don't mention it,” said Peter, grandly, “I knew you would be.”

So then they all went up to the Canal bridge. The idea was to fish from
the bridge, but the line was not quite long enough.

“Never mind,” said Bobbie. “Let's just stay here and look at things.
Everything's so beautiful.”

It was. The sun was setting in red splendour over the grey and purple
hills, and the canal lay smooth and shiny in the shadow--no ripple broke
its surface. It was like a grey satin ribbon between the dusky green
silk of the meadows that were on each side of its banks.

“It's all right,” said Peter, “but somehow I can always see how pretty
things are much better when I've something to do. Let's get down on to
the towpath and fish from there.”

Phyllis and Bobbie remembered how the boys on the canal-boats had thrown
coal at them, and they said so.

“Oh, nonsense,” said Peter. “There aren't any boys here now. If there
were, I'd fight them.”

Peter's sisters were kind enough not to remind him how he had NOT fought
the boys when coal had last been thrown. Instead they said, “All right,
then,” and cautiously climbed down the steep bank to the towing-path.
The line was carefully baited, and for half an hour they fished
patiently and in vain. Not a single nibble came to nourish hope in their
hearts.

All eyes were intent on the sluggish waters that earnestly pretended
they had never harboured a single minnow when a loud rough shout made
them start.

“Hi!” said the shout, in most disagreeable tones, “get out of that,
can't you?”

An old white horse coming along the towing-path was within half a dozen
yards of them. They sprang to their feet and hastily climbed up the
bank.

“We'll slip down again when they've gone by,” said Bobbie.

But, alas, the barge, after the manner of barges, stopped under the
bridge.

“She's going to anchor,” said Peter; “just our luck!”

The barge did not anchor, because an anchor is not part of a
canal-boat's furniture, but she was moored with ropes fore and aft--and
the ropes were made fast to the palings and to crowbars driven into the
ground.

“What you staring at?” growled the Bargee, crossly.

“We weren't staring,” said Bobbie; “we wouldn't be so rude.”

“Rude be blessed,” said the man; “get along with you!”

“Get along yourself,” said Peter. He remembered what he had said about
fighting boys, and, besides, he felt safe halfway up the bank. “We've as
much right here as anyone else.”

“Oh, 'AVE you, indeed!” said the man. “We'll soon see about that.” And
he came across his deck and began to climb down the side of his barge.

“Oh, come away, Peter, come away!” said Bobbie and Phyllis, in agonised
unison.

“Not me,” said Peter, “but YOU'D better.”

The girls climbed to the top of the bank and stood ready to bolt for
home as soon as they saw their brother out of danger. The way home lay
all down hill. They knew that they all ran well. The Bargee did not look
as if HE did. He was red-faced, heavy, and beefy.

But as soon as his foot was on the towing-path the children saw that
they had misjudged him.

He made one spring up the bank and caught Peter by the leg, dragged him
down--set him on his feet with a shake--took him by the ear--and said
sternly:--

“Now, then, what do you mean by it? Don't you know these 'ere waters is
preserved? You ain't no right catching fish 'ere--not to say nothing of
your precious cheek.”

Peter was always proud afterwards when he remembered that, with the
Bargee's furious fingers tightening on his ear, the Bargee's crimson
countenance close to his own, the Bargee's hot breath on his neck, he
had the courage to speak the truth.

“I WASN'T catching fish,” said Peter.

“That's not YOUR fault, I'll be bound,” said the man, giving Peter's ear
a twist--not a hard one--but still a twist.

Peter could not say that it was. Bobbie and Phyllis had been holding
on to the railings above and skipping with anxiety. Now suddenly Bobbie
slipped through the railings and rushed down the bank towards Peter, so
impetuously that Phyllis, following more temperately, felt certain that
her sister's descent would end in the waters of the canal. And so it
would have done if the Bargee hadn't let go of Peter's ear--and caught
her in his jerseyed arm.

“Who are you a-shoving of?” he said, setting her on her feet.

“Oh,” said Bobbie, breathless, “I'm not shoving anybody. At least, not
on purpose. Please don't be cross with Peter. Of course, if it's your
canal, we're sorry and we won't any more. But we didn't know it was
yours.”

“Go along with you,” said the Bargee.

“Yes, we will; indeed we will,” said Bobbie, earnestly; “but we do beg
your pardon--and really we haven't caught a single fish. I'd tell you
directly if we had, honour bright I would.”

She held out her hands and Phyllis turned out her little empty pocket to
show that really they hadn't any fish concealed about them.

“Well,” said the Bargee, more gently, “cut along, then, and don't you do
it again, that's all.”

The children hurried up the bank.

“Chuck us a coat, M'ria,” shouted the man. And a red-haired woman in a
green plaid shawl came out from the cabin door with a baby in her arms
and threw a coat to him. He put it on, climbed the bank, and slouched
along across the bridge towards the village.

“You'll find me up at the 'Rose and Crown' when you've got the kid to
sleep,” he called to her from the bridge.

When he was out of sight the children slowly returned. Peter insisted on
this.

“The canal may belong to him,” he said, “though I don't believe it
does. But the bridge is everybody's. Doctor Forrest told me it's public
property. I'm not going to be bounced off the bridge by him or anyone
else, so I tell you.”

Peter's ear was still sore and so were his feelings.

The girls followed him as gallant soldiers might follow the leader of a
forlorn hope.

“I do wish you wouldn't,” was all they said.

“Go home if you're afraid,” said Peter; “leave me alone. I'M not
afraid.”

The sound of the man's footsteps died away along the quiet road. The
peace of the evening was not broken by the notes of the sedge-warblers
or by the voice of the woman in the barge, singing her baby to sleep. It
was a sad song she sang. Something about Bill Bailey and how she wanted
him to come home.

The children stood leaning their arms on the parapet of the bridge; they
were glad to be quiet for a few minutes because all three hearts were
beating much more quickly.

“I'm not going to be driven away by any old bargeman, I'm not,” said
Peter, thickly.

“Of course not,” Phyllis said soothingly; “you didn't give in to him! So
now we might go home, don't you think?”

“NO,” said Peter.

Nothing more was said till the woman got off the barge, climbed the
bank, and came across the bridge.

She hesitated, looking at the three backs of the children, then she
said, “Ahem.”

Peter stayed as he was, but the girls looked round.

“You mustn't take no notice of my Bill,” said the woman; “'is bark's
worse'n 'is bite. Some of the kids down Farley way is fair terrors. It
was them put 'is back up calling out about who ate the puppy-pie under
Marlow bridge.”

“Who DID?” asked Phyllis.

“_I_ dunno,” said the woman. “Nobody don't know! But somehow, and I
don't know the why nor the wherefore of it, them words is p'ison to a
barge-master. Don't you take no notice. 'E won't be back for two hours
good. You might catch a power o' fish afore that. The light's good an'
all,” she added.

“Thank you,” said Bobbie. “You're very kind. Where's your baby?”

“Asleep in the cabin,” said the woman. “'E's all right. Never wakes
afore twelve. Reg'lar as a church clock, 'e is.”

“I'm sorry,” said Bobbie; “I would have liked to see him, close to.”

“And a finer you never did see, Miss, though I says it.” The woman's
face brightened as she spoke.

“Aren't you afraid to leave it?” said Peter.

“Lor' love you, no,” said the woman; “who'd hurt a little thing like
'im? Besides, Spot's there. So long!”

The woman went away.

“Shall we go home?” said Phyllis.

“You can. I'm going to fish,” said Peter briefly.

“I thought we came up here to talk about Perks's birthday,” said
Phyllis.

“Perks's birthday'll keep.”

So they got down on the towing-path again and Peter fished. He did not
catch anything.

It was almost quite dark, the girls were getting tired, and as Bobbie
said, it was past bedtime, when suddenly Phyllis cried, “What's that?”

And she pointed to the canal boat. Smoke was coming from the chimney of
the cabin, had indeed been curling softly into the soft evening air all
the time--but now other wreaths of smoke were rising, and these were
from the cabin door.

“It's on fire--that's all,” said Peter, calmly. “Serve him right.”

“Oh--how CAN you?” cried Phyllis. “Think of the poor dear dog.”

“The BABY!” screamed Bobbie.

In an instant all three made for the barge.

Her mooring ropes were slack, and the little breeze, hardly strong
enough to be felt, had yet been strong enough to drift her stern against
the bank. Bobbie was first--then came Peter, and it was Peter who
slipped and fell. He went into the canal up to his neck, and his feet
could not feel the bottom, but his arm was on the edge of the barge.
Phyllis caught at his hair. It hurt, but it helped him to get out. Next
minute he had leaped on to the barge, Phyllis following.

“Not you!” he shouted to Bobbie; “ME, because I'm wet.”

He caught up with Bobbie at the cabin door, and flung her aside very
roughly indeed; if they had been playing, such roughness would have made
Bobbie weep with tears of rage and pain. Now, though he flung her on
to the edge of the hold, so that her knee and her elbow were grazed and
bruised, she only cried:--

“No--not you--ME,” and struggled up again. But not quickly enough.

Peter had already gone down two of the cabin steps into the cloud of
thick smoke. He stopped, remembered all he had ever heard of fires,
pulled his soaked handkerchief out of his breast pocket and tied it over
his mouth. As he pulled it out he said:--

“It's all right, hardly any fire at all.”

And this, though he thought it was a lie, was rather good of Peter. It
was meant to keep Bobbie from rushing after him into danger. Of course
it didn't.

The cabin glowed red. A paraffin lamp was burning calmly in an orange
mist.

“Hi,” said Peter, lifting the handkerchief from his mouth for a moment.
“Hi, Baby--where are you?” He choked.

“Oh, let ME go,” cried Bobbie, close behind him. Peter pushed her back
more roughly than before, and went on.

Now what would have happened if the baby hadn't cried I don't know--but
just at that moment it DID cry. Peter felt his way through the dark
smoke, found something small and soft and warm and alive, picked it up
and backed out, nearly tumbling over Bobbie who was close behind. A dog
snapped at his leg--tried to bark, choked.

“I've got the kid,” said Peter, tearing off the handkerchief and
staggering on to the deck.

Bobbie caught at the place where the bark came from, and her hands met
on the fat back of a smooth-haired dog. It turned and fastened its teeth
on her hand, but very gently, as much as to say:--

“I'm bound to bark and bite if strangers come into my master's cabin,
but I know you mean well, so I won't REALLY bite.”

Bobbie dropped the dog.

“All right, old man. Good dog,” said she. “Here--give me the baby,
Peter; you're so wet you'll give it cold.”

Peter was only too glad to hand over the strange little bundle that
squirmed and whimpered in his arms.

“Now,” said Bobbie, quickly, “you run straight to the 'Rose and Crown'
and tell them. Phil and I will stay here with the precious. Hush, then,
a dear, a duck, a darling! Go NOW, Peter! Run!”

“I can't run in these things,” said Peter, firmly; “they're as heavy as
lead. I'll walk.”

“Then I'LL run,” said Bobbie. “Get on the bank, Phil, and I'll hand you
the dear.”

The baby was carefully handed. Phyllis sat down on the bank and tried to
hush the baby. Peter wrung the water from his sleeves and knickerbocker
legs as well as he could, and it was Bobbie who ran like the wind across
the bridge and up the long white quiet twilight road towards the 'Rose
and Crown.'

There is a nice old-fashioned room at the 'Rose and Crown; where Bargees
and their wives sit of an evening drinking their supper beer, and
toasting their supper cheese at a glowing basketful of coals that
sticks out into the room under a great hooded chimney and is warmer and
prettier and more comforting than any other fireplace _I_ ever saw.

There was a pleasant party of barge people round the fire. You might
not have thought it pleasant, but they did; for they were all friends
or acquaintances, and they liked the same sort of things, and talked
the same sort of talk. This is the real secret of pleasant society. The
Bargee Bill, whom the children had found so disagreeable, was considered
excellent company by his mates. He was telling a tale of his own
wrongs--always a thrilling subject. It was his barge he was speaking
about.

“And 'e sent down word 'paint her inside hout,' not namin' no colour,
d'ye see? So I gets a lotter green paint and I paints her stem to stern,
and I tell yer she looked A1. Then 'E comes along and 'e says, 'Wot yer
paint 'er all one colour for?' 'e says. And I says, says I, 'Cause I
thought she'd look fust-rate,' says I, 'and I think so still.' An' he
says, 'DEW yer? Then ye can just pay for the bloomin' paint yerself,'
says he. An' I 'ad to, too.” A murmur of sympathy ran round the
room. Breaking noisily in on it came Bobbie. She burst open the swing
door--crying breathlessly:--

“Bill! I want Bill the Bargeman.”

There was a stupefied silence. Pots of beer were held in mid-air,
paralysed on their way to thirsty mouths.

“Oh,” said Bobbie, seeing the bargewoman and making for her. “Your barge
cabin's on fire. Go quickly.”

The woman started to her feet, and put a big red hand to her waist, on
the left side, where your heart seems to be when you are frightened or
miserable.

“Reginald Horace!” she cried in a terrible voice; “my Reginald Horace!”

“All right,” said Bobbie, “if you mean the baby; got him out safe. Dog,
too.” She had no breath for more, except, “Go on--it's all alight.”

Then she sank on the ale-house bench and tried to get that breath of
relief after running which people call the 'second wind.' But she felt
as though she would never breathe again.

Bill the Bargee rose slowly and heavily. But his wife was a hundred
yards up the road before he had quite understood what was the matter.

Phyllis, shivering by the canal side, had hardly heard the quick
approaching feet before the woman had flung herself on the railing,
rolled down the bank, and snatched the baby from her.

“Don't,” said Phyllis, reproachfully; “I'd just got him to sleep.”

          *          *          *          *          *          *

Bill came up later talking in a language with which the children were
wholly unfamiliar. He leaped on to the barge and dipped up pails
of water. Peter helped him and they put out the fire. Phyllis, the
bargewoman, and the baby--and presently Bobbie, too--cuddled together in
a heap on the bank.

“Lord help me, if it was me left anything as could catch alight,” said
the woman again and again.

But it wasn't she. It was Bill the Bargeman, who had knocked his pipe
out and the red ash had fallen on the hearth-rug and smouldered there
and at last broken into flame. Though a stern man he was just. He did
not blame his wife for what was his own fault, as many bargemen, and
other men, too, would have done.

Mother was half wild with anxiety when at last the three children turned
up at Three Chimneys, all very wet by now, for Peter seemed to have come
off on the others. But when she had disentangled the truth of what had
happened from their mixed and incoherent narrative, she owned that they
had done quite right, and could not possibly have done otherwise. Nor
did she put any obstacles in the way of their accepting the cordial
invitation with which the bargeman had parted from them.

“Ye be here at seven to-morrow,” he had said, “and I'll take you the
entire trip to Farley and back, so I will, and not a penny to pay.
Nineteen locks!”

They did not know what locks were; but they were at the bridge at seven,
with bread and cheese and half a soda cake, and quite a quarter of a leg
of mutton in a basket.

It was a glorious day. The old white horse strained at the ropes, the
barge glided smoothly and steadily through the still water. The sky was
blue overhead. Mr. Bill was as nice as anyone could possibly be. No one
would have thought that he could be the same man who had held Peter by
the ear. As for Mrs. Bill, she had always been nice, as Bobbie said, and
so had the baby, and even Spot, who might have bitten them quite badly
if he had liked.

“It was simply ripping, Mother,” said Peter, when they reached home very
happy, very tired, and very dirty, “right over that glorious aqueduct.
And locks--you don't know what they're like. You sink into the ground
and then, when you feel you're never going to stop going down, two great
black gates open slowly, slowly--you go out, and there you are on the
canal just like you were before.”

“I know,” said Mother, “there are locks on the Thames. Father and I used
to go on the river at Marlow before we were married.”

“And the dear, darling, ducky baby,” said Bobbie; “it let me nurse it
for ages and ages--and it WAS so good. Mother, I wish we had a baby to
play with.”

“And everybody was so nice to us,” said Phyllis, “everybody we met. And
they say we may fish whenever we like. And Bill is going to show us the
way next time he's in these parts. He says we don't know really.”

“He said YOU didn't know,” said Peter; “but, Mother, he said he'd tell
all the bargees up and down the canal that we were the real, right sort,
and they were to treat us like good pals, as we were.”

“So then I said,” Phyllis interrupted, “we'd always each wear a red
ribbon when we went fishing by the canal, so they'd know it was US, and
we were the real, right sort, and be nice to us!”

“So you've made another lot of friends,” said Mother; “first the railway
and then the canal!”

“Oh, yes,” said Bobbie; “I think everyone in the world is friends if you
can only get them to see you don't want to be UN-friends.”

“Perhaps you're right,” said Mother; and she sighed. “Come, Chicks. It's
bedtime.”

“Yes,” said Phyllis. “Oh dear--and we went up there to talk about what
we'd do for Perks's birthday. And we haven't talked a single thing about
it!”

“No more we have,” said Bobbie; “but Peter's saved Reginald Horace's
life. I think that's about good enough for one evening.”

“Bobbie would have saved him if I hadn't knocked her down; twice I did,”
 said Peter, loyally.

“So would I,” said Phyllis, “if I'd known what to do.”

“Yes,” said Mother, “you've saved a little child's life. I do think
that's enough for one evening. Oh, my darlings, thank God YOU'RE all
safe!”



Chapter IX. The pride of Perks.


It was breakfast-time. Mother's face was very bright as she poured the
milk and ladled out the porridge.

“I've sold another story, Chickies,” she said; “the one about the King
of the Mussels, so there'll be buns for tea. You can go and get them as
soon as they're baked. About eleven, isn't it?”

Peter, Phyllis, and Bobbie exchanged glances with each other, six
glances in all. Then Bobbie said:--

“Mother, would you mind if we didn't have the buns for tea to-night, but
on the fifteenth? That's next Thursday.”

“_I_ don't mind when you have them, dear,” said Mother, “but why?”

“Because it's Perks's birthday,” said Bobbie; “he's thirty-two, and
he says he doesn't keep his birthday any more, because he's got other
things to keep--not rabbits or secrets--but the kids and the missus.”

“You mean his wife and children,” said Mother.

“Yes,” said Phyllis; “it's the same thing, isn't it?”

“And we thought we'd make a nice birthday for him. He's been so awfully
jolly decent to us, you know, Mother,” said Peter, “and we agreed that
next bun-day we'd ask you if we could.”

“But suppose there hadn't been a bun-day before the fifteenth?” said
Mother.

“Oh, then, we meant to ask you to let us anti--antipate it, and go
without when the bun-day came.”

“Anticipate,” said Mother. “I see. Certainly. It would be nice to put
his name on the buns with pink sugar, wouldn't it?”

“Perks,” said Peter, “it's not a pretty name.”

“His other name's Albert,” said Phyllis; “I asked him once.”

“We might put A. P.,” said Mother; “I'll show you how when the day
comes.”

This was all very well as far as it went. But even fourteen halfpenny
buns with A. P. on them in pink sugar do not of themselves make a very
grand celebration.

“There are always flowers, of course,” said Bobbie, later, when a really
earnest council was being held on the subject in the hay-loft where
the broken chaff-cutting machine was, and the row of holes to drop hay
through into the hay-racks over the mangers of the stables below.

“He's got lots of flowers of his own,” said Peter.

“But it's always nice to have them given you,” said Bobbie, “however
many you've got of your own. We can use flowers for trimmings to the
birthday. But there must be something to trim besides buns.”

“Let's all be quiet and think,” said Phyllis; “no one's to speak until
it's thought of something.”

So they were all quiet and so very still that a brown rat thought that
there was no one in the loft and came out very boldly. When Bobbie
sneezed, the rat was quite shocked and hurried away, for he saw that a
hay-loft where such things could happen was no place for a respectable
middle-aged rat that liked a quiet life.

“Hooray!” cried Peter, suddenly, “I've got it.” He jumped up and kicked
at the loose hay.

“What?” said the others, eagerly.

“Why, Perks is so nice to everybody. There must be lots of people in the
village who'd like to help to make him a birthday. Let's go round and
ask everybody.”

“Mother said we weren't to ask people for things,” said Bobbie,
doubtfully.

“For ourselves, she meant, silly, not for other people. I'll ask the old
gentleman too. You see if I don't,” said Peter.

“Let's ask Mother first,” said Bobbie.

“Oh, what's the use of bothering Mother about every little thing?”
 said Peter, “especially when she's busy. Come on. Let's go down to the
village now and begin.”

So they went. The old lady at the Post-office said she didn't see why
Perks should have a birthday any more than anyone else.

“No,” said Bobbie, “I should like everyone to have one. Only we know
when his is.”

“Mine's to-morrow,” said the old lady, “and much notice anyone will take
of it. Go along with you.”

So they went.

And some people were kind, and some were crusty. And some would give and
some would not. It is rather difficult work asking for things, even for
other people, as you have no doubt found if you have ever tried it.

When the children got home and counted up what had been given and what
had been promised, they felt that for the first day it was not so bad.
Peter wrote down the lists of the things in the little pocket-book where
he kept the numbers of his engines. These were the lists:--

     GIVEN.
     A tobacco pipe from the sweet shop.
     Half a pound of tea from the grocer's.
     A woollen scarf slightly faded from the draper's, which was the
         other side of the grocer's.
     A stuffed squirrel from the Doctor.

     PROMISED.
     A piece of meat from the butcher.
     Six fresh eggs from the woman who lived in the old turnpike cottage.
     A piece of honeycomb and six bootlaces from the cobbler, and an
         iron shovel from the blacksmith's.

Very early next morning Bobbie got up and woke Phyllis. This had been
agreed on between them. They had not told Peter because they thought he
would think it silly. But they told him afterwards, when it had turned
out all right.

They cut a big bunch of roses, and put it in a basket with the
needle-book that Phyllis had made for Bobbie on her birthday, and a very
pretty blue necktie of Phyllis's. Then they wrote on a paper: 'For Mrs.
Ransome, with our best love, because it is her birthday,' and they put
the paper in the basket, and they took it to the Post-office, and went
in and put it on the counter and ran away before the old woman at the
Post-office had time to get into her shop.

When they got home Peter had grown confidential over helping Mother to
get the breakfast and had told her their plans.

“There's no harm in it,” said Mother, “but it depends HOW you do it. I
only hope he won't be offended and think it's CHARITY. Poor people are
very proud, you know.”

“It isn't because he's poor,” said Phyllis; “it's because we're fond of
him.”

“I'll find some things that Phyllis has outgrown,” said Mother, “if
you're quite sure you can give them to him without his being offended. I
should like to do some little thing for him because he's been so kind to
you. I can't do much because we're poor ourselves. What are you writing,
Bobbie?”

“Nothing particular,” said Bobbie, who had suddenly begun to scribble.
“I'm sure he'd like the things, Mother.”

The morning of the fifteenth was spent very happily in getting the buns
and watching Mother make A. P. on them with pink sugar. You know how
it's done, of course? You beat up whites of eggs and mix powdered sugar
with them, and put in a few drops of cochineal. And then you make a cone
of clean, white paper with a little hole at the pointed end, and put the
pink egg-sugar in at the big end. It runs slowly out at the pointed end,
and you write the letters with it just as though it were a great fat pen
full of pink sugar-ink.

The buns looked beautiful with A. P. on every one, and, when they were
put in a cool oven to set the sugar, the children went up to the village
to collect the honey and the shovel and the other promised things.

The old lady at the Post-office was standing on her doorstep. The
children said “Good morning,” politely, as they passed.

“Here, stop a bit,” she said.

So they stopped.

“Those roses,” said she.

“Did you like them?” said Phyllis; “they were as fresh as fresh. _I_
made the needle-book, but it was Bobbie's present.” She skipped joyously
as she spoke.

“Here's your basket,” said the Post-office woman. She went in and
brought out the basket. It was full of fat, red gooseberries.

“I dare say Perks's children would like them,” said she.

“You ARE an old dear,” said Phyllis, throwing her arms around the old
lady's fat waist. “Perks WILL be pleased.”

“He won't be half so pleased as I was with your needle-book and the tie
and the pretty flowers and all,” said the old lady, patting Phyllis's
shoulder. “You're good little souls, that you are. Look here. I've got a
pram round the back in the wood-lodge. It was got for my Emmie's first,
that didn't live but six months, and she never had but that one. I'd
like Mrs. Perks to have it. It 'ud be a help to her with that great boy
of hers. Will you take it along?”

“OH!” said all the children together.

When Mrs. Ransome had got out the perambulator and taken off the careful
papers that covered it, and dusted it all over, she said:--

“Well, there it is. I don't know but what I'd have given it to her
before if I'd thought of it. Only I didn't quite know if she'd accept of
it from me. You tell her it was my Emmie's little one's pram--”

“Oh, ISN'T it nice to think there is going to be a real live baby in it
again!”

“Yes,” said Mrs. Ransome, sighing, and then laughing; “here, I'll give
you some peppermint cushions for the little ones, and then you run along
before I give you the roof off my head and the clothes off my back.”

All the things that had been collected for Perks were packed into
the perambulator, and at half-past three Peter and Bobbie and Phyllis
wheeled it down to the little yellow house where Perks lived.

The house was very tidy. On the window ledge was a jug of wild-flowers,
big daisies, and red sorrel, and feathery, flowery grasses.

There was a sound of splashing from the wash-house, and a partly washed
boy put his head round the door.

“Mother's a-changing of herself,” he said.

“Down in a minute,” a voice sounded down the narrow, freshly scrubbed
stairs.

The children waited. Next moment the stairs creaked and Mrs. Perks came
down, buttoning her bodice. Her hair was brushed very smooth and tight,
and her face shone with soap and water.

“I'm a bit late changing, Miss,” she said to Bobbie, “owing to me having
had a extry clean-up to-day, along o' Perks happening to name its being
his birthday. I don't know what put it into his head to think of such
a thing. We keeps the children's birthdays, of course; but him and
me--we're too old for such like, as a general rule.”

“We knew it was his birthday,” said Peter, “and we've got some presents
for him outside in the perambulator.”

As the presents were being unpacked, Mrs. Perks gasped. When they
were all unpacked, she surprised and horrified the children by sitting
suddenly down on a wooden chair and bursting into tears.

“Oh, don't!” said everybody; “oh, please don't!” And Peter added,
perhaps a little impatiently: “What on earth is the matter? You don't
mean to say you don't like it?”

Mrs. Perks only sobbed. The Perks children, now as shiny-faced as anyone
could wish, stood at the wash-house door, and scowled at the intruders.
There was a silence, an awkward silence.

“DON'T you like it?” said Peter, again, while his sisters patted Mrs.
Perks on the back.

She stopped crying as suddenly as she had begun.

“There, there, don't you mind me. I'M all right!” she said. “Like it?
Why, it's a birthday such as Perks never 'ad, not even when 'e was a boy
and stayed with his uncle, who was a corn chandler in his own account.
He failed afterwards. Like it? Oh--” and then she went on and said all
sorts of things that I won't write down, because I am sure that Peter
and Bobbie and Phyllis would not like me to. Their ears got hotter and
hotter, and their faces redder and redder, at the kind things Mrs. Perks
said. They felt they had done nothing to deserve all this praise.

At last Peter said: “Look here, we're glad you're pleased. But if you go
on saying things like that, we must go home. And we did want to stay and
see if Mr. Perks is pleased, too. But we can't stand this.”

“I won't say another single word,” said Mrs. Perks, with a beaming face,
“but that needn't stop me thinking, need it? For if ever--”

“Can we have a plate for the buns?” Bobbie asked abruptly. And then Mrs.
Perks hastily laid the table for tea, and the buns and the honey and
the gooseberries were displayed on plates, and the roses were put in two
glass jam jars, and the tea-table looked, as Mrs. Perks said, “fit for a
Prince.”

“To think!” she said, “me getting the place tidy early, and the little
'uns getting the wild-flowers and all--when never did I think there'd be
anything more for him except the ounce of his pet particular that I
got o' Saturday and been saving up for 'im ever since. Bless us! 'e IS
early!”

Perks had indeed unlatched the latch of the little front gate.

“Oh,” whispered Bobbie, “let's hide in the back kitchen, and YOU tell
him about it. But give him the tobacco first, because you got it for
him. And when you've told him, we'll all come in and shout, 'Many happy
returns!'”

It was a very nice plan, but it did not quite come off. To begin with,
there was only just time for Peter and Bobbie and Phyllis to rush into
the wash-house, pushing the young and open-mouthed Perks children in
front of them. There was not time to shut the door, so that, without at
all meaning it, they had to listen to what went on in the kitchen. The
wash-house was a tight fit for the Perks children and the Three Chimneys
children, as well as all the wash-house's proper furniture, including
the mangle and the copper.

“Hullo, old woman!” they heard Mr. Perks's voice say; “here's a pretty
set-out!”

“It's your birthday tea, Bert,” said Mrs. Perks, “and here's a ounce of
your extry particular. I got it o' Saturday along o' your happening to
remember it was your birthday to-day.”

“Good old girl!” said Mr. Perks, and there was a sound of a kiss.

“But what's that pram doing here? And what's all these bundles? And
where did you get the sweetstuff, and--”

The children did not hear what Mrs. Perks replied, because just then
Bobbie gave a start, put her hand in her pocket, and all her body grew
stiff with horror.

“Oh!” she whispered to the others, “whatever shall we do? I forgot to
put the labels on any of the things! He won't know what's from who.
He'll think it's all US, and that we're trying to be grand or charitable
or something horrid.”

“Hush!” said Peter.

And then they heard the voice of Mr. Perks, loud and rather angry.

“I don't care,” he said; “I won't stand it, and so I tell you straight.”

“But,” said Mrs. Perks, “it's them children you make such a fuss
about--the children from the Three Chimneys.”

“I don't care,” said Perks, firmly, “not if it was a angel from Heaven.
We've got on all right all these years and no favours asked. I'm not
going to begin these sort of charity goings-on at my time of life, so
don't you think it, Nell.”

“Oh, hush!” said poor Mrs Perks; “Bert, shut your silly tongue, for
goodness' sake. The all three of 'ems in the wash-house a-listening to
every word you speaks.”

“Then I'll give them something to listen to,” said the angry Perks;
“I've spoke my mind to them afore now, and I'll do it again,” he added,
and he took two strides to the wash-house door, and flung it wide
open--as wide, that is, as it would go, with the tightly packed children
behind it.

“Come out,” said Perks, “come out and tell me what you mean by it. 'Ave
I ever complained to you of being short, as you comes this charity lay
over me?”

“OH!” said Phyllis, “I thought you'd be so pleased; I'll never try to be
kind to anyone else as long as I live. No, I won't, not never.”

She burst into tears.

“We didn't mean any harm,” said Peter.

“It ain't what you means so much as what you does,” said Perks.

“Oh, DON'T!” cried Bobbie, trying hard to be braver than Phyllis, and to
find more words than Peter had done for explaining in. “We thought you'd
love it. We always have things on our birthdays.”

“Oh, yes,” said Perks, “your own relations; that's different.”

“Oh, no,” Bobbie answered. “NOT our own relations. All the servants
always gave us things at home, and us to them when it was their
birthdays. And when it was mine, and Mother gave me the brooch like a
buttercup, Mrs. Viney gave me two lovely glass pots, and nobody thought
she was coming the charity lay over us.”

“If it had been glass pots here,” said Perks, “I wouldn't ha' said so
much. It's there being all this heaps and heaps of things I can't stand.
No--nor won't, neither.”

“But they're not all from us--” said Peter, “only we forgot to put the
labels on. They're from all sorts of people in the village.”

“Who put 'em up to it, I'd like to know?” asked Perks.

“Why, we did,” sniffed Phyllis.

Perks sat down heavily in the elbow-chair and looked at them with what
Bobbie afterwards described as withering glances of gloomy despair.

“So you've been round telling the neighbours we can't make both
ends meet? Well, now you've disgraced us as deep as you can in the
neighbourhood, you can just take the whole bag of tricks back w'ere it
come from. Very much obliged, I'm sure. I don't doubt but what you meant
it kind, but I'd rather not be acquainted with you any longer if it's
all the same to you.” He deliberately turned the chair round so that
his back was turned to the children. The legs of the chair grated on the
brick floor, and that was the only sound that broke the silence.

Then suddenly Bobbie spoke.

“Look here,” she said, “this is most awful.”

“That's what I says,” said Perks, not turning round.

“Look here,” said Bobbie, desperately, “we'll go if you like--and you
needn't be friends with us any more if you don't want, but--”

“WE shall always be friends with YOU, however nasty you are to us,”
 sniffed Phyllis, wildly.

“Be quiet,” said Peter, in a fierce aside.

“But before we go,” Bobbie went on desperately, “do let us show you the
labels we wrote to put on the things.”

“I don't want to see no labels,” said Perks, “except proper luggage ones
in my own walk of life. Do you think I've kept respectable and outer
debt on what I gets, and her having to take in washing, to be give away
for a laughing-stock to all the neighbours?”

“Laughing?” said Peter; “you don't know.”

“You're a very hasty gentleman,” whined Phyllis; “you know you were
wrong once before, about us not telling you the secret about the
Russian. Do let Bobbie tell you about the labels!”

“Well. Go ahead!” said Perks, grudgingly.

“Well, then,” said Bobbie, fumbling miserably, yet not without hope, in
her tightly stuffed pocket, “we wrote down all the things everybody said
when they gave us the things, with the people's names, because Mother
said we ought to be careful--because--but I wrote down what she
said--and you'll see.”

But Bobbie could not read the labels just at once. She had to swallow
once or twice before she could begin.

Mrs. Perks had been crying steadily ever since her husband had opened
the wash-house door. Now she caught her breath, choked, and said:--

“Don't you upset yourself, Missy. _I_ know you meant it kind if he
doesn't.”

“May I read the labels?” said Bobbie, crying on to the slips as she
tried to sort them. “Mother's first. It says:--

“'Little Clothes for Mrs. Perks's children.' Mother said, 'I'll find
some of Phyllis's things that she's grown out of if you're quite sure
Mr. Perks wouldn't be offended and think it's meant for charity. I'd
like to do some little thing for him, because he's so kind to you. I
can't do much because we're poor ourselves.'”

Bobbie paused.

“That's all right,” said Perks, “your Ma's a born lady. We'll keep the
little frocks, and what not, Nell.”

“Then there's the perambulator and the gooseberries, and the sweets,”
 said Bobbie, “they're from Mrs. Ransome. She said: 'I dare say Mr.
Perks's children would like the sweets. And the perambulator was got for
my Emmie's first--it didn't live but six months, and she's never had but
that one. I'd like Mrs. Perks to have it. It would be a help with her
fine boy. I'd have given it before if I'd been sure she'd accept of
it from me.' She told me to tell you,” Bobbie added, “that it was her
Emmie's little one's pram.”

“I can't send that pram back, Bert,” said Mrs Perks, firmly, “and I
won't. So don't you ask me--”

“I'm not a-asking anything,” said Perks, gruffly.

“Then the shovel,” said Bobbie. “Mr. James made it for you himself. And
he said--where is it? Oh, yes, here! He said, 'You tell Mr. Perks it's a
pleasure to make a little trifle for a man as is so much respected,' and
then he said he wished he could shoe your children and his own children,
like they do the horses, because, well, he knew what shoe leather was.”

“James is a good enough chap,” said Perks.

“Then the honey,” said Bobbie, in haste, “and the boot-laces. HE said
he respected a man that paid his way--and the butcher said the same. And
the old turnpike woman said many was the time you'd lent her a hand
with her garden when you were a lad--and things like that came home to
roost--I don't know what she meant. And everybody who gave anything said
they liked you, and it was a very good idea of ours; and nobody said
anything about charity or anything horrid like that. And the old
gentleman gave Peter a gold pound for you, and said you were a man who
knew your work. And I thought you'd LOVE to know how fond people are
of you, and I never was so unhappy in my life. Good-bye. I hope you'll
forgive us some day--”

She could say no more, and she turned to go.

“Stop,” said Perks, still with his back to them; “I take back every word
I've said contrary to what you'd wish. Nell, set on the kettle.”

“We'll take the things away if you're unhappy about them,” said Peter;
“but I think everybody'll be most awfully disappointed, as well as us.”

“I'm not unhappy about them,” said Perks; “I don't know,” he added,
suddenly wheeling the chair round and showing a very odd-looking
screwed-up face, “I don't know as ever I was better pleased. Not so much
with the presents--though they're an A1 collection--but the kind respect
of our neighbours. That's worth having, eh, Nell?”

“I think it's all worth having,” said Mrs. Perks, “and you've made a
most ridiculous fuss about nothing, Bert, if you ask me.”

“No, I ain't,” said Perks, firmly; “if a man didn't respect hisself, no
one wouldn't do it for him.”

“But everyone respects you,” said Bobbie; “they all said so.”

“I knew you'd like it when you really understood,” said Phyllis,
brightly.

“Humph! You'll stay to tea?” said Mr. Perks.

Later on Peter proposed Mr. Perks's health. And Mr. Perks proposed a
toast, also honoured in tea, and the toast was, “May the garland of
friendship be ever green,” which was much more poetical than anyone had
expected from him.

“Jolly good little kids, those,” said Mr. Perks to his wife as they went
to bed.

“Oh, they're all right, bless their hearts,” said his wife; “it's you
that's the aggravatingest old thing that ever was. I was ashamed of
you--I tell you--”

“You didn't need to be, old gal. I climbed down handsome soon as I
understood it wasn't charity. But charity's what I never did abide, and
won't neither.”

          *          *          *          *          *          *

All sorts of people were made happy by that birthday party. Mr. Perks
and Mrs. Perks and the little Perkses by all the nice things and by the
kind thoughts of their neighbours; the Three Chimneys children by the
success, undoubted though unexpectedly delayed, of their plan; and Mrs.
Ransome every time she saw the fat Perks baby in the perambulator.
Mrs. Perks made quite a round of visits to thank people for their kind
birthday presents, and after each visit felt that she had a better
friend than she had thought.

“Yes,” said Perks, reflectively, “it's not so much what you does as what
you means; that's what I say. Now if it had been charity--”

“Oh, drat charity,” said Mrs. Perks; “nobody won't offer you
charity, Bert, however much you was to want it, I lay. That was just
friendliness, that was.”

When the clergyman called on Mrs. Perks, she told him all about it. “It
WAS friendliness, wasn't it, Sir?” said she.

“I think,” said the clergyman, “it was what is sometimes called
loving-kindness.”

So you see it was all right in the end. But if one does that sort of
thing, one has to be careful to do it in the right way. For, as Mr.
Perks said, when he had time to think it over, it's not so much what you
do, as what you mean.



Chapter X. The terrible secret.


When they first went to live at Three Chimneys, the children had talked
a great deal about their Father, and had asked a great many questions
about him, and what he was doing and where he was and when he would come
home. Mother always answered their questions as well as she could. But
as the time went on they grew to speak less of him. Bobbie had felt
almost from the first that for some strange miserable reason these
questions hurt Mother and made her sad. And little by little the others
came to have this feeling, too, though they could not have put it into
words.

One day, when Mother was working so hard that she could not leave off
even for ten minutes, Bobbie carried up her tea to the big bare room
that they called Mother's workshop. It had hardly any furniture. Just
a table and a chair and a rug. But always big pots of flowers on the
window-sills and on the mantelpiece. The children saw to that. And from
the three long uncurtained windows the beautiful stretch of meadow and
moorland, the far violet of the hills, and the unchanging changefulness
of cloud and sky.

“Here's your tea, Mother-love,” said Bobbie; “do drink it while it's
hot.”

Mother laid down her pen among the pages that were scattered all over
the table, pages covered with her writing, which was almost as plain
as print, and much prettier. She ran her hands into her hair, as if she
were going to pull it out by handfuls.

“Poor dear head,” said Bobbie, “does it ache?”

“No--yes--not much,” said Mother. “Bobbie, do you think Peter and Phil
are FORGETTING Father?”

“NO,” said Bobbie, indignantly. “Why?”

“You none of you ever speak of him now.”

Bobbie stood first on one leg and then on the other.

“We often talk about him when we're by ourselves,” she said.

“But not to me,” said Mother. “Why?”

Bobbie did not find it easy to say why.

“I--you--” she said and stopped. She went over to the window and looked
out.

“Bobbie, come here,” said her Mother, and Bobbie came.

“Now,” said Mother, putting her arm round Bobbie and laying her ruffled
head against Bobbie's shoulder, “try to tell me, dear.”

Bobbie fidgeted.

“Tell Mother.”

“Well, then,” said Bobbie, “I thought you were so unhappy about Daddy
not being here, it made you worse when I talked about him. So I stopped
doing it.”

“And the others?”

“I don't know about the others,” said Bobbie. “I never said anything
about THAT to them. But I expect they felt the same about it as me.”

“Bobbie dear,” said Mother, still leaning her head against her, “I'll
tell you. Besides parting from Father, he and I have had a great
sorrow--oh, terrible--worse than anything you can think of, and at first
it did hurt to hear you all talking of him as if everything were just
the same. But it would be much more terrible if you were to forget him.
That would be worse than anything.”

“The trouble,” said Bobbie, in a very little voice--“I promised I
would never ask you any questions, and I never have, have I? But--the
trouble--it won't last always?”

“No,” said Mother, “the worst will be over when Father comes home to
us.”

“I wish I could comfort you,” said Bobbie.

“Oh, my dear, do you suppose you don't? Do you think I haven't noticed
how good you've all been, not quarrelling nearly as much as you used
to--and all the little kind things you do for me--the flowers, and
cleaning my shoes, and tearing up to make my bed before I get time to do
it myself?”

Bobbie HAD sometimes wondered whether Mother noticed these things.

“That's nothing,” she said, “to what--”

“I MUST get on with my work,” said Mother, giving Bobbie one last
squeeze. “Don't say anything to the others.”

That evening in the hour before bed-time instead of reading to the
children Mother told them stories of the games she and Father used
to have when they were children and lived near each other in the
country--tales of the adventures of Father with Mother's brothers when
they were all boys together. Very funny stories they were, and the
children laughed as they listened.

“Uncle Edward died before he was grown up, didn't he?” said Phyllis, as
Mother lighted the bedroom candles.

“Yes, dear,” said Mother, “you would have loved him. He was such a
brave boy, and so adventurous. Always in mischief, and yet friends with
everybody in spite of it. And your Uncle Reggie's in Ceylon--yes, and
Father's away, too. But I think they'd all like to think we'd enjoyed
talking about the things they used to do. Don't you think so?”

“Not Uncle Edward,” said Phyllis, in a shocked tone; “he's in Heaven.”

“You don't suppose he's forgotten us and all the old times, because God
has taken him, any more than I forget him. Oh, no, he remembers. He's
only away for a little time. We shall see him some day.”

“And Uncle Reggie--and Father, too?” said Peter.

“Yes,” said Mother. “Uncle Reggie and Father, too. Good night, my
darlings.”

“Good night,” said everyone. Bobbie hugged her mother more closely even
than usual, and whispered in her ear, “Oh, I do love you so, Mummy--I
do--I do--”

When Bobbie came to think it all over, she tried not to wonder what
the great trouble was. But she could not always help it. Father was not
dead--like poor Uncle Edward--Mother had said so. And he was not ill, or
Mother would have been with him. Being poor wasn't the trouble. Bobbie
knew it was something nearer the heart than money could be.

“I mustn't try to think what it is,” she told herself; “no, I mustn't. I
AM glad Mother noticed about us not quarrelling so much. We'll keep that
up.”

And alas, that very afternoon she and Peter had what Peter called a
first-class shindy.

They had not been a week at Three Chimneys before they had asked Mother
to let them have a piece of garden each for their very own, and she had
agreed, and the south border under the peach trees had been divided into
three pieces and they were allowed to plant whatever they liked there.

Phyllis had planted mignonette and nasturtium and Virginia Stock in
hers. The seeds came up, and though they looked just like weeds, Phyllis
believed that they would bear flowers some day. The Virginia Stock
justified her faith quite soon, and her garden was gay with a band of
bright little flowers, pink and white and red and mauve.

“I can't weed for fear I pull up the wrong things,” she used to say
comfortably; “it saves such a lot of work.”

Peter sowed vegetable seeds in his--carrots and onions and turnips.
The seed was given to him by the farmer who lived in the nice
black-and-white, wood-and-plaster house just beyond the bridge. He
kept turkeys and guinea fowls, and was a most amiable man. But Peter's
vegetables never had much of a chance, because he liked to use the earth
of his garden for digging canals, and making forts and earthworks for
his toy soldiers. And the seeds of vegetables rarely come to much in
a soil that is constantly disturbed for the purposes of war and
irrigation.

Bobbie planted rose-bushes in her garden, but all the little new leaves
of the rose-bushes shrivelled and withered, perhaps because she moved
them from the other part of the garden in May, which is not at all the
right time of year for moving roses. But she would not own that they
were dead, and hoped on against hope, until the day when Perks came up
to see the garden, and told her quite plainly that all her roses were as
dead as doornails.

“Only good for bonfires, Miss,” he said. “You just dig 'em up and burn
'em, and I'll give you some nice fresh roots outer my garden; pansies,
and stocks, and sweet willies, and forget-me-nots. I'll bring 'em along
to-morrow if you get the ground ready.”

So next day she set to work, and that happened to be the day when Mother
had praised her and the others about not quarrelling. She moved the
rose-bushes and carried them to the other end of the garden, where the
rubbish heap was that they meant to make a bonfire of when Guy Fawkes'
Day came.

Meanwhile Peter had decided to flatten out all his forts and earthworks,
with a view to making a model of the railway-tunnel, cutting,
embankment, canal, aqueduct, bridges, and all.

So when Bobbie came back from her last thorny journey with the dead
rose-bushes, he had got the rake and was using it busily.

“_I_ was using the rake,” said Bobbie.

“Well, I'm using it now,” said Peter.

“But I had it first,” said Bobbie.

“Then it's my turn now,” said Peter. And that was how the quarrel began.

“You're always being disagreeable about nothing,” said Peter, after some
heated argument.

“I had the rake first,” said Bobbie, flushed and defiant, holding on to
its handle.

“Don't--I tell you I said this morning I meant to have it. Didn't I,
Phil?”

Phyllis said she didn't want to be mixed up in their rows. And
instantly, of course, she was.

“If you remember, you ought to say.”

“Of course she doesn't remember--but she might say so.”

“I wish I'd had a brother instead of two whiny little kiddy sisters,”
 said Peter. This was always recognised as indicating the high-water mark
of Peter's rage.

Bobbie made the reply she always made to it.

“I can't think why little boys were ever invented,” and just as she said
it she looked up, and saw the three long windows of Mother's workshop
flashing in the red rays of the sun. The sight brought back those words
of praise:--

“You don't quarrel like you used to do.”

“OH!” cried Bobbie, just as if she had been hit, or had caught her
finger in a door, or had felt the hideous sharp beginnings of toothache.

“What's the matter?” said Phyllis.

Bobbie wanted to say: “Don't let's quarrel. Mother hates it so,” but
though she tried hard, she couldn't. Peter was looking too disagreeable
and insulting.

“Take the horrid rake, then,” was the best she could manage. And she
suddenly let go her hold on the handle. Peter had been holding on to
it too firmly and pullingly, and now that the pull the other way was
suddenly stopped, he staggered and fell over backward, the teeth of the
rake between his feet.

“Serve you right,” said Bobbie, before she could stop herself.

Peter lay still for half a moment--long enough to frighten Bobbie a
little. Then he frightened her a little more, for he sat up--screamed
once--turned rather pale, and then lay back and began to shriek, faintly
but steadily. It sounded exactly like a pig being killed a quarter of a
mile off.

Mother put her head out of the window, and it wasn't half a minute after
that she was in the garden kneeling by the side of Peter, who never for
an instant ceased to squeal.

“What happened, Bobbie?” Mother asked.

“It was the rake,” said Phyllis. “Peter was pulling at it, so was
Bobbie, and she let go and he went over.”

“Stop that noise, Peter,” said Mother. “Come. Stop at once.”

Peter used up what breath he had left in a last squeal and stopped.

“Now,” said Mother, “are you hurt?”

“If he was really hurt, he wouldn't make such a fuss,” said Bobbie,
still trembling with fury; “he's not a coward!”

“I think my foot's broken off, that's all,” said Peter, huffily, and sat
up. Then he turned quite white. Mother put her arm round him.

“He IS hurt,” she said; “he's fainted. Here, Bobbie, sit down and take
his head on your lap.”

Then Mother undid Peter's boots. As she took the right one off,
something dripped from his foot on to the ground. It was red blood. And
when the stocking came off there were three red wounds in Peter's foot
and ankle, where the teeth of the rake had bitten him, and his foot was
covered with red smears.

“Run for water--a basinful,” said Mother, and Phyllis ran. She upset
most of the water out of the basin in her haste, and had to fetch more
in a jug.

Peter did not open his eyes again till Mother had tied her handkerchief
round his foot, and she and Bobbie had carried him in and laid him on
the brown wooden settle in the dining-room. By this time Phyllis was
halfway to the Doctor's.

Mother sat by Peter and bathed his foot and talked to him, and Bobbie
went out and got tea ready, and put on the kettle.

“It's all I can do,” she told herself. “Oh, suppose Peter should die, or
be a helpless cripple for life, or have to walk with crutches, or wear a
boot with a sole like a log of wood!”

She stood by the back door reflecting on these gloomy possibilities, her
eyes fixed on the water-butt.

“I wish I'd never been born,” she said, and she said it out loud.

“Why, lawk a mercy, what's that for?” asked a voice, and Perks stood
before her with a wooden trug basket full of green-leaved things and
soft, loose earth.

“Oh, it's you,” she said. “Peter's hurt his foot with a rake--three
great gaping wounds, like soldiers get. And it was partly my fault.”

“That it wasn't, I'll go bail,” said Perks. “Doctor seen him?”

“Phyllis has gone for the Doctor.”

“He'll be all right; you see if he isn't,” said Perks. “Why, my father's
second cousin had a hay-fork run into him, right into his inside, and he
was right as ever in a few weeks, all except his being a bit weak in
the head afterwards, and they did say that it was along of his getting
a touch of the sun in the hay-field, and not the fork at all. I remember
him well. A kind-'earted chap, but soft, as you might say.”

Bobbie tried to let herself be cheered by this heartening reminiscence.

“Well,” said Perks, “you won't want to be bothered with gardening just
this minute, I dare say. You show me where your garden is, and I'll
pop the bits of stuff in for you. And I'll hang about, if I may make so
free, to see the Doctor as he comes out and hear what he says. You cheer
up, Missie. I lay a pound he ain't hurt, not to speak of.”

But he was. The Doctor came and looked at the foot and bandaged it
beautifully, and said that Peter must not put it to the ground for at
least a week.

“He won't be lame, or have to wear crutches or a lump on his foot, will
he?” whispered Bobbie, breathlessly, at the door.

“My aunt! No!” said Dr. Forrest; “he'll be as nimble as ever on his pins
in a fortnight. Don't you worry, little Mother Goose.”

It was when Mother had gone to the gate with the Doctor to take his last
instructions and Phyllis was filling the kettle for tea, that Peter and
Bobbie found themselves alone.

“He says you won't be lame or anything,” said Bobbie.

“Oh, course I shan't, silly,” said Peter, very much relieved all the
same.

“Oh, Peter, I AM so sorry,” said Bobbie, after a pause.

“That's all right,” said Peter, gruffly.

“It was ALL my fault,” said Bobbie.

“Rot,” said Peter.

“If we hadn't quarrelled, it wouldn't have happened. I knew it was wrong
to quarrel. I wanted to say so, but somehow I couldn't.”

“Don't drivel,” said Peter. “I shouldn't have stopped if you HAD said
it. Not likely. And besides, us rowing hadn't anything to do with it.
I might have caught my foot in the hoe, or taken off my fingers in the
chaff-cutting machine or blown my nose off with fireworks. It would have
been hurt just the same whether we'd been rowing or not.”

“But I knew it was wrong to quarrel,” said Bobbie, in tears, “and now
you're hurt and--”

“Now look here,” said Peter, firmly, “you just dry up. If you're not
careful, you'll turn into a beastly little Sunday-school prig, so I tell
you.”

“I don't mean to be a prig. But it's so hard not to be when you're
really trying to be good.”

(The Gentle Reader may perhaps have suffered from this difficulty.)

“Not it,” said Peter; “it's a jolly good thing it wasn't you was hurt.
I'm glad it was ME. There! If it had been you, you'd have been lying
on the sofa looking like a suffering angel and being the light of the
anxious household and all that. And I couldn't have stood it.”

“No, I shouldn't,” said Bobbie.

“Yes, you would,” said Peter.

“I tell you I shouldn't.”

“I tell you you would.”

“Oh, children,” said Mother's voice at the door. “Quarrelling again?
Already?”

“We aren't quarrelling--not really,” said Peter. “I wish you wouldn't
think it's rows every time we don't agree!” When Mother had gone out
again, Bobbie broke out:--

“Peter, I AM sorry you're hurt. But you ARE a beast to say I'm a prig.”

“Well,” said Peter unexpectedly, “perhaps I am. You did say I wasn't a
coward, even when you were in such a wax. The only thing is--don't
you be a prig, that's all. You keep your eyes open and if you feel
priggishness coming on just stop in time. See?”

“Yes,” said Bobbie, “I see.”

“Then let's call it Pax,” said Peter, magnanimously: “bury the hatchet
in the fathoms of the past. Shake hands on it. I say, Bobbie, old chap,
I am tired.”

He was tired for many days after that, and the settle seemed hard and
uncomfortable in spite of all the pillows and bolsters and soft folded
rugs. It was terrible not to be able to go out. They moved the settle
to the window, and from there Peter could see the smoke of the trains
winding along the valley. But he could not see the trains.

At first Bobbie found it quite hard to be as nice to him as she wanted
to be, for fear he should think her priggish. But that soon wore off,
and both she and Phyllis were, as he observed, jolly good sorts. Mother
sat with him when his sisters were out. And the words, “he's not a
coward,” made Peter determined not to make any fuss about the pain in
his foot, though it was rather bad, especially at night.

Praise helps people very much, sometimes.

There were visitors, too. Mrs. Perks came up to ask how he was, and so
did the Station Master, and several of the village people. But the time
went slowly, slowly.

“I do wish there was something to read,” said Peter. “I've read all our
books fifty times over.”

“I'll go to the Doctor's,” said Phyllis; “he's sure to have some.”

“Only about how to be ill, and about people's nasty insides, I expect,”
 said Peter.

“Perks has a whole heap of Magazines that came out of trains when people
are tired of them,” said Bobbie. “I'll run down and ask him.”

So the girls went their two ways.

Bobbie found Perks busy cleaning lamps.

“And how's the young gent?” said he.

“Better, thanks,” said Bobbie, “but he's most frightfully bored. I came
to ask if you'd got any Magazines you could lend him.”

“There, now,” said Perks, regretfully, rubbing his ear with a black
and oily lump of cotton waste, “why didn't I think of that, now? I was
trying to think of something as 'ud amuse him only this morning, and I
couldn't think of anything better than a guinea-pig. And a young chap I
know's going to fetch that over for him this tea-time.”

“How lovely! A real live guinea! He will be pleased. But he'd like the
Magazines as well.”

“That's just it,” said Perks. “I've just sent the pick of 'em to
Snigson's boy--him what's just getting over the pewmonia. But I've lots
of illustrated papers left.”

He turned to the pile of papers in the corner and took up a heap six
inches thick.

“There!” he said. “I'll just slip a bit of string and a bit of paper
round 'em.”

He pulled an old newspaper from the pile and spread it on the table, and
made a neat parcel of it.

“There,” said he, “there's lots of pictures, and if he likes to mess 'em
about with his paint-box, or coloured chalks or what not, why, let him.
_I_ don't want 'em.”

“You're a dear,” said Bobbie, took the parcel, and started. The papers
were heavy, and when she had to wait at the level-crossing while a train
went by, she rested the parcel on the top of the gate. And idly she
looked at the printing on the paper that the parcel was wrapped in.

Suddenly she clutched the parcel tighter and bent her head over it. It
seemed like some horrible dream. She read on--the bottom of the column
was torn off--she could read no farther.

She never remembered how she got home. But she went on tiptoe to her
room and locked the door. Then she undid the parcel and read that
printed column again, sitting on the edge of her bed, her hands and feet
icy cold and her face burning. When she had read all there was, she drew
a long, uneven breath.

“So now I know,” she said.

What she had read was headed, 'End of the Trial. Verdict. Sentence.'

The name of the man who had been tried was the name of her Father.
The verdict was 'Guilty.' And the sentence was 'Five years' Penal
Servitude.'

“Oh, Daddy,” she whispered, crushing the paper hard, “it's not true--I
don't believe it. You never did it! Never, never, never!”

There was a hammering on the door.

“What is it?” said Bobbie.

“It's me,” said the voice of Phyllis; “tea's ready, and a boy's brought
Peter a guinea-pig. Come along down.”

And Bobbie had to.



Chapter XI. The hound in the red jersey.


Bobbie knew the secret now. A sheet of old newspaper wrapped round a
parcel--just a little chance like that--had given the secret to her. And
she had to go down to tea and pretend that there was nothing the matter.
The pretence was bravely made, but it wasn't very successful.

For when she came in, everyone looked up from tea and saw her
pink-lidded eyes and her pale face with red tear-blotches on it.

“My darling,” cried Mother, jumping up from the tea-tray, “whatever IS
the matter?”

“My head aches, rather,” said Bobbie. And indeed it did.

“Has anything gone wrong?” Mother asked.

“I'm all right, really,” said Bobbie, and she telegraphed to her Mother
from her swollen eyes this brief, imploring message--“NOT before the
others!”

Tea was not a cheerful meal. Peter was so distressed by the obvious fact
that something horrid had happened to Bobbie that he limited his speech
to repeating, “More bread and butter, please,” at startlingly short
intervals. Phyllis stroked her sister's hand under the table to express
sympathy, and knocked her cup over as she did it. Fetching a cloth and
wiping up the spilt milk helped Bobbie a little. But she thought that
tea would never end. Yet at last it did end, as all things do at last,
and when Mother took out the tray, Bobbie followed her.

“She's gone to own up,” said Phyllis to Peter; “I wonder what she's
done.”

“Broken something, I suppose,” said Peter, “but she needn't be so silly
over it. Mother never rows for accidents. Listen! Yes, they're going
upstairs. She's taking Mother up to show her--the water-jug with storks
on it, I expect it is.”

Bobbie, in the kitchen, had caught hold of Mother's hand as she set down
the tea-things.

“What is it?” Mother asked.

But Bobbie only said, “Come upstairs, come up where nobody can hear us.”

When she had got Mother alone in her room she locked the door and then
stood quite still, and quite without words.

All through tea she had been thinking of what to say; she had decided
that “I know all,” or “All is known to me,” or “The terrible secret is
a secret no longer,” would be the proper thing. But now that she and
her Mother and that awful sheet of newspaper were alone in the room
together, she found that she could say nothing.

Suddenly she went to Mother and put her arms round her and began to cry
again. And still she could find no words, only, “Oh, Mammy, oh, Mammy,
oh, Mammy,” over and over again.

Mother held her very close and waited.

Suddenly Bobbie broke away from her and went to her bed. From under her
mattress she pulled out the paper she had hidden there, and held it out,
pointing to her Father's name with a finger that shook.

“Oh, Bobbie,” Mother cried, when one little quick look had shown her
what it was, “you don't BELIEVE it? You don't believe Daddy did it?”

“NO,” Bobbie almost shouted. She had stopped crying.

“That's all right,” said Mother. “It's not true. And they've shut him
up in prison, but he's done nothing wrong. He's good and noble and
honourable, and he belongs to us. We have to think of that, and be proud
of him, and wait.”

Again Bobbie clung to her Mother, and again only one word came to her,
but now that word was “Daddy,” and “Oh, Daddy, oh, Daddy, oh, Daddy!”
 again and again.

“Why didn't you tell me, Mammy?” she asked presently.

“Are you going to tell the others?” Mother asked.

“No.”

“Why?”

“Because--”

“Exactly,” said Mother; “so you understand why I didn't tell you. We two
must help each other to be brave.”

“Yes,” said Bobbie; “Mother, will it make you more unhappy if you tell
me all about it? I want to understand.”

So then, sitting cuddled up close to her Mother, Bobbie heard “all
about it.” She heard how those men, who had asked to see Father on that
remembered last night when the Engine was being mended, had come
to arrest him, charging him with selling State secrets to the
Russians--with being, in fact, a spy and a traitor. She heard about the
trial, and about the evidence--letters, found in Father's desk at the
office, letters that convinced the jury that Father was guilty.

“Oh, how could they look at him and believe it!” cried Bobbie; “and how
could ANY one do such a thing!”

“SOMEONE did it,” said Mother, “and all the evidence was against Father.
Those letters--”

“Yes. How did the letters get into his desk?”

“Someone put them there. And the person who put them there was the
person who was really guilty.”

“HE must be feeling pretty awful all this time,” said Bobbie,
thoughtfully.

“I don't believe he had any feelings,” Mother said hotly; “he couldn't
have done a thing like that if he had.”

“Perhaps he just shoved the letters into the desk to hide them when he
thought he was going to be found out. Why don't you tell the lawyers,
or someone, that it must have been that person? There wasn't anyone that
would have hurt Father on purpose, was there?”

“I don't know--I don't know. The man under him who got Daddy's place
when he--when the awful thing happened--he was always jealous of your
Father because Daddy was so clever and everyone thought such a lot of
him. And Daddy never quite trusted that man.”

“Couldn't we explain all that to someone?”

“Nobody will listen,” said Mother, very bitterly, “nobody at all. Do you
suppose I've not tried everything? No, my dearest, there's nothing to be
done. All we can do, you and I and Daddy, is to be brave, and patient,
and--” she spoke very softly--“to pray, Bobbie, dear.”

“Mother, you've got very thin,” said Bobbie, abruptly.

“A little, perhaps.”

“And oh,” said Bobbie, “I do think you're the bravest person in the
world as well as the nicest!”

“We won't talk of all this any more, will we, dear?” said Mother; “we
must bear it and be brave. And, darling, try not to think of it. Try to
be cheerful, and to amuse yourself and the others. It's much easier for
me if you can be a little bit happy and enjoy things. Wash your poor
little round face, and let's go out into the garden for a bit.”

The other two were very gentle and kind to Bobbie. And they did not
ask her what was the matter. This was Peter's idea, and he had drilled
Phyllis, who would have asked a hundred questions if she had been left
to herself.

A week later Bobbie managed to get away alone. And once more she wrote a
letter. And once more it was to the old gentleman.

“My dear Friend,” she said, “you see what is in this paper. It is
not true. Father never did it. Mother says someone put the papers in
Father's desk, and she says the man under him that got Father's place
afterwards was jealous of Father, and Father suspected him a long time.
But nobody listens to a word she says, but you are so good and clever,
and you found out about the Russian gentleman's wife directly. Can't you
find out who did the treason because he wasn't Father upon my honour;
he is an Englishman and uncapable to do such things, and then they would
let Father out of prison. It is dreadful, and Mother is getting so thin.
She told us once to pray for all prisoners and captives. I see now.
Oh, do help me--there is only just Mother and me know, and we can't do
anything. Peter and Phil don't know. I'll pray for you twice every day
as long as I live if you'll only try--just try to find out. Think if it
was YOUR Daddy, what you would feel. Oh, do, do, DO help me. With love

“I remain Your affectionately little friend

“Roberta.

P.S. Mother would send her kind regards if she knew I am writing--but
it is no use telling her I am, in case you can't do anything. But I know
you will. Bobbie with best love.”

She cut the account of her Father's trial out of the newspaper with
Mother's big cutting-out scissors, and put it in the envelope with her
letter.

Then she took it down to the station, going out the back way and round
by the road, so that the others should not see her and offer to come
with her, and she gave the letter to the Station Master to give to the
old gentleman next morning.

“Where HAVE you been?” shouted Peter, from the top of the yard wall
where he and Phyllis were.

“To the station, of course,” said Bobbie; “give us a hand, Pete.”

She set her foot on the lock of the yard door. Peter reached down a
hand.

“What on earth?” she asked as she reached the wall-top--for Phyllis and
Peter were very muddy. A lump of wet clay lay between them on the wall,
they had each a slip of slate in a very dirty hand, and behind Peter,
out of the reach of accidents, were several strange rounded objects
rather like very fat sausages, hollow, but closed up at one end.

“It's nests,” said Peter, “swallows' nests. We're going to dry them
in the oven and hang them up with string under the eaves of the
coach-house.”

“Yes,” said Phyllis; “and then we're going to save up all the wool and
hair we can get, and in the spring we'll line them, and then how pleased
the swallows will be!”

“I've often thought people don't do nearly enough for dumb animals,”
 said Peter with an air of virtue. “I do think people might have thought
of making nests for poor little swallows before this.”

“Oh,” said Bobbie, vaguely, “if everybody thought of everything, there'd
be nothing left for anybody else to think about.”

“Look at the nests--aren't they pretty?” said Phyllis, reaching across
Peter to grasp a nest.

“Look out, Phil, you goat,” said her brother. But it was too late; her
strong little fingers had crushed the nest.

“There now,” said Peter.

“Never mind,” said Bobbie.

“It IS one of my own,” said Phyllis, “so you needn't jaw, Peter. Yes,
we've put our initial names on the ones we've done, so that the swallows
will know who they've got to be so grateful to and fond of.”

“Swallows can't read, silly,” said Peter.

“Silly yourself,” retorted Phyllis; “how do you know?”

“Who thought of making the nests, anyhow?” shouted Peter.

“I did,” screamed Phyllis.

“Nya,” rejoined Peter, “you only thought of making hay ones and sticking
them in the ivy for the sparrows, and they'd have been sopping LONG
before egg-laying time. It was me said clay and swallows.”

“I don't care what you said.”

“Look,” said Bobbie, “I've made the nest all right again. Give me the
bit of stick to mark your initial name on it. But how can you? Your
letter and Peter's are the same. P. for Peter, P. for Phyllis.”

“I put F. for Phyllis,” said the child of that name. “That's how
it sounds. The swallows wouldn't spell Phyllis with a P., I'm
certain-sure.”

“They can't spell at all,” Peter was still insisting.

“Then why do you see them always on Christmas cards and valentines
with letters round their necks? How would they know where to go if they
couldn't read?”

“That's only in pictures. You never saw one really with letters round
its neck.”

“Well, I have a pigeon, then; at least Daddy told me they did. Only it
was under their wings and not round their necks, but it comes to the
same thing, and--”

“I say,” interrupted Bobbie, “there's to be a paperchase to-morrow.”

“Who?” Peter asked.

“Grammar School. Perks thinks the hare will go along by the line at
first. We might go along the cutting. You can see a long way from
there.”

The paperchase was found to be a more amusing subject of conversation
than the reading powers of swallows. Bobbie had hoped it might be. And
next morning Mother let them take their lunch and go out for the day to
see the paperchase.

“If we go to the cutting,” said Peter, “we shall see the workmen, even
if we miss the paperchase.”

Of course it had taken some time to get the line clear from the rocks
and earth and trees that had fallen on it when the great landslip
happened. That was the occasion, you will remember, when the three
children saved the train from being wrecked by waving six little
red-flannel-petticoat flags. It is always interesting to watch people
working, especially when they work with such interesting things as
spades and picks and shovels and planks and barrows, when they have
cindery red fires in iron pots with round holes in them, and red lamps
hanging near the works at night. Of course the children were never
out at night; but once, at dusk, when Peter had got out of his bedroom
skylight on to the roof, he had seen the red lamp shining far away at
the edge of the cutting. The children had often been down to watch the
work, and this day the interest of picks and spades, and barrows being
wheeled along planks, completely put the paperchase out of their heads,
so that they quite jumped when a voice just behind them panted, “Let me
pass, please.” It was the hare--a big-boned, loose-limbed boy, with dark
hair lying flat on a very damp forehead. The bag of torn paper under
his arm was fastened across one shoulder by a strap. The children stood
back. The hare ran along the line, and the workmen leaned on their picks
to watch him. He ran on steadily and disappeared into the mouth of the
tunnel.

“That's against the by-laws,” said the foreman.

“Why worry?” said the oldest workman; “live and let live's what I always
say. Ain't you never been young yourself, Mr. Bates?”

“I ought to report him,” said the foreman.

“Why spoil sport's what I always say.”

“Passengers are forbidden to cross the line on any pretence,” murmured
the foreman, doubtfully.

“He ain't no passenger,” said one of the workmen.

“Nor 'e ain't crossed the line, not where we could see 'im do it,” said
another.

“Nor yet 'e ain't made no pretences,” said a third.

“And,” said the oldest workman, “'e's outer sight now. What the eye
don't see the 'art needn't take no notice of's what I always say.”

And now, following the track of the hare by the little white blots of
scattered paper, came the hounds. There were thirty of them, and they
all came down the steep, ladder-like steps by ones and twos and threes
and sixes and sevens. Bobbie and Phyllis and Peter counted them as they
passed. The foremost ones hesitated a moment at the foot of the ladder,
then their eyes caught the gleam of scattered whiteness along the line
and they turned towards the tunnel, and, by ones and twos and threes and
sixes and sevens, disappeared in the dark mouth of it. The last one, in
a red jersey, seemed to be extinguished by the darkness like a candle
that is blown out.

“They don't know what they're in for,” said the foreman; “it isn't so
easy running in the dark. The tunnel takes two or three turns.”

“They'll take a long time to get through, you think?” Peter asked.

“An hour or more, I shouldn't wonder.”

“Then let's cut across the top and see them come out at the other end,”
 said Peter; “we shall get there long before they do.”

The counsel seemed good, and they went.

They climbed the steep steps from which they had picked the wild cherry
blossom for the grave of the little wild rabbit, and reaching the top of
the cutting, set their faces towards the hill through which the tunnel
was cut. It was stiff work.

“It's like Alps,” said Bobbie, breathlessly.

“Or Andes,” said Peter.

“It's like Himmy what's its names?” gasped Phyllis. “Mount Everlasting.
Do let's stop.”

“Stick to it,” panted Peter; “you'll get your second wind in a minute.”

Phyllis consented to stick to it--and on they went, running when the
turf was smooth and the slope easy, climbing over stones, helping
themselves up rocks by the branches of trees, creeping through narrow
openings between tree trunks and rocks, and so on and on, up and up,
till at last they stood on the very top of the hill where they had so
often wished to be.

“Halt!” cried Peter, and threw himself flat on the grass. For the very
top of the hill was a smooth, turfed table-land, dotted with mossy rocks
and little mountain-ash trees.

The girls also threw themselves down flat.

“Plenty of time,” Peter panted; “the rest's all down hill.”

When they were rested enough to sit up and look round them, Bobbie
cried:--

“Oh, look!”

“What at?” said Phyllis.

“The view,” said Bobbie.

“I hate views,” said Phyllis, “don't you, Peter?”

“Let's get on,” said Peter.

“But this isn't like a view they take you to in carriages when you're
at the seaside, all sea and sand and bare hills. It's like the 'coloured
counties' in one of Mother's poetry books.”

“It's not so dusty,” said Peter; “look at the Aqueduct straddling slap
across the valley like a giant centipede, and then the towns sticking
their church spires up out of the trees like pens out of an inkstand.
_I_ think it's more like

     “There could he see the banners
      Of twelve fair cities shine.”

“I love it,” said Bobbie; “it's worth the climb.”

“The paperchase is worth the climb,” said Phyllis, “if we don't lose it.
Let's get on. It's all down hill now.”

“_I_ said that ten minutes ago,” said Peter.

“Well, I'VE said it now,” said Phyllis; “come on.”

“Loads of time,” said Peter. And there was. For when they had got down
to a level with the top of the tunnel's mouth--they were a couple of
hundred yards out of their reckoning and had to creep along the face of
the hill--there was no sign of the hare or the hounds.

“They've gone long ago, of course,” said Phyllis, as they leaned on the
brick parapet above the tunnel.

“I don't think so,” said Bobbie, “but even if they had, it's ripping
here, and we shall see the trains come out of the tunnel like dragons
out of lairs. We've never seen that from the top side before.”

“No more we have,” said Phyllis, partially appeased.

It was really a most exciting place to be in. The top of the tunnel
seemed ever so much farther from the line than they had expected, and
it was like being on a bridge, but a bridge overgrown with bushes and
creepers and grass and wild-flowers.

“I KNOW the paperchase has gone long ago,” said Phyllis every two
minutes, and she hardly knew whether she was pleased or disappointed
when Peter, leaning over the parapet, suddenly cried:--

“Look out. Here he comes!”

They all leaned over the sun-warmed brick wall in time to see the hare,
going very slowly, come out from the shadow of the tunnel.

“There, now,” said Peter, “what did I tell you? Now for the hounds!”

Very soon came the hounds--by ones and twos and threes and sixes and
sevens--and they also were going slowly and seemed very tired. Two or
three who lagged far behind came out long after the others.

“There,” said Bobbie, “that's all--now what shall we do?”

“Go along into the tulgy wood over there and have lunch,” said Phyllis;
“we can see them for miles from up here.”

“Not yet,” said Peter. “That's not the last. There's the one in the red
jersey to come yet. Let's see the last of them come out.”

But though they waited and waited and waited, the boy in the red jersey
did not appear.

“Oh, let's have lunch,” said Phyllis; “I've got a pain in my front with
being so hungry. You must have missed seeing the red-jerseyed one when
he came out with the others--”

But Bobbie and Peter agreed that he had not come out with the others.

“Let's get down to the tunnel mouth,” said Peter; “then perhaps we shall
see him coming along from the inside. I expect he felt spun-chuck, and
rested in one of the manholes. You stay up here and watch, Bob, and when
I signal from below, you come down. We might miss seeing him on the way
down, with all these trees.”

So the others climbed down and Bobbie waited till they signalled to her
from the line below. And then she, too, scrambled down the roundabout
slippery path among roots and moss till she stepped out between two
dogwood trees and joined the others on the line. And still there was no
sign of the hound with the red jersey.

“Oh, do, DO let's have something to eat,” wailed Phyllis. “I shall die
if you don't, and then you'll be sorry.”

“Give her the sandwiches, for goodness' sake, and stop her silly mouth,”
 said Peter, not quite unkindly. “Look here,” he added, turning to
Bobbie, “perhaps we'd better have one each, too. We may need all our
strength. Not more than one, though. There's no time.”

“What?” asked Bobbie, her mouth already full, for she was just as hungry
as Phyllis.

“Don't you see,” replied Peter, impressively, “that red-jerseyed hound
has had an accident--that's what it is. Perhaps even as we speak he's
lying with his head on the metals, an unresisting prey to any passing
express--”

“Oh, don't try to talk like a book,” cried Bobbie, bolting what was left
of her sandwich; “come on. Phil, keep close behind me, and if a train
comes, stand flat against the tunnel wall and hold your petticoats close
to you.”

“Give me one more sandwich,” pleaded Phyllis, “and I will.”

“I'm going first,” said Peter; “it was my idea,” and he went.

Of course you know what going into a tunnel is like? The engine gives
a scream and then suddenly the noise of the running, rattling train
changes and grows different and much louder. Grown-up people pull up the
windows and hold them by the strap. The railway carriage suddenly grows
like night--with lamps, of course, unless you are in a slow local train,
in which case lamps are not always provided. Then by and by the darkness
outside the carriage window is touched by puffs of cloudy whiteness,
then you see a blue light on the walls of the tunnel, then the sound of
the moving train changes once more, and you are out in the good open air
again, and grown-ups let the straps go. The windows, all dim with the
yellow breath of the tunnel, rattle down into their places, and you see
once more the dip and catch of the telegraph wires beside the line, and
the straight-cut hawthorn hedges with the tiny baby trees growing up out
of them every thirty yards.

All this, of course, is what a tunnel means when you are in a train. But
everything is quite different when you walk into a tunnel on your own
feet, and tread on shifting, sliding stones and gravel on a path that
curves downwards from the shining metals to the wall. Then you see
slimy, oozy trickles of water running down the inside of the tunnel,
and you notice that the bricks are not red or brown, as they are at the
tunnel's mouth, but dull, sticky, sickly green. Your voice, when you
speak, is quite changed from what it was out in the sunshine, and it is
a long time before the tunnel is quite dark.

It was not yet quite dark in the tunnel when Phyllis caught at Bobbie's
skirt, ripping out half a yard of gathers, but no one noticed this at
the time.

“I want to go back,” she said, “I don't like it. It'll be pitch dark
in a minute. I WON'T go on in the dark. I don't care what you say, I
WON'T.”

“Don't be a silly cuckoo,” said Peter; “I've got a candle end and
matches, and--what's that?”

“That” was a low, humming sound on the railway line, a trembling of the
wires beside it, a buzzing, humming sound that grew louder and louder as
they listened.

“It's a train,” said Bobbie.

“Which line?”

“Let me go back,” cried Phyllis, struggling to get away from the hand by
which Bobbie held her.

“Don't be a coward,” said Bobbie; “it's quite safe. Stand back.”

“Come on,” shouted Peter, who was a few yards ahead. “Quick! Manhole!”

The roar of the advancing train was now louder than the noise you hear
when your head is under water in the bath and both taps are running, and
you are kicking with your heels against the bath's tin sides. But Peter
had shouted for all he was worth, and Bobbie heard him. She dragged
Phyllis along to the manhole. Phyllis, of course, stumbled over the
wires and grazed both her legs. But they dragged her in, and all three
stood in the dark, damp, arched recess while the train roared louder and
louder. It seemed as if it would deafen them. And, in the distance, they
could see its eyes of fire growing bigger and brighter every instant.

“It IS a dragon--I always knew it was--it takes its own shape in here,
in the dark,” shouted Phyllis. But nobody heard her. You see the train
was shouting, too, and its voice was bigger than hers.

And now, with a rush and a roar and a rattle and a long dazzling flash
of lighted carriage windows, a smell of smoke, and blast of hot air, the
train hurtled by, clanging and jangling and echoing in the vaulted roof
of the tunnel. Phyllis and Bobbie clung to each other. Even Peter
caught hold of Bobbie's arm, “in case she should be frightened,” as he
explained afterwards.

And now, slowly and gradually, the tail-lights grew smaller and smaller,
and so did the noise, till with one last WHIZ the train got itself out
of the tunnel, and silence settled again on its damp walls and dripping
roof.

“OH!” said the children, all together in a whisper.

Peter was lighting the candle end with a hand that trembled.

“Come on,” he said; but he had to clear his throat before he could speak
in his natural voice.

“Oh,” said Phyllis, “if the red-jerseyed one was in the way of the
train!”

“We've got to go and see,” said Peter.

“Couldn't we go and send someone from the station?” said Phyllis.

“Would you rather wait here for us?” asked Bobbie, severely, and of
course that settled the question.

So the three went on into the deeper darkness of the tunnel. Peter led,
holding his candle end high to light the way. The grease ran down his
fingers, and some of it right up his sleeve. He found a long streak from
wrist to elbow when he went to bed that night.

It was not more than a hundred and fifty yards from the spot where
they had stood while the train went by that Peter stood still, shouted
“Hullo,” and then went on much quicker than before. When the others
caught him up, he stopped. And he stopped within a yard of what they had
come into the tunnel to look for. Phyllis saw a gleam of red, and
shut her eyes tight. There, by the curved, pebbly down line, was the
red-jerseyed hound. His back was against the wall, his arms hung limply
by his sides, and his eyes were shut.

“Was the red, blood? Is he all killed?” asked Phyllis, screwing her
eyelids more tightly together.

“Killed? Nonsense!” said Peter. “There's nothing red about him except
his jersey. He's only fainted. What on earth are we to do?”

“Can we move him?” asked Bobbie.

“I don't know; he's a big chap.”

“Suppose we bathe his forehead with water. No, I know we haven't any,
but milk's just as wet. There's a whole bottle.”

“Yes,” said Peter, “and they rub people's hands, I believe.”

“They burn feathers, I know,” said Phyllis.

“What's the good of saying that when we haven't any feathers?”

“As it happens,” said Phyllis, in a tone of exasperated triumph, “I've
got a shuttlecock in my pocket. So there!”

And now Peter rubbed the hands of the red-jerseyed one. Bobbie burned
the feathers of the shuttlecock one by one under his nose, Phyllis
splashed warmish milk on his forehead, and all three kept on saying as
fast and as earnestly as they could:--

“Oh, look up, speak to me! For my sake, speak!”



Chapter XII. What Bobbie brought home.


“Oh, look up! Speak to me! For MY sake, speak!” The children said the
words over and over again to the unconscious hound in a red jersey, who
sat with closed eyes and pale face against the side of the tunnel.

“Wet his ears with milk,” said Bobbie. “I know they do it to people that
faint--with eau-de-Cologne. But I expect milk's just as good.”

So they wetted his ears, and some of the milk ran down his neck under
the red jersey. It was very dark in the tunnel. The candle end Peter had
carried, and which now burned on a flat stone, gave hardly any light at
all.

“Oh, DO look up,” said Phyllis. “For MY sake! I believe he's dead.”

“For MY sake,” repeated Bobbie. “No, he isn't.”

“For ANY sake,” said Peter; “come out of it.” And he shook the sufferer
by the arm.

And then the boy in the red jersey sighed, and opened his eyes, and shut
them again and said in a very small voice, “Chuck it.”

“Oh, he's NOT dead,” said Phyllis. “I KNEW he wasn't,” and she began to
cry.

“What's up? I'm all right,” said the boy.

“Drink this,” said Peter, firmly, thrusting the nose of the milk bottle
into the boy's mouth. The boy struggled, and some of the milk was upset
before he could get his mouth free to say:--

“What is it?”

“It's milk,” said Peter. “Fear not, you are in the hands of friends.
Phil, you stop bleating this minute.”

“Do drink it,” said Bobbie, gently; “it'll do you good.”

So he drank. And the three stood by without speaking to him.

“Let him be a minute,” Peter whispered; “he'll be all right as soon as
the milk begins to run like fire through his veins.”

He was.

“I'm better now,” he announced. “I remember all about it.” He tried to
move, but the movement ended in a groan. “Bother! I believe I've broken
my leg,” he said.

“Did you tumble down?” asked Phyllis, sniffing.

“Of course not--I'm not a kiddie,” said the boy, indignantly; “it was
one of those beastly wires tripped me up, and when I tried to get up
again I couldn't stand, so I sat down. Gee whillikins! it does hurt,
though. How did YOU get here?”

“We saw you all go into the tunnel and then we went across the hill to
see you all come out. And the others did--all but you, and you didn't.
So we are a rescue party,” said Peter, with pride.

“You've got some pluck, I will say,” remarked the boy.

“Oh, that's nothing,” said Peter, with modesty. “Do you think you could
walk if we helped you?”

“I could try,” said the boy.

He did try. But he could only stand on one foot; the other dragged in a
very nasty way.

“Here, let me sit down. I feel like dying,” said the boy. “Let go of
me--let go, quick--” He lay down and closed his eyes. The others looked
at each other by the dim light of the little candle.

“What on earth!” said Peter.

“Look here,” said Bobbie, quickly, “you must go and get help. Go to the
nearest house.”

“Yes, that's the only thing,” said Peter. “Come on.”

“If you take his feet and Phil and I take his head, we could carry him
to the manhole.”

They did it. It was perhaps as well for the sufferer that he had fainted
again.

“Now,” said Bobbie, “I'll stay with him. You take the longest bit of
candle, and, oh--be quick, for this bit won't burn long.”

“I don't think Mother would like me leaving you,” said Peter,
doubtfully. “Let me stay, and you and Phil go.”

“No, no,” said Bobbie, “you and Phil go--and lend me your knife. I'll
try to get his boot off before he wakes up again.”

“I hope it's all right what we're doing,” said Peter.

“Of course it's right,” said Bobbie, impatiently. “What else WOULD you
do? Leave him here all alone because it's dark? Nonsense. Hurry up,
that's all.”

So they hurried up.

Bobbie watched their dark figures and the little light of the little
candle with an odd feeling of having come to the end of everything. She
knew now, she thought, what nuns who were bricked up alive in convent
walls felt like. Suddenly she gave herself a little shake.

“Don't be a silly little girl,” she said. She was always very angry when
anyone else called her a little girl, even if the adjective that went
first was not “silly” but “nice” or “good” or “clever.” And it was only
when she was very angry with herself that she allowed Roberta to use
that expression to Bobbie.

She fixed the little candle end on a broken brick near the red-jerseyed
boy's feet. Then she opened Peter's knife. It was always hard to
manage--a halfpenny was generally needed to get it open at all. This
time Bobbie somehow got it open with her thumbnail. She broke the nail,
and it hurt horribly. Then she cut the boy's bootlace, and got the boot
off. She tried to pull off his stocking, but his leg was dreadfully
swollen, and it did not seem to be the proper shape. So she cut the
stocking down, very slowly and carefully. It was a brown, knitted
stocking, and she wondered who had knitted it, and whether it was the
boy's mother, and whether she was feeling anxious about him, and how she
would feel when he was brought home with his leg broken. When Bobbie had
got the stocking off and saw the poor leg, she felt as though the tunnel
was growing darker, and the ground felt unsteady, and nothing seemed
quite real.

“SILLY little girl!” said Roberta to Bobbie, and felt better.

“The poor leg,” she told herself; “it ought to have a cushion--ah!”

She remembered the day when she and Phyllis had torn up their red
flannel petticoats to make danger signals to stop the train and prevent
an accident. Her flannel petticoat to-day was white, but it would be
quite as soft as a red one. She took it off.

“Oh, what useful things flannel petticoats are!” she said; “the man who
invented them ought to have a statue directed to him.” And she said
it aloud, because it seemed that any voice, even her own, would be a
comfort in that darkness.

“WHAT ought to be directed? Who to?” asked the boy, suddenly and very
feebly.

“Oh,” said Bobbie, “now you're better! Hold your teeth and don't let it
hurt too much. Now!”

She had folded the petticoat, and lifting his leg laid it on the cushion
of folded flannel.

“Don't faint again, PLEASE don't,” said Bobbie, as he groaned. She
hastily wetted her handkerchief with milk and spread it over the poor
leg.

“Oh, that hurts,” cried the boy, shrinking. “Oh--no, it doesn't--it's
nice, really.”

“What's your name?” said Bobbie.

“Jim.”

“Mine's Bobbie.”

“But you're a girl, aren't you?”

“Yes, my long name's Roberta.”

“I say--Bobbie.”

“Yes?”

“Wasn't there some more of you just now?”

“Yes, Peter and Phil--that's my brother and sister. They've gone to get
someone to carry you out.”

“What rum names. All boys'.”

“Yes--I wish I was a boy, don't you?”

“I think you're all right as you are.”

“I didn't mean that--I meant don't you wish YOU were a boy, but of
course you are without wishing.”

“You're just as brave as a boy. Why didn't you go with the others?”

“Somebody had to stay with you,” said Bobbie.

“Tell you what, Bobbie,” said Jim, “you're a brick. Shake.” He reached
out a red-jerseyed arm and Bobbie squeezed his hand.

“I won't shake it,” she explained, “because it would shake YOU, and that
would shake your poor leg, and that would hurt. Have you got a hanky?”

“I don't expect I have.” He felt in his pocket. “Yes, I have. What for?”

She took it and wetted it with milk and put it on his forehead.

“That's jolly,” he said; “what is it?”

“Milk,” said Bobbie. “We haven't any water--”

“You're a jolly good little nurse,” said Jim.

“I do it for Mother sometimes,” said Bobbie--“not milk, of course,
but scent, or vinegar and water. I say, I must put the candle out now,
because there mayn't be enough of the other one to get you out by.”

“By George,” said he, “you think of everything.”

Bobbie blew. Out went the candle. You have no idea how black-velvety the
darkness was.

“I say, Bobbie,” said a voice through the blackness, “aren't you afraid
of the dark?”

“Not--not very, that is--”

“Let's hold hands,” said the boy, and it was really rather good of him,
because he was like most boys of his age and hated all material tokens
of affection, such as kissing and holding of hands. He called all such
things “pawings,” and detested them.

The darkness was more bearable to Bobbie now that her hand was held in
the large rough hand of the red-jerseyed sufferer; and he, holding her
little smooth hot paw, was surprised to find that he did not mind it so
much as he expected. She tried to talk, to amuse him, and “take his mind
off” his sufferings, but it is very difficult to go on talking in the
dark, and presently they found themselves in a silence, only broken now
and then by a--

“You all right, Bobbie?”

or an--

“I'm afraid it's hurting you most awfully, Jim. I AM so sorry.”

And it was very cold.

          *          *          *          *          *          *

Peter and Phyllis tramped down the long way of the tunnel towards
daylight, the candle-grease dripping over Peter's fingers. There were no
accidents unless you count Phyllis's catching her frock on a wire, and
tearing a long, jagged slit in it, and tripping over her bootlace when
it came undone, or going down on her hands and knees, all four of which
were grazed.

“There's no end to this tunnel,” said Phyllis--and indeed it did seem
very very long.

“Stick to it,” said Peter; “everything has an end, and you get to it if
you only keep all on.”

Which is quite true, if you come to think of it, and a useful thing
to remember in seasons of trouble--such as measles, arithmetic,
impositions, and those times when you are in disgrace, and feel as
though no one would ever love you again, and you could never--never
again--love anybody.

“Hurray,” said Peter, suddenly, “there's the end of the tunnel--looks
just like a pin-hole in a bit of black paper, doesn't it?”

The pin-hole got larger--blue lights lay along the sides of the tunnel.
The children could see the gravel way that lay in front of them; the air
grew warmer and sweeter. Another twenty steps and they were out in the
good glad sunshine with the green trees on both sides.

Phyllis drew a long breath.

“I'll never go into a tunnel again as long as ever I live,” said she,
“not if there are twenty hundred thousand millions hounds inside with
red jerseys and their legs broken.”

“Don't be a silly cuckoo,” said Peter, as usual. “You'd HAVE to.”

“I think it was very brave and good of me,” said Phyllis.

“Not it,” said Peter; “you didn't go because you were brave, but because
Bobbie and I aren't skunks. Now where's the nearest house, I wonder? You
can't see anything here for the trees.”

“There's a roof over there,” said Phyllis, pointing down the line.

“That's the signal-box,” said Peter, “and you know you're not allowed to
speak to signalmen on duty. It's wrong.”

“I'm not near so afraid of doing wrong as I was of going into that
tunnel,” said Phyllis. “Come on,” and she started to run along the line.
So Peter ran, too.

It was very hot in the sunshine, and both children were hot and
breathless by the time they stopped, and bending their heads back to
look up at the open windows of the signal-box, shouted “Hi!” as loud
as their breathless state allowed. But no one answered. The signal-box
stood quiet as an empty nursery, and the handrail of its steps was hot
to the hands of the children as they climbed softly up. They peeped
in at the open door. The signalman was sitting on a chair tilted back
against the wall. His head leaned sideways, and his mouth was open. He
was fast asleep.

“My hat!” cried Peter; “wake up!” And he cried it in a terrible voice,
for he knew that if a signalman sleeps on duty, he risks losing his
situation, let alone all the other dreadful risks to trains which expect
him to tell them when it is safe for them to go their ways.

The signalman never moved. Then Peter sprang to him and shook him. And
slowly, yawning and stretching, the man awoke. But the moment he WAS
awake he leapt to his feet, put his hands to his head “like a mad
maniac,” as Phyllis said afterwards, and shouted:--

“Oh, my heavens--what's o'clock?”

“Twelve thirteen,” said Peter, and indeed it was by the white-faced,
round-faced clock on the wall of the signal-box.

The man looked at the clock, sprang to the levers, and wrenched them
this way and that. An electric bell tingled--the wires and cranks
creaked, and the man threw himself into a chair. He was very pale,
and the sweat stood on his forehead “like large dewdrops on a white
cabbage,” as Phyllis remarked later. He was trembling, too; the children
could see his big hairy hands shake from side to side, “with quite
extra-sized trembles,” to use the subsequent words of Peter. He drew
long breaths. Then suddenly he cried, “Thank God, thank God you come in
when you did--oh, thank God!” and his shoulders began to heave and his
face grew red again, and he hid it in those large hairy hands of his.

“Oh, don't cry--don't,” said Phyllis, “it's all right now,” and she
patted him on one big, broad shoulder, while Peter conscientiously
thumped the other.

But the signalman seemed quite broken down, and the children had to
pat him and thump him for quite a long time before he found his
handkerchief--a red one with mauve and white horseshoes on it--and
mopped his face and spoke. During this patting and thumping interval a
train thundered by.

“I'm downright shamed, that I am,” were the words of the big signalman
when he had stopped crying; “snivelling like a kid.” Then suddenly he
seemed to get cross. “And what was you doing up here, anyway?” he said;
“you know it ain't allowed.”

“Yes,” said Phyllis, “we knew it was wrong--but I wasn't afraid of doing
wrong, and so it turned out right. You aren't sorry we came.”

“Lor' love you--if you hadn't 'a' come--” he stopped and then went on.
“It's a disgrace, so it is, sleeping on duty. If it was to come to be
known--even as it is, when no harm's come of it.”

“It won't come to be known,” said Peter; “we aren't sneaks. All the
same, you oughtn't to sleep on duty--it's dangerous.”

“Tell me something I don't know,” said the man, “but I can't help it.
I know'd well enough just how it 'ud be. But I couldn't get off. They
couldn't get no one to take on my duty. I tell you I ain't had ten
minutes' sleep this last five days. My little chap's ill--pewmonia, the
Doctor says--and there's no one but me and 'is little sister to do for
him. That's where it is. The gell must 'ave her sleep. Dangerous? Yes, I
believe you. Now go and split on me if you like.”

“Of course we won't,” said Peter, indignantly, but Phyllis ignored the
whole of the signalman's speech, except the first six words.

“You asked us,” she said, “to tell you something you don't know. Well,
I will. There's a boy in the tunnel over there with a red jersey and his
leg broken.”

“What did he want to go into the blooming tunnel for, then?” said the
man.

“Don't you be so cross,” said Phyllis, kindly. “WE haven't done anything
wrong except coming and waking you up, and that was right, as it
happens.”

Then Peter told how the boy came to be in the tunnel.

“Well,” said the man, “I don't see as I can do anything. I can't leave
the box.”

“You might tell us where to go after someone who isn't in a box,
though,” said Phyllis.

“There's Brigden's farm over yonder--where you see the smoke a-coming
up through the trees,” said the man, more and more grumpy, as Phyllis
noticed.

“Well, good-bye, then,” said Peter.

But the man said, “Wait a minute.” He put his hand in his pocket and
brought out some money--a lot of pennies and one or two shillings and
sixpences and half-a-crown. He picked out two shillings and held them
out.

“Here,” he said. “I'll give you this to hold your tongues about what's
taken place to-day.”

There was a short, unpleasant pause. Then:--

“You ARE a nasty man, though, aren't you?” said Phyllis.

Peter took a step forward and knocked the man's hand up, so that the
shillings leapt out of it and rolled on the floor.

“If anything COULD make me sneak, THAT would!” he said. “Come, Phil,”
 and marched out of the signal-box with flaming cheeks.

Phyllis hesitated. Then she took the hand, still held out stupidly, that
the shillings had been in.

“I forgive you,” she said, “even if Peter doesn't. You're not in your
proper senses, or you'd never have done that. I know want of sleep sends
people mad. Mother told me. I hope your little boy will soon be better,
and--”

“Come on, Phil,” cried Peter, eagerly.

“I give you my sacred honour-word we'll never tell anyone. Kiss and be
friends,” said Phyllis, feeling how noble it was of her to try to make
up a quarrel in which she was not to blame.

The signalman stooped and kissed her.

“I do believe I'm a bit off my head, Sissy,” he said. “Now run along
home to Mother. I didn't mean to put you about--there.”

So Phil left the hot signal-box and followed Peter across the fields to
the farm.

When the farm men, led by Peter and Phyllis and carrying a hurdle
covered with horse-cloths, reached the manhole in the tunnel, Bobbie
was fast asleep and so was Jim. Worn out with the pain, the Doctor said
afterwards.

“Where does he live?” the bailiff from the farm asked, when Jim had been
lifted on to the hurdle.

“In Northumberland,” answered Bobbie.

“I'm at school at Maidbridge,” said Jim. “I suppose I've got to get back
there, somehow.”

“Seems to me the Doctor ought to have a look in first,” said the
bailiff.

“Oh, bring him up to our house,” said Bobbie. “It's only a little way by
the road. I'm sure Mother would say we ought to.”

“Will your Ma like you bringing home strangers with broken legs?”

“She took the poor Russian home herself,” said Bobbie. “I know she'd say
we ought.”

“All right,” said the bailiff, “you ought to know what your Ma 'ud like.
I wouldn't take it upon me to fetch him up to our place without I asked
the Missus first, and they call me the Master, too.”

“Are you sure your Mother won't mind?” whispered Jim.

“Certain,” said Bobbie.

“Then we're to take him up to Three Chimneys?” said the bailiff.

“Of course,” said Peter.

“Then my lad shall nip up to Doctor's on his bike, and tell him to come
down there. Now, lads, lift him quiet and steady. One, two, three!”

          *          *          *          *          *          *

Thus it happened that Mother, writing away for dear life at a story
about a Duchess, a designing villain, a secret passage, and a missing
will, dropped her pen as her work-room door burst open, and turned to
see Bobbie hatless and red with running.

“Oh, Mother,” she cried, “do come down. We found a hound in a red jersey
in the tunnel, and he's broken his leg and they're bringing him home.”

“They ought to take him to the vet,” said Mother, with a worried frown;
“I really CAN'T have a lame dog here.”

“He's not a dog, really--he's a boy,” said Bobbie, between laughing and
choking.

“Then he ought to be taken home to his mother.”

“His mother's dead,” said Bobbie, “and his father's in Northumberland.
Oh, Mother, you will be nice to him? I told him I was sure you'd want us
to bring him home. You always want to help everybody.”

Mother smiled, but she sighed, too. It is nice that your children should
believe you willing to open house and heart to any and every one who
needs help. But it is rather embarrassing sometimes, too, when they act
on their belief.

“Oh, well,” said Mother, “we must make the best of it.”

When Jim was carried in, dreadfully white and with set lips whose red
had faded to a horrid bluey violet colour, Mother said:--

“I am glad you brought him here. Now, Jim, let's get you comfortable in
bed before the Doctor comes!”

And Jim, looking at her kind eyes, felt a little, warm, comforting flush
of new courage.

“It'll hurt rather, won't it?” he said. “I don't mean to be a coward.
You won't think I'm a coward if I faint again, will you? I really
and truly don't do it on purpose. And I do hate to give you all this
trouble.”

“Don't you worry,” said Mother; “it's you that have the trouble, you
poor dear--not us.”

And she kissed him just as if he had been Peter. “We love to have you
here--don't we, Bobbie?”

“Yes,” said Bobbie--and she saw by her Mother's face how right she had
been to bring home the wounded hound in the red jersey.



Chapter XIII. The hound's grandfather.


Mother did not get back to her writing all that day, for the
red-jerseyed hound whom the children had brought to Three Chimneys had
to be put to bed. And then the Doctor came, and hurt him most horribly.
Mother was with him all through it, and that made it a little better
than it would have been, but “bad was the best,” as Mrs. Viney said.

The children sat in the parlour downstairs and heard the sound of the
Doctor's boots going backwards and forwards over the bedroom floor. And
once or twice there was a groan.

“It's horrible,” said Bobbie. “Oh, I wish Dr. Forrest would make haste.
Oh, poor Jim!”

“It IS horrible,” said Peter, “but it's very exciting. I wish Doctors
weren't so stuck-up about who they'll have in the room when they're
doing things. I should most awfully like to see a leg set. I believe the
bones crunch like anything.”

“Don't!” said the two girls at once.

“Rubbish!” said Peter. “How are you going to be Red Cross Nurses, like
you were talking of coming home, if you can't even stand hearing me say
about bones crunching? You'd have to HEAR them crunch on the field of
battle--and be steeped in gore up to the elbows as likely as not, and--”

“Stop it!” cried Bobbie, with a white face; “you don't know how funny
you're making me feel.”

“Me, too,” said Phyllis, whose face was pink.

“Cowards!” said Peter.

“I'm not,” said Bobbie. “I helped Mother with your rake-wounded foot,
and so did Phil--you know we did.”

“Well, then!” said Peter. “Now look here. It would be a jolly good thing
for you if I were to talk to you every day for half an hour about broken
bones and people's insides, so as to get you used to it.”

A chair was moved above.

“Listen,” said Peter, “that's the bone crunching.”

“I do wish you wouldn't,” said Phyllis. “Bobbie doesn't like it.”

“I'll tell you what they do,” said Peter. I can't think what made him so
horrid. Perhaps it was because he had been so very nice and kind all the
earlier part of the day, and now he had to have a change. This is called
reaction. One notices it now and then in oneself. Sometimes when one has
been extra good for a longer time than usual, one is suddenly attacked
by a violent fit of not being good at all. “I'll tell you what they do,”
 said Peter; “they strap the broken man down so that he can't resist or
interfere with their doctorish designs, and then someone holds his head,
and someone holds his leg--the broken one, and pulls it till the bones
fit in--with a crunch, mind you! Then they strap it up and--let's play
at bone-setting!”

“Oh, no!” said Phyllis.

But Bobbie said suddenly: “All right--LET'S! I'll be the doctor, and
Phil can be the nurse. You can be the broken boner; we can get at your
legs more easily, because you don't wear petticoats.”

“I'll get the splints and bandages,” said Peter; “you get the couch of
suffering ready.”

The ropes that had tied up the boxes that had come from home were all
in a wooden packing-case in the cellar. When Peter brought in a trailing
tangle of them, and two boards for splints, Phyllis was excitedly
giggling.

“Now, then,” he said, and lay down on the settle, groaning most
grievously.

“Not so loud!” said Bobbie, beginning to wind the rope round him and the
settle. “You pull, Phil.”

“Not so tight,” moaned Peter. “You'll break my other leg.”

Bobbie worked on in silence, winding more and more rope round him.

“That's enough,” said Peter. “I can't move at all. Oh, my poor leg!” He
groaned again.

“SURE you can't move?” asked Bobbie, in a rather strange tone.

“Quite sure,” replied Peter. “Shall we play it's bleeding freely or
not?” he asked cheerfully.

“YOU can play what you like,” said Bobbie, sternly, folding her arms and
looking down at him where he lay all wound round and round with cord.
“Phil and I are going away. And we shan't untie you till you promise
never, never to talk to us about blood and wounds unless we say you may.
Come, Phil!”

“You beast!” said Peter, writhing. “I'll never promise, never. I'll
yell, and Mother will come.”

“Do,” said Bobbie, “and tell her why we tied you up! Come on, Phil. No,
I'm not a beast, Peter. But you wouldn't stop when we asked you and--”

“Yah,” said Peter, “it wasn't even your own idea. You got it out of
Stalky!”

Bobbie and Phil, retiring in silent dignity, were met at the door by the
Doctor. He came in rubbing his hands and looking pleased with himself.

“Well,” he said, “THAT job's done. It's a nice clean fracture, and it'll
go on all right, I've no doubt. Plucky young chap, too--hullo! what's
all this?”

His eye had fallen on Peter who lay mousy-still in his bonds on the
settle.

“Playing at prisoners, eh?” he said; but his eyebrows had gone up a
little. Somehow he had not thought that Bobbie would be playing while in
the room above someone was having a broken bone set.

“Oh, no!” said Bobbie, “not at PRISONERS. We were playing at setting
bones. Peter's the broken boner, and I was the doctor.”

The Doctor frowned.

“Then I must say,” he said, and he said it rather sternly, “that's it's
a very heartless game. Haven't you enough imagination even to faintly
picture what's been going on upstairs? That poor chap, with the drops
of sweat on his forehead, and biting his lips so as not to cry out, and
every touch on his leg agony and--”

“YOU ought to be tied up,” said Phyllis; “you're as bad as--”

“Hush,” said Bobbie; “I'm sorry, but we weren't heartless, really.”

“I was, I suppose,” said Peter, crossly. “All right, Bobbie, don't you
go on being noble and screening me, because I jolly well won't have it.
It was only that I kept on talking about blood and wounds. I wanted to
train them for Red Cross Nurses. And I wouldn't stop when they asked
me.”

“Well?” said Dr. Forrest, sitting down.

“Well--then I said, 'Let's play at setting bones.' It was all rot. I
knew Bobbie wouldn't. I only said it to tease her. And then when she
said 'yes,' of course I had to go through with it. And they tied me up.
They got it out of Stalky. And I think it's a beastly shame.”

He managed to writhe over and hide his face against the wooden back of
the settle.

“I didn't think that anyone would know but us,” said Bobbie, indignantly
answering Peter's unspoken reproach. “I never thought of your coming in.
And hearing about blood and wounds does really make me feel most awfully
funny. It was only a joke our tying him up. Let me untie you, Pete.”

“I don't care if you never untie me,” said Peter; “and if that's your
idea of a joke--”

“If I were you,” said the Doctor, though really he did not quite know
what to say, “I should be untied before your Mother comes down. You
don't want to worry her just now, do you?”

“I don't promise anything about not saying about wounds, mind,” said
Peter, in very surly tones, as Bobbie and Phyllis began to untie the
knots.

“I'm very sorry, Pete,” Bobbie whispered, leaning close to him as she
fumbled with the big knot under the settle; “but if you only knew how
sick you made me feel.”

“You've made ME feel pretty sick, I can tell you,” Peter rejoined. Then
he shook off the loose cords, and stood up.

“I looked in,” said Dr. Forrest, “to see if one of you would come along
to the surgery. There are some things that your Mother will want at
once, and I've given my man a day off to go and see the circus; will you
come, Peter?”

Peter went without a word or a look to his sisters.

The two walked in silence up to the gate that led from the Three
Chimneys field to the road. Then Peter said:--

“Let me carry your bag. I say, it is heavy--what's in it?”

“Oh, knives and lancets and different instruments for hurting people.
And the ether bottle. I had to give him ether, you know--the agony was
so intense.”

Peter was silent.

“Tell me all about how you found that chap,” said Dr. Forrest.

Peter told. And then Dr. Forrest told him stories of brave rescues; he
was a most interesting man to talk to, as Peter had often remarked.

Then in the surgery Peter had a better chance than he had ever had of
examining the Doctor's balance, and his microscope, and his scales and
measuring glasses. When all the things were ready that Peter was to take
back, the Doctor said suddenly:--

“You'll excuse my shoving my oar in, won't you? But I should like to say
something to you.”

“Now for a rowing,” thought Peter, who had been wondering how it was
that he had escaped one.

“Something scientific,” added the Doctor.

“Yes,” said Peter, fiddling with the fossil ammonite that the Doctor
used for a paper-weight.

“Well then, you see. Boys and girls are only little men and women. And
WE are much harder and hardier than they are--” (Peter liked the “we.”
 Perhaps the Doctor had known he would.)--“and much stronger, and things
that hurt THEM don't hurt US. You know you mustn't hit a girl--”

“I should think not, indeed,” muttered Peter, indignantly.

“Not even if she's your own sister. That's because girls are so much
softer and weaker than we are; they have to be, you know,” he added,
“because if they weren't, it wouldn't be nice for the babies. And that's
why all the animals are so good to the mother animals. They never fight
them, you know.”

“I know,” said Peter, interested; “two buck rabbits will fight all day
if you let them, but they won't hurt a doe.”

“No; and quite wild beasts--lions and elephants--they're immensely
gentle with the female beasts. And we've got to be, too.”

“I see,” said Peter.

“And their hearts are soft, too,” the Doctor went on, “and things that
we shouldn't think anything of hurt them dreadfully. So that a man has
to be very careful, not only of his fists, but of his words. They're
awfully brave, you know,” he went on. “Think of Bobbie waiting alone in
the tunnel with that poor chap. It's an odd thing--the softer and more
easily hurt a woman is the better she can screw herself up to do what
HAS to be done. I've seen some brave women--your Mother's one,” he ended
abruptly.

“Yes,” said Peter.

“Well, that's all. Excuse my mentioning it. But nobody knows everything
without being told. And you see what I mean, don't you?”

“Yes,” said Peter. “I'm sorry. There!”

“Of course you are! People always are--directly they understand.
Everyone ought to be taught these scientific facts. So long!”

They shook hands heartily. When Peter came home, his sisters looked at
him doubtfully.

“It's Pax,” said Peter, dumping down the basket on the table. “Dr.
Forrest has been talking scientific to me. No, it's no use my telling
you what he said; you wouldn't understand. But it all comes to you girls
being poor, soft, weak, frightened things like rabbits, so us men have
just got to put up with them. He said you were female beasts. Shall I
take this up to Mother, or will you?”

“I know what BOYS are,” said Phyllis, with flaming cheeks; “they're just
the nastiest, rudest--”

“They're very brave,” said Bobbie, “sometimes.”

“Ah, you mean the chap upstairs? I see. Go ahead, Phil--I shall put
up with you whatever you say because you're a poor, weak, frightened,
soft--”

“Not if I pull your hair you won't,” said Phyllis, springing at him.

“He said 'Pax,'” said Bobbie, pulling her away. “Don't you see,” she
whispered as Peter picked up the basket and stalked out with it, “he's
sorry, really, only he won't say so? Let's say we're sorry.”

“It's so goody goody,” said Phyllis, doubtfully; “he said we were female
beasts, and soft and frightened--”

“Then let's show him we're not frightened of him thinking us goody
goody,” said Bobbie; “and we're not any more beasts than he is.”

And when Peter came back, still with his chin in the air, Bobbie said:--

“We're sorry we tied you up, Pete.”

“I thought you would be,” said Peter, very stiff and superior.

This was hard to bear. But--

“Well, so we are,” said Bobbie. “Now let honour be satisfied on both
sides.”

“I did call it Pax,” said Peter, in an injured tone.

“Then let it BE Pax,” said Bobbie. “Come on, Phil, let's get the tea.
Pete, you might lay the cloth.”

“I say,” said Phyllis, when peace was really restored, which was not
till they were washing up the cups after tea, “Dr. Forrest didn't REALLY
say we were female beasts, did he?”

“Yes,” said Peter, firmly, “but I think he meant we men were wild
beasts, too.”

“How funny of him!” said Phyllis, breaking a cup.

          *          *          *          *          *          *

“May I come in, Mother?” Peter was at the door of Mother's writing room,
where Mother sat at her table with two candles in front of her. Their
flames looked orange and violet against the clear grey blue of the sky
where already a few stars were twinkling.

“Yes, dear,” said Mother, absently, “anything wrong?” She wrote a few
more words and then laid down her pen and began to fold up what she had
written. “I was just writing to Jim's grandfather. He lives near here,
you know.”

“Yes, you said so at tea. That's what I want to say. Must you write to
him, Mother? Couldn't we keep Jim, and not say anything to his people
till he's well? It would be such a surprise for them.”

“Well, yes,” said Mother, laughing, “I think it would.”

“You see,” Peter went on, “of course the girls are all right and all
that--I'm not saying anything against THEM. But I should like it if I
had another chap to talk to sometimes.”

“Yes,” said Mother, “I know it's dull for you, dear. But I can't
help it. Next year perhaps I can send you to school--you'd like that,
wouldn't you?”

“I do miss the other chaps, rather,” Peter confessed; “but if Jim could
stay after his leg was well, we could have awful larks.”

“I've no doubt of it,” said Mother. “Well--perhaps he could, but you
know, dear, we're not rich. I can't afford to get him everything he'll
want. And he must have a nurse.”

“Can't you nurse him, Mother? You do nurse people so beautifully.”

“That's a pretty compliment, Pete--but I can't do nursing and my writing
as well. That's the worst of it.”

“Then you MUST send the letter to his grandfather?”

“Of course--and to his schoolmaster, too. We telegraphed to them both,
but I must write as well. They'll be most dreadfully anxious.”

“I say, Mother, why can't his grandfather pay for a nurse?” Peter
suggested. “That would be ripping. I expect the old boy's rolling in
money. Grandfathers in books always are.”

“Well, this one isn't in a book,” said Mother, “so we mustn't expect him
to roll much.”

“I say,” said Peter, musingly, “wouldn't it be jolly if we all WERE in
a book, and you were writing it? Then you could make all sorts of jolly
things happen, and make Jim's legs get well at once and be all right
to-morrow, and Father come home soon and--”

“Do you miss your Father very much?” Mother asked, rather coldly, Peter
thought.

“Awfully,” said Peter, briefly.

Mother was enveloping and addressing the second letter.

“You see,” Peter went on slowly, “you see, it's not only him BEING
Father, but now he's away there's no other man in the house but
me--that's why I want Jim to stay so frightfully much. Wouldn't you like
to be writing that book with us all in it, Mother, and make Daddy come
home soon?”

Peter's Mother put her arm round him suddenly, and hugged him in silence
for a minute. Then she said:--

“Don't you think it's rather nice to think that we're in a book that
God's writing? If I were writing the book, I might make mistakes. But
God knows how to make the story end just right--in the way that's best
for us.”

“Do you really believe that, Mother?” Peter asked quietly.

“Yes,” she said, “I do believe it--almost always--except when I'm so sad
that I can't believe anything. But even when I can't believe it, I know
it's true--and I try to believe. You don't know how I try, Peter. Now
take the letters to the post, and don't let's be sad any more. Courage,
courage! That's the finest of all the virtues! I dare say Jim will be
here for two or three weeks yet.”

For what was left of the evening Peter was so angelic that Bobbie feared
he was going to be ill. She was quite relieved in the morning to find
him plaiting Phyllis's hair on to the back of her chair in quite his old
manner.

It was soon after breakfast that a knock came at the door. The children
were hard at work cleaning the brass candlesticks in honour of Jim's
visit.

“That'll be the Doctor,” said Mother; “I'll go. Shut the kitchen
door--you're not fit to be seen.”

But it wasn't the Doctor. They knew that by the voice and by the sound
of the boots that went upstairs. They did not recognise the sound of the
boots, but everyone was certain that they had heard the voice before.

There was a longish interval. The boots and the voice did not come down
again.

“Who can it possibly be?” they kept on asking themselves and each other.

“Perhaps,” said Peter at last, “Dr. Forrest has been attacked by
highwaymen and left for dead, and this is the man he's telegraphed for
to take his place. Mrs. Viney said he had a local tenant to do his work
when he went for a holiday, didn't you, Mrs. Viney?”

“I did so, my dear,” said Mrs. Viney from the back kitchen.

“He's fallen down in a fit, more likely,” said Phyllis, “all human aid
despaired of. And this is his man come to break the news to Mother.”

“Nonsense!” said Peter, briskly; “Mother wouldn't have taken the man
up into Jim's bedroom. Why should she? Listen--the door's opening. Now
they'll come down. I'll open the door a crack.”

He did.

“It's not listening,” he replied indignantly to Bobbie's scandalised
remarks; “nobody in their senses would talk secrets on the stairs. And
Mother can't have secrets to talk with Dr. Forrest's stable-man--and you
said it was him.”

“Bobbie,” called Mother's voice.

They opened the kitchen door, and Mother leaned over the stair railing.

“Jim's grandfather has come,” she said; “wash your hands and faces and
then you can see him. He wants to see you!” The bedroom door shut again.

“There now!” said Peter; “fancy us not even thinking of that! Let's have
some hot water, Mrs. Viney. I'm as black as your hat.”

The three were indeed dirty, for the stuff you clean brass candlesticks
with is very far from cleaning to the cleaner.

They were still busy with soap and flannel when they heard the boots
and the voice come down the stairs and go into the dining-room. And when
they were clean, though still damp--because it takes such a long time
to dry your hands properly, and they were very impatient to see the
grandfather--they filed into the dining-room.

Mother was sitting in the window-seat, and in the leather-covered
armchair that Father always used to sit in at the other house sat--

     THEIR OWN OLD GENTLEMAN!

“Well, I never did,” said Peter, even before he said, “How do you do?”
 He was, as he explained afterwards, too surprised even to remember that
there was such a thing as politeness--much less to practise it.

“It's our own old gentleman!” said Phyllis.

“Oh, it's you!” said Bobbie. And then they remembered themselves and
their manners and said, “How do you do?” very nicely.

“This is Jim's grandfather, Mr. ----” said Mother, naming the old
gentleman's name.

“How splendid!” said Peter; “that's just exactly like a book, isn't it,
Mother?”

“It is, rather,” said Mother, smiling; “things do happen in real life
that are rather like books, sometimes.”

“I am so awfully glad it IS you,” said Phyllis; “when you think of the
tons of old gentlemen there are in the world--it might have been almost
anyone.”

“I say, though,” said Peter, “you're not going to take Jim away, though,
are you?”

“Not at present,” said the old gentleman. “Your Mother has most kindly
consented to let him stay here. I thought of sending a nurse, but your
Mother is good enough to say that she will nurse him herself.”

“But what about her writing?” said Peter, before anyone could stop him.
“There won't be anything for him to eat if Mother doesn't write.”

“That's all right,” said Mother, hastily.

The old gentleman looked very kindly at Mother.

“I see,” he said, “you trust your children, and confide in them.”

“Of course,” said Mother.

“Then I may tell them of our little arrangement,” he said. “Your Mother,
my dears, has consented to give up writing for a little while and to
become a Matron of my Hospital.”

“Oh!” said Phyllis, blankly; “and shall we have to go away from Three
Chimneys and the Railway and everything?”

“No, no, darling,” said Mother, hurriedly.

“The Hospital is called Three Chimneys Hospital,” said the old
gentleman, “and my unlucky Jim's the only patient, and I hope he'll
continue to be so. Your Mother will be Matron, and there'll be a
hospital staff of a housemaid and a cook--till Jim's well.”

“And then will Mother go on writing again?” asked Peter.

“We shall see,” said the old gentleman, with a slight, swift glance at
Bobbie; “perhaps something nice may happen and she won't have to.”

“I love my writing,” said Mother, very quickly.

“I know,” said the old gentleman; “don't be afraid that I'm going to try
to interfere. But one never knows. Very wonderful and beautiful things
do happen, don't they? And we live most of our lives in the hope of
them. I may come again to see the boy?”

“Surely,” said Mother, “and I don't know how to thank you for making it
possible for me to nurse him. Dear boy!”

“He kept calling Mother, Mother, in the night,” said Phyllis. “I woke up
twice and heard him.”

“He didn't mean me,” said Mother, in a low voice to the old gentleman;
“that's why I wanted so much to keep him.”

The old gentleman rose.

“I'm so glad,” said Peter, “that you're going to keep him, Mother.”

“Take care of your Mother, my dears,” said the old gentleman. “She's a
woman in a million.”

“Yes, isn't she?” whispered Bobbie.

“God bless her,” said the old gentleman, taking both Mother's hands,
“God bless her! Ay, and she shall be blessed. Dear me, where's my hat?
Will Bobbie come with me to the gate?”

At the gate he stopped and said:--

“You're a good child, my dear--I got your letter. But it wasn't needed.
When I read about your Father's case in the papers at the time, I had my
doubts. And ever since I've known who you were, I've been trying to find
out things. I haven't done very much yet. But I have hopes, my dear--I
have hopes.”

“Oh!” said Bobbie, choking a little.

“Yes--I may say great hopes. But keep your secret a little longer.
Wouldn't do to upset your Mother with a false hope, would it?”

“Oh, but it isn't false!” said Bobbie; “I KNOW you can do it. I knew you
could when I wrote. It isn't a false hope, is it?”

“No,” he said, “I don't think it's a false hope, or I wouldn't have told
you. And I think you deserve to be told that there IS a hope.”

“And you don't think Father did it, do you? Oh, say you don't think he
did.”

“My dear,” he said, “I'm perfectly CERTAIN he didn't.”

If it was a false hope, it was none the less a very radiant one that lay
warm at Bobbie's heart, and through the days that followed lighted her
little face as a Japanese lantern is lighted by the candle within.



Chapter XIV. The End.


Life at the Three Chimneys was never quite the same again after the old
gentleman came to see his grandson. Although they now knew his name,
the children never spoke of him by it--at any rate, when they were by
themselves. To them he was always the old gentleman, and I think he had
better be the old gentleman to us, too. It wouldn't make him seem any
more real to you, would it, if I were to tell you that his name was
Snooks or Jenkins (which it wasn't)?--and, after all, I must be allowed
to keep one secret. It's the only one; I have told you everything else,
except what I am going to tell you in this chapter, which is the last.
At least, of course, I haven't told you EVERYTHING. If I were to do
that, the book would never come to an end, and that would be a pity,
wouldn't it?

Well, as I was saying, life at Three Chimneys was never quite the same
again. The cook and the housemaid were very nice (I don't mind telling
you their names--they were Clara and Ethelwyn), but they told Mother
they did not seem to want Mrs. Viney, and that she was an old muddler.
So Mrs. Viney came only two days a week to do washing and ironing. Then
Clara and Ethelwyn said they could do the work all right if they weren't
interfered with, and that meant that the children no longer got the tea
and cleared it away and washed up the tea-things and dusted the rooms.

This would have left quite a blank in their lives, although they
had often pretended to themselves and to each other that they hated
housework. But now that Mother had no writing and no housework to do,
she had time for lessons. And lessons the children had to do. However
nice the person who is teaching you may be, lessons are lessons all the
world over, and at their best are worse fun than peeling potatoes or
lighting a fire.

On the other hand, if Mother now had time for lessons, she also had time
for play, and to make up little rhymes for the children as she used
to do. She had not had much time for rhymes since she came to Three
Chimneys.

There was one very odd thing about these lessons. Whatever the children
were doing, they always wanted to be doing something else. When Peter
was doing his Latin, he thought it would be nice to be learning History
like Bobbie. Bobbie would have preferred Arithmetic, which was what
Phyllis happened to be doing, and Phyllis of course thought Latin much
the most interesting kind of lesson. And so on.

So, one day, when they sat down to lessons, each of them found a little
rhyme at its place. I put the rhymes in to show you that their Mother
really did understand a little how children feel about things, and also
the kind of words they use, which is the case with very few grown-up
people. I suppose most grown-ups have very bad memories, and have
forgotten how they felt when they were little. Of course, the verses are
supposed to be spoken by the children.

               PETER

     I once thought Caesar easy pap--
       How very soft I must have been!
     When they start Caesar with a chap
       He little know what that will mean.
     Oh, verbs are silly stupid things.
     I'd rather learn the dates of kings!

               BOBBIE

     The worst of all my lesson things
       Is learning who succeeded who
     In all the rows of queens and kings,
       With dates to everything they do:
     With dates enough to make you sick;--
     I wish it was Arithmetic!

               PHYLLIS

     Such pounds and pounds of apples fill
       My slate--what is the price you'd spend?
     You scratch the figures out until
       You cry upon the dividend.
     I'd break the slate and scream for joy
     If I did Latin like a boy!

This kind of thing, of course, made lessons much jollier. It is
something to know that the person who is teaching you sees that it is
not all plain sailing for you, and does not think that it is just your
stupidness that makes you not know your lessons till you've learned
them!

Then as Jim's leg got better it was very pleasant to go up and sit with
him and hear tales about his school life and the other boys. There
was one boy, named Parr, of whom Jim seemed to have formed the lowest
possible opinion, and another boy named Wigsby Minor, for whose views
Jim had a great respect. Also there were three brothers named Paley, and
the youngest was called Paley Terts, and was much given to fighting.

Peter drank in all this with deep joy, and Mother seemed to have
listened with some interest, for one day she gave Jim a sheet of paper
on which she had written a rhyme about Parr, bringing in Paley and
Wigsby by name in a most wonderful way, as well as all the reasons Jim
had for not liking Parr, and Wigsby's wise opinion on the matter. Jim
was immensely pleased. He had never had a rhyme written expressly for
him before. He read it till he knew it by heart and then he sent it to
Wigsby, who liked it almost as much as Jim did. Perhaps you may like it,
too.

               THE NEW BOY

     His name is Parr:  he says that he
     Is given bread and milk for tea.
     He says his father killed a bear.
     He says his mother cuts his hair.

     He wears goloshes when it's wet.
     I've heard his people call him “Pet”!
     He has no proper sense of shame;
     He told the chaps his Christian name.

     He cannot wicket-keep at all,
     He's frightened of a cricket ball.
     He reads indoors for hours and hours.
     He knows the names of beastly flowers.

     He says his French just like Mossoo--
     A beastly stuck-up thing to do--
     He won't keep _cave_, shirks his turn
     And says he came to school to learn!

     He won't play football, says it hurts;
     He wouldn't fight with Paley Terts;
     He couldn't whistle if he tried,
     And when we laughed at him he cried!

     Now Wigsby Minor says that Parr
     Is only like all new boys are.
     I know when _I_ first came to school
     I wasn't such a jolly fool!

Jim could never understand how Mother could have been clever enough
to do it. To the others it seemed nice, but natural. You see they had
always been used to having a mother who could write verses just like
the way people talk, even to the shocking expression at the end of the
rhyme, which was Jim's very own.

Jim taught Peter to play chess and draughts and dominoes, and altogether
it was a nice quiet time.

Only Jim's leg got better and better, and a general feeling began to
spring up among Bobbie, Peter, and Phyllis that something ought to be
done to amuse him; not just games, but something really handsome. But it
was extraordinarily difficult to think of anything.

“It's no good,” said Peter, when all of them had thought and thought
till their heads felt quite heavy and swollen; “if we can't think of
anything to amuse him, we just can't, and there's an end of it. Perhaps
something will just happen of its own accord that he'll like.”

“Things DO happen by themselves sometimes, without your making them,”
 said Phyllis, rather as though, usually, everything that happened in the
world was her doing.

“I wish something would happen,” said Bobbie, dreamily, “something
wonderful.”

And something wonderful did happen exactly four days after she had said
this. I wish I could say it was three days after, because in fairy tales
it is always three days after that things happen. But this is not a
fairy story, and besides, it really was four and not three, and I am
nothing if not strictly truthful.

They seemed to be hardly Railway children at all in those days, and as
the days went on each had an uneasy feeling about this which Phyllis
expressed one day.

“I wonder if the Railway misses us,” she said, plaintively. “We never go
to see it now.”

“It seems ungrateful,” said Bobbie; “we loved it so when we hadn't
anyone else to play with.”

“Perks is always coming up to ask after Jim,” said Peter, “and the
signalman's little boy is better. He told me so.”

“I didn't mean the people,” explained Phyllis; “I meant the dear Railway
itself.”

“The thing I don't like,” said Bobbie, on this fourth day, which was a
Tuesday, “is our having stopped waving to the 9.15 and sending our love
to Father by it.”

“Let's begin again,” said Phyllis. And they did.

Somehow the change of everything that was made by having servants in
the house and Mother not doing any writing, made the time seem extremely
long since that strange morning at the beginning of things, when they
had got up so early and burnt the bottom out of the kettle and had apple
pie for breakfast and first seen the Railway.

It was September now, and the turf on the slope to the Railway was dry
and crisp. Little long grass spikes stood up like bits of gold wire,
frail blue harebells trembled on their tough, slender stalks, Gipsy
roses opened wide and flat their lilac-coloured discs, and the golden
stars of St. John's Wort shone at the edges of the pool that lay halfway
to the Railway. Bobbie gathered a generous handful of the flowers and
thought how pretty they would look lying on the green-and-pink blanket
of silk-waste that now covered Jim's poor broken leg.

“Hurry up,” said Peter, “or we shall miss the 9.15!”

“I can't hurry more than I am doing,” said Phyllis. “Oh, bother it! My
bootlace has come undone AGAIN!”

“When you're married,” said Peter, “your bootlace will come undone going
up the church aisle, and your man that you're going to get married to
will tumble over it and smash his nose in on the ornamented pavement;
and then you'll say you won't marry him, and you'll have to be an old
maid.”

“I shan't,” said Phyllis. “I'd much rather marry a man with his nose
smashed in than not marry anybody.”

“It would be horrid to marry a man with a smashed nose, all the same,”
 went on Bobbie. “He wouldn't be able to smell the flowers at the
wedding. Wouldn't that be awful!”

“Bother the flowers at the wedding!” cried Peter. “Look! the signal's
down. We must run!”

They ran. And once more they waved their handkerchiefs, without at all
minding whether the handkerchiefs were clean or not, to the 9.15.

“Take our love to Father!” cried Bobbie. And the others, too, shouted:--

“Take our love to Father!”

The old gentleman waved from his first-class carriage window. Quite
violently he waved. And there was nothing odd in that, for he always
had waved. But what was really remarkable was that from every window
handkerchiefs fluttered, newspapers signalled, hands waved wildly. The
train swept by with a rustle and roar, the little pebbles jumped and
danced under it as it passed, and the children were left looking at each
other.

“Well!” said Peter.

“WELL!” said Bobbie.

“_WELL!_” said Phyllis.

“Whatever on earth does that mean?” asked Peter, but he did not expect
any answer.

“_I_ don't know,” said Bobbie. “Perhaps the old gentleman told the
people at his station to look out for us and wave. He knew we should
like it!”

Now, curiously enough, this was just what had happened. The old
gentleman, who was very well known and respected at his particular
station, had got there early that morning, and he had waited at the door
where the young man stands holding the interesting machine that clips
the tickets, and he had said something to every single passenger who
passed through that door. And after nodding to what the old gentleman
had said--and the nods expressed every shade of surprise, interest,
doubt, cheerful pleasure, and grumpy agreement--each passenger had gone
on to the platform and read one certain part of his newspaper. And when
the passengers got into the train, they had told the other passengers
who were already there what the old gentleman had said, and then the
other passengers had also looked at their newspapers and seemed very
astonished and, mostly, pleased. Then, when the train passed the fence
where the three children were, newspapers and hands and handkerchiefs
were waved madly, till all that side of the train was fluttery with
white like the pictures of the King's Coronation in the biograph at
Maskelyne and Cook's. To the children it almost seemed as though the
train itself was alive, and was at last responding to the love that they
had given it so freely and so long.

“It is most extraordinarily rum!” said Peter.

“Most stronery!” echoed Phyllis.

But Bobbie said, “Don't you think the old gentleman's waves seemed more
significating than usual?”

“No,” said the others.

“I do,” said Bobbie. “I thought he was trying to explain something to us
with his newspaper.”

“Explain what?” asked Peter, not unnaturally.

“_I_ don't know,” Bobbie answered, “but I do feel most awfully funny. I
feel just exactly as if something was going to happen.”

“What is going to happen,” said Peter, “is that Phyllis's stocking is
going to come down.”

This was but too true. The suspender had given way in the agitation of
the waves to the 9.15. Bobbie's handkerchief served as first aid to the
injured, and they all went home.

Lessons were more than usually difficult to Bobbie that day. Indeed, she
disgraced herself so deeply over a quite simple sum about the division
of 48 pounds of meat and 36 pounds of bread among 144 hungry children
that Mother looked at her anxiously.

“Don't you feel quite well, dear?” she asked.

“I don't know,” was Bobbie's unexpected answer. “I don't know how
I feel. It isn't that I'm lazy. Mother, will you let me off lessons
to-day? I feel as if I wanted to be quite alone by myself.”

“Yes, of course I'll let you off,” said Mother; “but--”

Bobbie dropped her slate. It cracked just across the little green mark
that is so useful for drawing patterns round, and it was never the same
slate again. Without waiting to pick it up she bolted. Mother caught her
in the hall feeling blindly among the waterproofs and umbrellas for her
garden hat.

“What is it, my sweetheart?” said Mother. “You don't feel ill, do you?”

“I DON'T know,” Bobbie answered, a little breathlessly, “but I want to
be by myself and see if my head really IS all silly and my inside all
squirmy-twisty.”

“Hadn't you better lie down?” Mother said, stroking her hair back from
her forehead.

“I'd be more alive in the garden, I think,” said Bobbie.

But she could not stay in the garden. The hollyhocks and the asters and
the late roses all seemed to be waiting for something to happen. It was
one of those still, shiny autumn days, when everything does seem to be
waiting.

Bobbie could not wait.

“I'll go down to the station,” she said, “and talk to Perks and ask
about the signalman's little boy.”

So she went down. On the way she passed the old lady from the
Post-office, who gave her a kiss and a hug, but, rather to Bobbie's
surprise, no words except:--

“God bless you, love--” and, after a pause, “run along--do.”

The draper's boy, who had sometimes been a little less than civil and
a little more than contemptuous, now touched his cap, and uttered the
remarkable words:--

“'Morning, Miss, I'm sure--”

The blacksmith, coming along with an open newspaper in his hand, was
even more strange in his manner. He grinned broadly, though, as a rule,
he was a man not given to smiles, and waved the newspaper long before
he came up to her. And as he passed her, he said, in answer to her “Good
morning”:--

“Good morning to you, Missie, and many of them! I wish you joy, that I
do!”

“Oh!” said Bobbie to herself, and her heart quickened its beats,
“something IS going to happen! I know it is--everyone is so odd, like
people are in dreams.”

The Station Master wrung her hand warmly. In fact he worked it up and
down like a pump-handle. But he gave her no reason for this unusually
enthusiastic greeting. He only said:--

“The 11.54's a bit late, Miss--the extra luggage this holiday time,”
 and went away very quickly into that inner Temple of his into which even
Bobbie dared not follow him.

Perks was not to be seen, and Bobbie shared the solitude of the platform
with the Station Cat. This tortoiseshell lady, usually of a retiring
disposition, came to-day to rub herself against the brown stockings of
Bobbie with arched back, waving tail, and reverberating purrs.

“Dear me!” said Bobbie, stooping to stroke her, “how very kind everybody
is to-day--even you, Pussy!”

Perks did not appear until the 11.54 was signalled, and then he, like
everybody else that morning, had a newspaper in his hand.

“Hullo!” he said, “'ere you are. Well, if THIS is the train, it'll be
smart work! Well, God bless you, my dear! I see it in the paper, and
I don't think I was ever so glad of anything in all my born days!” He
looked at Bobbie a moment, then said, “One I must have, Miss, and no
offence, I know, on a day like this 'ere!” and with that he kissed her,
first on one cheek and then on the other.

“You ain't offended, are you?” he asked anxiously. “I ain't took too
great a liberty? On a day like this, you know--”

“No, no,” said Bobbie, “of course it's not a liberty, dear Mr. Perks;
we love you quite as much as if you were an uncle of ours--but--on a day
like WHAT?”

“Like this 'ere!” said Perks. “Don't I tell you I see it in the paper?”

“Saw WHAT in the paper?” asked Bobbie, but already the 11.54 was
steaming into the station and the Station Master was looking at all the
places where Perks was not and ought to have been.

Bobbie was left standing alone, the Station Cat watching her from under
the bench with friendly golden eyes.

Of course you know already exactly what was going to happen. Bobbie was
not so clever. She had the vague, confused, expectant feeling that comes
to one's heart in dreams. What her heart expected I can't tell--perhaps
the very thing that you and I know was going to happen--but her mind
expected nothing; it was almost blank, and felt nothing but tiredness
and stupidness and an empty feeling, like your body has when you have
been a long walk and it is very far indeed past your proper dinner-time.

Only three people got out of the 11.54. The first was a countryman with
two baskety boxes full of live chickens who stuck their russet heads
out anxiously through the wicker bars; the second was Miss Peckitt, the
grocer's wife's cousin, with a tin box and three brown-paper parcels;
and the third--

“Oh! my Daddy, my Daddy!” That scream went like a knife into the heart
of everyone in the train, and people put their heads out of the windows
to see a tall pale man with lips set in a thin close line, and a little
girl clinging to him with arms and legs, while his arms went tightly
round her.

         *          *          *          *          *          *

“I knew something wonderful was going to happen,” said Bobbie, as they
went up the road, “but I didn't think it was going to be this. Oh, my
Daddy, my Daddy!”

“Then didn't Mother get my letter?” Father asked.

“There weren't any letters this morning. Oh! Daddy! it IS really you,
isn't it?”

The clasp of a hand she had not forgotten assured her that it was. “You
must go in by yourself, Bobbie, and tell Mother quite quietly that it's
all right. They've caught the man who did it. Everyone knows now that it
wasn't your Daddy.”

“_I_ always knew it wasn't,” said Bobbie. “Me and Mother and our old
gentleman.”

“Yes,” he said, “it's all his doing. Mother wrote and told me you had
found out. And she told me what you'd been to her. My own little girl!”
 They stopped a minute then.

And now I see them crossing the field. Bobbie goes into the house,
trying to keep her eyes from speaking before her lips have found the
right words to “tell Mother quite quietly” that the sorrow and the
struggle and the parting are over and done, and that Father has come
home.

I see Father walking in the garden, waiting--waiting. He is looking at
the flowers, and each flower is a miracle to eyes that all these months
of Spring and Summer have seen only flagstones and gravel and a little
grudging grass. But his eyes keep turning towards the house. And
presently he leaves the garden and goes to stand outside the nearest
door. It is the back door, and across the yard the swallows are
circling. They are getting ready to fly away from cold winds and keen
frost to the land where it is always summer. They are the same swallows
that the children built the little clay nests for.

Now the house door opens. Bobbie's voice calls:--

“Come in, Daddy; come in!”

He goes in and the door is shut. I think we will not open the door or
follow him. I think that just now we are not wanted there. I think it
will be best for us to go quickly and quietly away. At the end of the
field, among the thin gold spikes of grass and the harebells and Gipsy
roses and St. John's Wort, we may just take one last look, over our
shoulders, at the white house where neither we nor anyone else is wanted
now.

I. The Book of Beasts


He happened to be building a Palace when the news came, and he left all
the bricks kicking about the floor for Nurse to clear up--but then the
news was rather remarkable news. You see, there was a knock at the front
door and voices talking downstairs, and Lionel thought it was the man
come to see about the gas, which had not been allowed to be lighted
since the day when Lionel made a swing by tying his skipping rope to the
gas bracket.

And then, quite suddenly, Nurse came in and said, "Master Lionel, dear,
they've come to fetch you to go and be King."

Then she made haste to change his smock and to wash his face and hands
and brush his hair, and all the time she was doing it Lionel kept
wriggling and fidgeting and saying, "Oh, don't, Nurse," and, "I'm sure
my ears are quite clean," or, "Never mind my hair, it's all right," and,
"That'll do."

"You're going on as if you was going to be an eel instead of a King,"
said Nurse.

The minute Nurse let go for a moment Lionel bolted off without waiting
for his clean handkerchief, and in the drawing room there were two very
grave-looking gentlemen in red robes with fur, and gold coronets with
velvet sticking up out of the middle like the cream in the very
expensive jam tarts.

They bowed low to Lionel, and the gravest one said: "Sire, your
great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, the King of this country, is
dead, and now you have got to come and be King."

"Yes, please, sir," said Lionel, "when does it begin?"

"You will be crowned this afternoon," said the grave gentleman who was
not quite so grave-looking as the other.

"Would you like me to bring Nurse, or what time would you like me to be
fetched, and hadn't I better put on my velvet suit with the lace
collar?" said Lionel, who had often been out to tea.

"Your Nurse will be removed to the Palace later. No, never mind about
changing your suit; the Royal robes will cover all that up."

The grave gentlemen led the way to a coach with eight white horses,
which was drawn up in front of the house where Lionel lived. It was No.
7, on the left-hand side of the street as you go up.

Lionel ran upstairs at the last minute, and he kissed Nurse and said:
"Thank you for washing me. I wish I'd let you do the other ear.
No--there's no time now. Give me the hanky. Good-bye, Nurse."

"Good-bye, ducky," said Nurse. "Be a good little King now, and say
'please' and 'thank you,' and remember to pass the cake to the little
girls, and don't have more than two helps of anything."

So off went Lionel to be made a King. He had never expected to be a King
any more than you have, so it was all quite new to him--so new that he
had never even thought of it. And as the coach went through the town he
had to bite his tongue to be quite sure it was real, because if his
tongue was real it showed he wasn't dreaming. Half an hour before he had
been building with bricks in the nursery; and now--the streets were all
fluttering with flags; every window was crowded with people waving
handkerchiefs and scattering flowers; there were scarlet soldiers
everywhere along the pavements, and all the bells of all the churches
were ringing like mad, and like a great song to the music of their
ringing he heard thousands of people shouting, "Long live Lionel! Long
live our little King!"

He was a little sorry at first that he had not put on his best clothes,
but he soon forgot to think about that. If he had been a girl he would
very likely have bothered about it the whole time.

As they went along, the grave gentlemen, who were the Chancellor and the
Prime Minister, explained the things which Lionel did not understand.

"I thought we were a Republic," said Lionel. "I'm sure there hasn't been
a King for some time."

"Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather's death happened
when my grandfather was a little boy," said the Prime Minister, "and
since then your loyal people have been saving up to buy you a crown--so
much a week, you know, according to people's means--sixpence a week from
those who have first-rate pocket money, down to a halfpenny a week from
those who haven't so much. You know it's the rule that the crown must be
paid for by the people."

"But hadn't my great-great-however-much-it-is-grandfather a crown?"

"Yes, but he sent it to be tinned over, for fear of vanity, and he had
had all the jewels taken out, and sold them to buy books. He was a
strange man; a very good King he was, but he had his faults--he was fond
of books. Almost with his last breath he sent the crown to be
tinned--and he never lived to pay the tinsmith's bill."

Here the Prime Minister wiped away a tear, and just then the carriage
stopped and Lionel was taken out of the carriage to be crowned. Being
crowned is much more tiring work than you would suppose, and by the time
it was over, and Lionel had worn the Royal robes for an hour or two and
had had his hand kissed by everybody whose business it was to do it, he
was quite worn out, and was very glad to get into the Palace nursery.

Nurse was there, and tea was ready: seedy cake and plummy cake, and jam
and hot buttered toast, and the prettiest china with red and gold and
blue flowers on it, and real tea, and as many cups of it as you liked.

After tea Lionel said: "I think I should like a book. Will you get me
one, Nurse?"

"Bless the child," said Nurse. "You don't suppose you've lost the use of
your legs with just being a King? Run along, do, and get your books
yourself."

So Lionel went down into the library. The Prime Minister and the
Chancellor were there, and when Lionel came in they bowed very low, and
were beginning to ask Lionel most politely what on earth he was coming
bothering for now--when Lionel cried out: "Oh, what a worldful of books!
Are they yours?"

"They are yours, Your Majesty," answered the Chancellor. "They were the
property of the late King, your great-great--"

"Yes, I know," Lionel interrupted. "Well, I shall read them all. I love
to read. I am so glad I learned to read."

"If I might venture to advise Your Majesty," said the Prime Minister, "I
should not read these books. Your great--"

"Yes?" said Lionel, quickly.

"He was a very good King--oh, yes, really a very superior King in his
way, but he was a little--well, strange."

"Mad?" asked Lionel, cheerfully.

"No, no"--both the gentlemen were sincerely shocked. "Not mad; but if I
may express it so, he was--er--too clever by half. And I should not like
a little King of mine to have anything to do with his books."

Lionel looked puzzled.

"The fact is," the Chancellor went on, twisting his red beard in an
agitated way, "your great--"

"Go on," said Lionel.

"--was called a wizard."

"But he wasn't?"

"Of course not--a most worthy King was your great--"

"I see."

"But I wouldn't touch his books."

"Just this one," cried Lionel, laying his hands on the cover of a great
brown book that lay on the study table. It had gold patterns on the
brown leather, and gold clasps with turquoises and rubies in the twists
of them, and gold corners, so that the leather should not wear out too
quickly.

"I must look at this one," Lionel said, for on the back in big letters
he read: _The Book of Beasts_.

The Chancellor said, "Don't be a silly little King."

But Lionel had got the gold clasps undone, and he opened the first page,
and there was a beautiful Butterfly all red, and brown, and yellow, and
blue, so beautifully painted that it looked as if it were alive.

"There," said Lionel, "Isn't that lovely? Why--"

But as he spoke the beautiful Butterfly fluttered its many-colored wings
on the yellow old page of the book, and flew up and out of the window.

"Well!" said the Prime Minister, as soon as he could speak for the lump
of wonder that had got into his throat and tried to choke him, "that's
magic, that is."

But before he had spoken, the King had turned the next page, and there
was a shining bird complete and beautiful in every blue feather of him.
Under him was written, "Blue Bird of Paradise," and while the King gazed
enchanted at the charming picture the Blue Bird fluttered his wings on
the yellow page and spread them and flew out of the book.

Then the Prime Minister snatched the book away from the King and shut it
up on the blank page where the bird had been, and put it on a very high
shelf. And the Chancellor gave the King a good shaking, and said:
"You're a naughty, disobedient little King!" and was very angry indeed.

"I don't see that I've done any harm," said Lionel. He hated being
shaken, as all boys do; he would much rather have been slapped.

"No harm?" said the Chancellor. "Ah--but what do you know about it?
That's the question. How do you know what might have been on the next
page--a snake or a worm, or a centipede or a revolutionist, or
something like that."

"Well, I'm sorry if I've vexed you," said Lionel. "Come, let's kiss and
be friends." So he kissed the Prime Minister, and they settled down for
a nice quiet game of noughts and crosses while the Chancellor went to
add up his accounts.

But when Lionel was in bed he could not sleep for thinking of the book,
and when the full moon was shining with all her might and light he got
up and crept down to the library and climbed up and got _The Book of
Beasts_.

He took it outside to the terrace, where the moonlight was as bright as
day, and he opened the book, and saw the empty pages with "Butterfly"
and "Blue Bird of Paradise" underneath, and then he turned the next
page. There was some sort of red thing sitting under a palm tree, and
under it was written "Dragon." The Dragon did not move, and the King
shut up the book rather quickly and went back to bed.

But the next day he wanted another look, so he took the book out into
the garden, and when he undid the clasps with the rubies and turquoises,
the book opened all by itself at the picture with "Dragon" underneath,
and the sun shone full on the page. And then, quite suddenly, a great
Red Dragon came out of the book and spread vast scarlet wings and flew
away across the garden to the far hills, and Lionel was left with the
empty page before him, for the page was quite empty except for the green
palm tree and the yellow desert, and the little streaks of red where the
paintbrush had gone outside the pencil outline of the Red Dragon.

And then Lionel felt that he had indeed done it. He had not been King
twenty-four hours, and already he had let loose a Red Dragon to worry
his faithful subjects' lives out. And they had been saving up so long to
buy him a crown, and everything!

Lionel began to cry.

[Illustration: "The dragon flew away across the garden." _See page 8._]

The Chancellor and the Prime Minister and the Nurse all came running
to see what was the matter. And when they saw the book they understood,
and the Chancellor said: "You naughty little King! Put him to bed,
Nurse, and let him think over what he's done."

"Perhaps, my Lord," said the Prime Minister, "we'd better first find out
just exactly what he has done."

Then Lionel, in floods of tears, said: "It's a Red Dragon, and it's gone
flying away to the hills, and I am so sorry, and, oh, do forgive me!"

But the Prime Minister and the Chancellor had other things to think of
than forgiving Lionel. They hurried off to consult the police and see
what could be done. Everyone did what they could. They sat on committees
and stood on guard, and lay in wait for the Dragon, but he stayed up in
the hills, and there was nothing more to be done. The faithful Nurse,
meanwhile, did not neglect her duty. Perhaps she did more than anyone
else, for she slapped the King and put him to bed without his tea, and
when it got dark she would not give him a candle to read by.

"You are a naughty little King," she said, "and nobody will love you."

Next day the Dragon was still quiet, though the more poetic of Lionel's
subjects could see the redness of the Dragon shining through the green
trees quite plainly. So Lionel put on his crown and sat on his throne
and said he wanted to make some laws.

And I need hardly say that though the Prime Minister and the Chancellor
and the Nurse might have the very poorest opinion of Lionel's private
judgement, and might even slap him and send him to bed, the minute he
got on his throne and set his crown on his head, he became
infallible--which means that everything he said was right, and that he
couldn't possibly make a mistake. So when he said: "There is to be a law
forbidding people to open books in schools or elsewhere"--he had the
support of at least half of his subjects, and the other half--the
grown-up half--pretended to think he was quite right.

Then he made a law that everyone should always have enough to eat. And
this pleased everyone except the ones who had always had too much.

And when several other nice new laws were made and written down he went
home and made mud-houses and was very happy. And he said to his Nurse:
"People will love me now I've made such a lot of pretty new laws for
them."

But Nurse said: "Don't count your chickens, my dear. You haven't seen
the last of that Dragon yet."

Now, the next day was Saturday. And in the afternoon the Dragon suddenly
swooped down upon the common in all his hideous redness, and carried off
the Soccer Players, umpires, goal-posts, ball, and all.

Then the people were very angry indeed, and they said: "We might as well
be a Republic. After saving up all these years to get his crown, and
everything!"

And wise people shook their heads and foretold a decline in the National
Love of Sport. And, indeed, soccer was not at all popular for some time
afterward.

Lionel did his best to be a good King during the week, and the people
were beginning to forgive him for letting the Dragon out of the book.
"After all," they said, "soccer is a dangerous game, and perhaps it is
wise to discourage it."

Popular opinion held that the Soccer Players, being tough and hard, had
disagreed with the Dragon so much that he had gone away to some place
where they only play cats' cradle and games that do not make you hard
and tough.

All the same, Parliament met on the Saturday afternoon, a convenient
time, for most of the Members would be free to attend, to consider the
Dragon. But unfortunately the Dragon, who had only been asleep, woke up
because it was Saturday, and he considered the Parliament, and
afterwards there were not any Members left, so they tried to make a new
Parliament, but being a member of Parliament had somehow grown as
unpopular as soccer playing, and no one would consent to be elected, so
they had to do without a Parliament. When the next Saturday came around
everyone was a little nervous, but the Red Dragon was pretty quiet that
day and only ate an Orphanage.

Lionel was very, very unhappy. He felt that it was his disobedience that
had brought this trouble on the Parliament and the Orphanage and the
Soccer Players, and he felt that it was his duty to try and do
something. The question was, what?

The Blue Bird that had come out of the book used to sing very nicely in
the Palace rose garden, and the Butterfly was very tame, and would perch
on his shoulder when he walked among the tall lilies: so Lionel saw that
all the creatures in _The Book of Beasts_ could not be wicked, like the
Dragon, and he thought: "Suppose I could get another beast out who would
fight the Dragon?"

So he took _The Book of Beasts_ out into the rose garden and opened the
page next to the one where the Dragon had been just a tiny bit to see
what the name was. He could only see "cora," but he felt the middle of
the page swelling up thick with the creature that was trying to come
out, and it was only by putting the book down and sitting on it
suddenly, very hard, that he managed to get it shut. Then he fastened
the clasps with the rubies and turquoises in them and sent for the
Chancellor, who had been ill since Saturday, and so had not been eaten
with the rest of the Parliament, and he said: "What animal ends in
'cora'?"

The Chancellor answered: "The Manticora, of course."

"What is he like?" asked the King.

"He is the sworn foe of Dragons," said the Chancellor. "He drinks their
blood. He is yellow, with the body of a lion and the face of a man. I
wish we had a few Manticoras here now. But the last died hundreds of
years ago--worse luck!"

Then the King ran and opened the book at the page that had "cora" on it,
and there was the picture--Manticora, all yellow, with a lion's body and
a man's face, just as the Chancellor had said. And under the picture
was written, "Manticora."

In a few minutes the Manticora came sleepily out of the book, rubbing
its eyes with its hands and mewing piteously. It seemed very stupid, and
when Lionel gave it a push and said, "Go along and fight the Dragon,
do," it put its tail between its legs and fairly ran away. It went and
hid behind the Town Hall, and at night when the people were asleep it
went around and ate all the pussy-cats in the town. And then it mewed
more than ever. And on the Saturday morning, when people were a little
timid about going out, because the Dragon had no regular hour for
calling, the Manticora went up and down the streets and drank all the
milk that was left in the cans at the doors for people's teas, and it
ate the cans as well.

And just when it had finished the very last little halfpenny worth,
which was short measure, because the milkman's nerves were quite upset,
the Red Dragon came down the street looking for the Manticora. It edged
off when it saw him coming, for it was not at all the Dragon-fighting
kind; and, seeing no other door open, the poor, hunted creature took
refuge in the General Post Office, and there the Dragon found it, trying
to conceal itself among the ten o'clock mail. The Dragon fell on the
Manticora at once, and the mail was no defense. The mewings were heard
all over the town. All the kitties and the milk the Manticora had had
seemed to have strengthened its mew wonderfully. Then there was a sad
silence, and presently the people whose windows looked that way saw the
Dragon come walking down the steps of the General Post Office spitting
fire and smoke, together with tufts of Manticora fur, and the fragments
of the registered letters. Things were growing very serious. However
popular the King might become during the week, the Dragon was sure to do
something on Saturday to upset the people's loyalty.

[Illustration "The Manticora took refuge in the General Post Office."
_See page 13._]

The Dragon was a perfect nuisance for the whole of Saturday, except
during the hour of noon, and then he had to rest under a tree or he
would have caught fire from the heat of the sun. You see, he was very
hot to begin with.

At last came a Saturday when the Dragon actually walked into the Royal
nursery and carried off the King's own pet Rocking Horse. Then the King
cried for six days, and on the seventh he was so tired that he had to
stop. He heard the Blue Bird singing among the roses and saw the
Butterfly fluttering among the lilies, and he said: "Nurse, wipe my
face, please. I am not going to cry any more."

Nurse washed his face, and told him not to be a silly little King.
"Crying," said she, "never did anyone any good yet."

"I don't know," said the little King, "I seem to see better, and to hear
better now that I've cried for a week. Now, Nurse, dear, I know I'm
right, so kiss me in case I never come back. I _must_ try to see if I
can't save the people."

"Well, if you must, you must," said Nurse, "but don't tear your clothes
or get your feet wet."

So off he went.

The Blue Bird sang more sweetly than ever, and the Butterfly shone more
brightly, as Lionel once more carried _The Book of Beasts_ out into the
rose garden, and opened it--very quickly, so that he might not be afraid
and change his mind. The book fell open wide, almost in the middle, and
there was written at the bottom of the page, "Hippogriff," and before
Lionel had time to see what the picture was, there was a fluttering of
great wings and a stamping of hoofs, and a sweet, soft, friendly
neighing; and there came out of the book a beautiful white horse with a
long, long, white mane and a long, long, white tail, and he had great
wings like swan's wings, and the softest, kindest eyes in the world, and
he stood there among the roses.

The Hippogriff rubbed its silky-soft, milky white nose against the
little King's shoulder, and the little King thought: "But for the wings
you are very like my poor, dear lost Rocking Horse." And the Blue Bird's
song was very loud and sweet.

Then suddenly the King saw coming through the sky the great straggling,
sprawling, wicked shape of the Red Dragon. And he knew at once what he
must do. He caught up _The Book of Beasts_ and jumped on the back of the
gentle, beautiful Hippogriff, and leaning down he whispered in the
sharp, white ear: "Fly, dear Hippogriff, fly your very fastest to the
Pebbly Waste."

And when the Dragon saw them start, he turned and flew after them, with
his great wings flapping like clouds at sunset, and the Hippogriff's
wide wings were snowy as clouds at moonrise.

When the people in the town saw the Dragon fly off after the Hippogriff
and the King they all came out of their houses to look, and when they
saw the two disappear they made up their minds to the worst, and began
to think what they would wear for Court mourning.

But the Dragon could not catch the Hippogriff. The red wings were bigger
than the white ones, but they were not so strong, and so the
white-winged horse flew away and away and away, with the Dragon
pursuing, till he reached the very middle of the Pebbly Waste.

Now, the Pebbly Waste is just like the parts of the seaside where there
is no sand--all round, loose, shifting stones, and there is no grass
there and no tree within a hundred miles of it.

Lionel jumped off the white horse's back in the very middle of the
Pebbly Waste, and he hurriedly unclasped _The Book of Beasts_ and laid
it open on the pebbles. Then he clattered among the pebbles in his haste
to get back on to his white horse, and had just jumped on when up came
the Dragon. He was flying very feebly, and looking around everywhere for
a tree, for it was just on the stroke of twelve, the sun was shining
like a gold guinea in the blue sky, and there was not a tree for a
hundred miles.

The white-winged horse flew around and around the Dragon as he writhed
on the dry pebbles. He was getting very hot: indeed, parts of him even
had begun to smoke. He knew that he must certainly catch fire in
another minute unless he could get under a tree. He made a snatch with
his red claws at the King and Hippogriff, but he was too feeble to reach
them, and besides, he did not dare to overexert himself for fear he
should get any hotter.

It was then that he saw _The Book of Beasts_ lying on the pebbles, open
at the page with "Dragon" written at the bottom. He looked and he
hesitated, and he looked again, and then, with one last squirm of rage,
the Dragon wriggled himself back into the picture and sat down under the
palm tree, and the page was a little singed as he went in.

As soon as Lionel saw that the Dragon had really been obliged to go and
sit under his own palm tree because it was the only tree there, he
jumped off his horse and shut the book with a bang.

"Oh, hurrah!" he cried. "Now we really have done it."

And he clasped the book very tightly with the turquoise and ruby clasps.

"Oh, my precious Hippogriff," he cried. "You are the bravest, dearest,
most beautiful--"

"Hush," whispered the Hippogriff modestly. "Don't you see that we are
not alone?"

And indeed there was quite a crowd round them on the Pebbly Waste: the
Prime Minister and the Parliament and the Soccer Players and the
Orphanage and the Manticora and the Rocking Horse, and indeed everyone
who had been eaten by the Dragon. You see, it was impossible for the
Dragon to take them into the book with him--it was a tight fit even for
one Dragon--so, of course, he had to leave them outside.

       *       *       *       *       *

They all got home somehow, and all lived happy ever after.

When the King asked the Manticora where he would like to live he begged
to be allowed to go back into the book. "I do not care for public life,"
he said.

Of course he knew his way onto his own page, so there was no danger of
his opening the book at the wrong page and letting out a Dragon or
anything. So he got back into his picture and has never come out since:
That is why you will never see a Manticora as long as you live, except
in a picture-book. And of course he left the kitties outside, because
there was no room for them in the book--and the milk cans too.

Then the Rocking Horse begged to be allowed to go and live on the
Hippogriff's page of the book. "I should like," he said, "to live
somewhere where Dragons can't get at me."

So the beautiful, white-winged Hippogriff showed him the way in, and
there he stayed till the King had him taken out for his
great-great-great-great-grandchildren to play with.

As for the Hippogriff, he accepted the position of the King's Own
Rocking Horse--a situation left vacant by the retirement of the wooden
one. And the Blue Bird and the Butterfly sing and flutter among the
lilies and roses of the Palace garden to this very day.

[Illustration: UNCLE JAMES OR THE PURPLE STRANGER]




II. Uncle James, or The Purple Stranger


The Princess and the gardener's boy were playing in the backyard.

"What will you do when you grow up, Princess?" asked the gardener's boy.

"I should like to marry you, Tom," said the Princess. "Would you mind?"

"No," said the gardener's boy. "I shouldn't mind much. I'll marry you if
you like--if I have time."

For the gardener's boy meant, as soon as he was grown up, to be a
general and a poet and a Prime Minister and an admiral and a civil
engineer. Meanwhile, he was top of all his classes at school, and
tip-top of the geography class.

As for the Princess Mary Ann, she was a very good little girl, and
everyone loved her. She was always kind and polite, even to her Uncle
James and to other people whom she did not like very much; and though
she was not very clever, for a Princess, she always tried to do her
lessons. Even if you know perfectly well that you can't do your lessons,
you may as well try, and sometimes you find that by some fortunate
accident they really _are_ done. Then the Princess had a truly good
heart: She was always kind to her pets. She never slapped her
hippopotamus when it broke her dolls in its playful gambols, and she
never forgot to feed her rhinoceroses in their little hutch in the
backyard. Her elephant was devoted to her, and sometimes Mary Ann made
her nurse quite cross by smuggling the dear little thing up to bed with
her and letting it go to sleep with its long trunk laid lovingly across
her throat, and its pretty head cuddled under the Royal right ear.

When the Princess had been good all through the week--for, like all
real, live, nice children, she was sometimes naughty, but never
bad--Nurse would allow her to ask her little friends to come on
Wednesday morning early and spend the day, because Wednesday is the end
of the week in that country. Then, in the afternoon, when all the little
dukes and duchesses and marquises and countesses had finished their rice
pudding and had had their hands and faces washed after it, Nurse would
say: "Now, my dears, what would you like to do this afternoon?" just as
if she didn't know. And the answer would be always the same:

"Oh, do let's go to the Zoological Gardens and ride on the big guinea
pig and feed the rabbits and hear the dormouse asleep."

So their pinafores were taken off and they all went to the Zoological
Gardens, where twenty of them could ride at a time on the guinea pig,
and where even the little ones could feed the great rabbits if some
grown-up person were kind enough to lift them up for the purpose.

There always was some such person, because in Rotundia everybody was
kind--except one.

Now that you have read as far as this you know, of course, that the
Kingdom of Rotundia was a very remarkable place; and if you are a
thoughtful child--as of course you are--you will not need me to tell you
what was the most remarkable thing about it. But in case you are not a
thoughtful child--and it is just possible of course that you are not--I
will tell you at once what that most remarkable thing was. _All the
animals were the wrong sizes!_ And this was how it happened.

In old, old, olden times, when all our world was just loose earth and
air and fire and water mixed up anyhow like a pudding, and spinning
around like mad trying to get the different things to settle into their
proper places, a round piece of earth got loose and went spinning away
by itself across the water, which was just beginning to try to get
spread out smooth into a real sea. And as the great round piece of earth
flew away, going around and around as hard as it could, it met a long
piece of hard rock that had got loose from another part of the puddingy
mixture, and the rock was so hard, and was going so fast, that it ran
its point through the round piece of earth and stuck out on the other
side of it, so that the two together were like a very-very-much-too-big
spinning top.

I am afraid all this is very dull, but you know geography is never quite
lively, and after all, I must give you a little information even in a
fairy tale--like the powder in jam.

Well, when the pointed rock smashed into the round bit of earth the
shock was so great that it set them spinning together through the
air--which was just getting into its proper place, like all the rest of
the things--only, as luck would have it, they forgot which way around
they had been going, and began to spin around the wrong way. Presently
Center of Gravity--a great giant who was managing the whole
business--woke up in the middle of the earth and began to grumble.

"Hurry up," he said. "Come down and lie still, can't you?"

So the rock with the round piece of earth fell into the sea, and the
point of the rock went into a hole that just fitted it in the stony sea
bottom, and there it spun around the wrong way seven times and then lay
still. And that round piece of land became, after millions of years, the
Kingdom of Rotundia.

This is the end of the geography lesson. And now for just a little
natural history, so that we may not feel that we are quite wasting our
time. Of course, the consequence of the island having spun around the
wrong way was that when the animals began to grow on the island they all
grew the wrong sizes. The guinea pig, as you know, was as big as our
elephants, and the elephant--dear little pet--was the size of the silly,
tiny, black-and-tan dogs that ladies carry sometimes in their muffs. The
rabbits were about the size of our rhinoceroses, and all about the wild
parts of the island they had made their burrows as big as railway
tunnels. The dormouse, of course, was the biggest of all the creatures.
I can't tell you how big he was. Even if you think of elephants it will
not help you at all. Luckily there was only one of him, and he was
always asleep. Otherwise I don't think the Rotundians could have borne
with him. As it was, they made him a house, and it saved the expense of
a brass band, because no band could possibly have been heard when the
dormouse was talking in his sleep.

The men and women and children in this wonderful island were quite the
right size, because their ancestors had come over with the Conqueror
long after the island had settled down and the animals grown on it.

Now the natural history lesson is over, and if you have been attending,
you know more about Rotundia than anyone there did, except three people:
the Lord Chief Schoolmaster, the Princess's uncle--who was a magician,
and knew everything without learning it--and Tom, the gardener's son.

Tom had learned more at school than anyone else, because he wished to
take a prize. The prize offered by the Lord Chief Schoolmaster was a
_History of Rotundia_, beautifully bound, with the Royal arms on the
back. But after that day when the Princess said she meant to marry Tom,
the gardener's boy thought it over, and he decided that the best prize
in the world would be the Princess, and this was the prize Tom meant to
take; and when you are a gardener's son and have decided to marry a
Princess, you will find that the more you learn at school the better.

The Princess always played with Tom on the days when the little dukes
and marquises did not come to tea--and when he told her he was almost
sure of the first prize, she clapped her hands and said: "Dear Tom, dear
good, clever Tom, you deserve all the prizes. And I will give you my pet
elephant--and you can keep him till we're married."

The pet elephant was called Fido, and the gardener's son took him away
in his coat pocket. He was the dearest little elephant you ever
saw--about six inches long. But he was very, very wise--he could not
have been wiser if he had been a mile high. He lay down comfortably in
Tom's pocket, and when Tom put in his hand, Fido curled his little trunk
around Tom's fingers with an affectionate confidence that made the boy's
heart warm to his new little pet. What with the elephant, and the
Princess's affection, and the knowledge that the very next day he would
receive the _History of Rotundia_, beautifully bound, with the Royal
arms on the cover, Tom could hardly sleep a wink. And, besides, the dog
did bark so terribly. There was only one dog in Rotundia--the kingdom
could not afford to keep more than one: He was a Mexican lapdog of the
kind that in most parts of the world only measures seven inches from the
end of his dear nose to the tip of his darling tail--but in Rotundia he
was bigger than I can possibly expect you to believe. And when he
barked, his bark was so large that it filled up all the night and left
no room for sleep or dreams or polite conversation, or anything else at
all. He never barked at things that went on in the island--he was too
large-minded for that; but when ships went blundering by in the dark,
tumbling over the rocks at the end of the island, he would bark once or
twice, just to let the ships know that they couldn't come playing about
there just as they liked.

But on this particular night he barked and barked and barked--and the
Princess said, "Oh dear, oh dear, I wish he wouldn't, I am so sleepy."
And Tom said to himself, "I wonder whatever is the matter. As soon as
it's light I'll go and see."

So when it began to be pretty pink-and-yellow daylight, Tom got up and
went out. And all the time the Mexican lapdog barked so that the houses
shook, and the tiles on the roof of the palace rattled like milk cans in
a cart whose horse is frisky.

"I'll go to the pillar," thought Tom, as he went through the town. The
pillar, of course, was the top of the piece of rock that had stuck
itself through Rotundia millions of years before, and made it spin
around the wrong way. It was quite in the middle of the island, and
stuck up ever so far, and when you were at the top you could see a great
deal farther than when you were not.

As Tom went out from the town and across the downs, he thought what a
pretty sight it was to see the rabbits in the bright, dewy morning,
frisking with their young ones by the mouths of their burrows. He did
not go very near the rabbits, of course, because when a rabbit of that
size is at play it does not always look where it is going, and it might
easily have crushed Tom with its foot, and then it would have been very
sorry afterward. And Tom was a kind boy, and would not have liked to
make even a rabbit unhappy. Earwigs in our country often get out of the
way when they think you are going to walk on them. They too have kind
hearts, and they would not like you to be sorry afterward.

So Tom went on, looking at the rabbits and watching the morning grow
more and more red and golden. And the Mexican lapdog barked all the
time, till the church bells tinkled, and the chimney of the apple
factory rocked again.

But when Tom got to the pillar, he saw that he would not need to climb
to the top to find out what the dog was barking at.

For there, by the pillar, lay a very large purple dragon. His wings were
like old purple umbrellas that have been very much rained on, and his
head was large and bald, like the top of a purple toadstool, and his
tail, which was purple too, was very, very, very long and thin and
tight, like the lash of a carriage whip.

It was licking one of its purple umbrella-y wings, and every now and
then it moaned and leaned its head back against the rocky pillar as
though it felt faint. Tom saw at once what had happened. A flight of
purple dragons must have crossed the island in the night, and this poor
one must have knocked its wing and broken it against the pillar.

Everyone is kind to everyone in Rotundia, and Tom was not afraid of the
dragon, although he had never spoken to one before. He had often watched
them flying across the sea, but he had never expected to get to know one
personally.

So now he said: "I am afraid you don't feel quite well."

The dragon shook his large purple head. He could not speak, but like all
other animals, he could understand well enough when he liked.

"Can I get you anything?" asked Tom, politely.

The dragon opened his purple eyes with an inquiring smile.

"A bun or two, now," said Tom, coaxingly. "There's a beautiful bun tree
quite close."

The dragon opened a great purple mouth and licked his purple lips, so
Tom ran and shook the bun tree, and soon came back with an armful of
fresh currant buns, and as he came he picked a few of the Bath kind,
which grow on the low bushes near the pillar.

Because, of course, another consequence of the island's having spun the
wrong way is that all the things we have to make--buns and cakes and
shortbread--grow on trees and bushes, but in Rotundia they have to make
their cauliflowers and cabbages and carrots and apples and onions, just
as our cooks make puddings and turnovers.

Tom gave all the buns to the dragon, saying: "Here, try to eat a little.
You'll soon feel better then."

The dragon ate up the buns, nodded rather ungraciously, and began to
lick his wing again. So Tom left him and went back to the town with the
news, and everyone was so excited at a real live dragon's being on the
island--a thing that had never happened before--that they all went out
to look at it, instead of going to the prize-giving, and the Lord Chief
Schoolmaster went with the rest. Now, he had Tom's prize, the _History
of Rotundia_, in his pocket--the one bound in calf, with the Royal arms
on the cover--and it happened to drop out, and the dragon ate it, so Tom
never got the prize after all. But the dragon, when he had gotten it,
did not like it.

"Perhaps it's all for the best," said Tom. "I might not have liked that
prize either, if I had gotten it."

It happened to be a Wednesday, so when the Princess's friends were asked
what they would like to do, all the little dukes and marquises and earls
said, "Let's go and see the dragon." But the little duchesses and
marchionesses and countesses said they were afraid.

Then Princess Mary Ann spoke up royally, and said, "Don't be silly,
because it's only in fairy stories and histories of England and things
like that, that people are unkind and want to hurt each other. In
Rotundia everyone is kind, and no one has anything to be afraid of,
unless they're naughty; and then we know it's for our own good. Let's
all go and see the dragon. We might take him some acid drops." So they
went. And all the titled children took it in turns to feed the dragon
with acid drops, and he seemed pleased and flattered, and wagged as much
of his purple tail as he could get at conveniently; for it was a very,
very long tail indeed. But when it came to the Princess's turn to give
an acid drop to the dragon, he smiled a very wide smile, and wagged his
tail to the very last long inch of it, as much as to say, "Oh, you nice,
kind, pretty little Princess." But deep down in his wicked purple heart
he was saying, "Oh, you nice, fat, pretty little Princess, I should like
to eat you instead of these silly acid drops." But of course nobody
heard him except the Princess's uncle, and he was a magician, and
accustomed to listening at doors. It was part of his trade.

Now, you will remember that I told you there was one wicked person in
Rotundia, and I cannot conceal from you any longer that this Complete
Bad was the Princess's Uncle James. Magicians are always bad, as you
know from your fairy books, and some uncles are bad, as you see by the
_Babes in the Wood_, or the _Norfolk Tragedy_, and one James at least
was bad, as you have learned from your English history. And when anyone
is a magician, and is also an uncle, and is named James as well, you
need not expect anything nice from him. He is a Threefold Complete
Bad--and he will come to no good.

Uncle James had long wanted to get rid of the Princess and have the
kingdom to himself. He did not like many things--a nice kingdom was
almost the only thing he cared for--but he had never seen his way quite
clearly, because everyone is so kind in Rotundia that wicked spells will
not work there, but run off those blameless islanders like water off a
duck's back. Now, however, Uncle James thought there might be a chance
for him--because he knew that now there were two wicked people on the
island who could stand by each other--himself and the dragon. He said
nothing, but he exchanged a meaningful glance with the dragon, and
everyone went home to tea. And no one had seen the meaningful glance
except Tom.

Tom went home, and told his elephant all about it. The intelligent
little creature listened carefully, and then climbed from Tom's knee to
the table, on which stood an ornamental calendar that the Princess had
given Tom for a Christmas present. With its tiny trunk the elephant
pointed out a date--the fifteenth of August, the Princess's birthday,
and looked anxiously at its master.

"What is it, Fido--good little elephant--then?" said Tom, and the
sagacious animal repeated its former gesture. Then Tom understood.

"Oh, something is to happen on her birthday? All right. I'll be on the
lookout." And he was.

[Illustration: "By-and-by he began to wander." _See page 29._]

At first the people of Rotundia were quite pleased with the dragon, who
lived by the pillar and fed himself from the bun trees, but by-and-by he
began to wander. He would creep into the burrows made by the great
rabbits; and excursionists, sporting on the downs, would see his long,
tight, whiplike tail wriggling down a burrow and out of sight, and
before they had time to say, "There he goes," his ugly purple head
would come poking out from another rabbit-hole--perhaps just behind
them--or laugh softly to itself just in their ears. And the dragon's
laugh was not a merry one. This sort of hide-and-seek amused people at
first, but by-and-by it began to get on their nerves: and if you don't
know what that means, ask Mother to tell you next time you are playing
blind man's buff when she has a headache. Then the dragon got into the
habit of cracking his tail, as people crack whips, and this also got on
people's nerves. Then, too, little things began to be missed. And you
know how unpleasant that is, even in a private school, and in a public
kingdom it is, of course, much worse. The things that were missed were
nothing much at first--a few little elephants, a hippopotamus or two,
and some giraffes, and things like that. It was nothing much, as I say,
but it made people feel uncomfortable. Then one day a favorite rabbit of
the Princess's, called Frederick, mysteriously disappeared, and then
came a terrible morning when the Mexican lapdog was missing. He had
barked ever since the dragon came to the island, and people had grown
quite used to the noise. So when his barking suddenly ceased it woke
everybody up--and they all went out to see what was the matter. And the
lapdog was gone!

A boy was sent to wake the army, so that it might look for him. But the
army was gone too! And now the people began to be frightened. Then Uncle
James came out onto the terrace of the palace, and he made the people a
speech. He said: "Friends--fellow citizens--I cannot disguise from
myself or from you that this purple dragon is a poor penniless exile, a
helpless alien in our midst, and, besides, he is a--is no end of a
dragon."

The people thought of the dragon's tail and said, "Hear, hear."

Uncle James went on: "Something has happened to a gentle and defenseless
member of our community. We don't know what has happened."

Everyone thought of the rabbit named Frederick, and groaned.

"The defenses of our country have been swallowed up," said Uncle James.

Everyone thought of the poor army.

"There is only one thing to be done." Uncle James was warming to his
subject. "Could we ever forgive ourselves if by neglecting a simple
precaution we lost more rabbits--or even, perhaps, our navy, our police,
and our fire brigade? For I warn you that the purple dragon will respect
nothing, however sacred."

Everyone thought of themselves--and they said, "What is the simple
precaution?"

Then Uncle James said: "Tomorrow is the dragon's birthday. He is
accustomed to have a present on his birthday. If he gets a nice present
he will be in a hurry to take it away and show it to his friends, and he
will fly off and never come back."

The crowd cheered wildly--and the Princess from her balcony clapped her
hands.

"The present the dragon expects," said Uncle James, cheerfully, "is
rather an expensive one. But, when we give, it should not be in a
grudging spirit, especially to visitors. What the dragon wants is a
Princess. We have only one Princess, it is true; but far be it from us
to display a miserly temper at such a moment. And the gift is worthless
that costs the giver nothing. Your readiness to give up your Princess
will only show how generous you are."

The crowd began to cry, for they loved their Princess, though they quite
saw that their first duty was to be generous and give the poor dragon
what it wanted.

The Princess began to cry, for she did not want to be anybody's birthday
present--especially a purple dragon's. And Tom began to cry because he
was so angry.

He went straight home and told his little elephant; and the elephant
cheered him up so much that presently the two grew quite absorbed in a
top that the elephant was spinning with his little trunk.

Early in the morning Tom went to the palace. He looked out across the
downs--there were hardly any rabbits playing there now--and then he
gathered white roses and threw them at the Princess's window till she
woke up and looked out.

"Come up and kiss me," she said.

So Tom climbed up the white rosebush and kissed the Princess through the
window, and said: "Many happy returns of the day."

Then Mary Ann began to cry, and said: "Oh, Tom--how can you? When you
know quite well--"

"Oh, don't," said Tom. "Why, Mary Ann, my precious, my Princess--what do
you think I should be doing while the dragon was getting his birthday
present? Don't cry, my own little Mary Ann! Fido and I have arranged
everything. You've only got to do as you are told."

"Is that all?" said the Princess. "Oh--that's easy--I've often done
that!"

Then Tom told her what she was to do. And she kissed him again and
again. "Oh, you dear, good, clever Tom," she said. "How glad I am that I
gave you Fido. You two have saved me. You dears!"

The next morning Uncle James put on his best coat and hat and the vest
with the gold snakes on it--he was a magician, and he had a bright taste
in vests--and he called with a cab to take the Princess out.

"Come, little birthday present," he said tenderly. "The dragon will be
so pleased. And I'm glad to see you're not crying. You know, my child,
we cannot begin too young to learn to think of the happiness of others
rather than our own. I should not like my dear little niece to be
selfish, or to wish to deny a trivial pleasure to a poor, sick dragon,
far from his home and friends."

The Princess said she would try not to be selfish.

Presently the cab drew up near the pillar, and there was the dragon, his
ugly purple head shining in the sun, and his ugly purple mouth half
open.

Uncle James said: "Good morning, sir. We have brought you a small
present for your birthday. We do not like to let such an anniversary go
by without some suitable testimonial, especially to one who is a
stranger in our midst. Our means are small, but our hearts are large. We
have but one Princess, but we give her freely--do we not, my child?"

The Princess said she supposed so, and the dragon came a little nearer.

Suddenly a voice cried: "Run!" and there was Tom, and he had brought the
Zoological guinea pig and a pair of Belgian hares with him. "Just to see
fair," said Tom.

Uncle James was furious. "What do you mean, sir," he cried, "by
intruding on a State function with your common rabbits and things? Go
away, naughty little boy, and play with them somewhere else."

But while he was speaking the rabbits had come up one on each side of
him, their great sides towering ever so high, and now they pressed him
between them so that he was buried in their thick fur and almost choked.
The Princess, meantime, had run to the other side of the pillar and was
peeping around it to see what was going on. A crowd had followed the cab
out of the town; now they reached the scene of the "State Function"--and
they all cried out: "Fair play--play fair! We can't go back on our word
like this. Give a thing and take a thing? Why, it's never done. Let the
poor exiled stranger dragon have his birthday present." And they tried
to get at Tom--but the guinea pig stood in the way.

"Yes," Tom cried. "Fair play is a jewel. And your helpless exile shall
have the Princess--if he can catch her. Now then, Mary Ann."

Mary Ann looked around the big pillar and called to the dragon: "Bo! you
can't catch me," and began to run as fast as ever she could, and the
dragon ran after her. When the Princess had run a half mile she stopped,
dodged around a tree, and ran back to the pillar and around it, and the
dragon after her. You see, he was so long he could not turn as quickly
as she could. Around and around the pillar ran the Princess. The first
time she ran around a long way from the pillar, and then nearer and
nearer--with the dragon after her all the time; and he was so busy
trying to catch her that he never noticed that Tom had tied the very end
of his long, tight, whipcordy tail to the rock, so that the more the
dragon ran around, the more times he twisted his tail around the pillar.
It was exactly like winding a top--only the peg was the pillar, and the
dragon's tail was the string. And the magician was safe between the
Belgian hares, and couldn't see anything but darkness, or do anything
but choke.

When the dragon was wound onto the pillar as much as he possibly could
be, and as tight--like cotton on a reel--the Princess stopped running,
and though she had very little breath left, she managed to say,
"Yah--who's won now?"

This annoyed the dragon so much that he put out all his strength--spread
his great purple wings, and tried to fly at her. Of course this pulled
his tail, and pulled it very hard, so hard that as he pulled the tail
_had_ to come, and the pillar _had_ to come around with the tail, and
the island _had_ to come around with the pillar, and in another minute
the tail was loose, and the island was spinning around exactly like a
top. It spun so fast that everyone fell flat on their faces and held on
tight to themselves, because they felt something was going to happen.
All but the magician, who was choking between the Belgian hares, and
felt nothing but fur and fury.

And something did happen. The dragon had sent the kingdom of Rotundia
spinning the way it ought to have gone at the beginning of the world,
and as it spun around, all the animals began to change sizes. The guinea
pigs got small, and the elephants got big, and the men and women and
children would have changed sizes too, if they had not had the sense to
hold on to themselves, very tight indeed, with both hands; which, of
course, the animals could not be expected to know how to do. And the
best of it was that when the small beasts got big and the big beasts got
small the dragon got small too, and fell at the Princess's feet--a
little, crawling, purple newt with wings.

[Illustration: "The dragon ran after her." _See page 34._]

"Funny little thing," said the Princess, when she saw it. "I will take
it for a birthday present."

But while all the people were still on their faces, holding on tight to
themselves, Uncle James, the magician, never thought of holding
tight--he only thought of how to punish Belgian hares and the sons of
gardeners; so when the big beasts grew small, he grew small with the
other beasts, and the little purple dragon, when he fell at the
Princess's feet, saw there a very small magician named Uncle James. And
the dragon took him because it wanted a birthday present.

So now all the animals were new sizes--and at first it seemed very
strange to everyone to have great lumbering elephants and a tiny little
dormouse, but they have gotten used to it now, and think no more of it
than we do.

All this happened several years ago, and the other day I saw in the
_Rotundia Times_ an account of the wedding of the Princess with Lord
Thomas Gardener, K.C.D., and I knew she could not have married anyone
but Tom, so I suppose they made him a Lord on purpose for the
wedding--and _K.C.D._, of course, means Clever Conqueror of the Dragon.
If you think that is wrong it is only because you don't know how they
spell in Rotundia. The paper said that among the beautiful presents of
the bridegroom to the bride was an enormous elephant, on which the
bridal pair made their wedding tour. This must have been Fido. You
remember Tom promised to give him back to the Princess when they were
married. The _Rotundia Times_ called the married couple "the happy
pair." It was clever of the paper to think of calling them that--it is
such a pretty and novel expression, and I think it is truer than many of
the things you see in papers.

Because, you see, the Princess and the gardener's son were so fond of
each other they could not help being happy--and besides, they had an
elephant of their very own to ride on. If that is not enough to make
people happy, I should like to know what is. Though, of course, I know
there are some people who could not be happy unless they had a whale to
sail on, and perhaps not even then. But they are greedy, grasping
people, the kind who would take four helps of pudding, as likely as not,
which neither Tom nor Mary Ann ever did.

[Illustration: THE DELIVERERS OF THEIR COUNTRY]




III. The Deliverers of Their Country


It all began with Effie's getting something in her eye. It hurt very
much indeed, and it felt something like a red-hot spark--only it seemed
to have legs as well, and wings like a fly. Effie rubbed and cried--not
real crying, but the kind your eye does all by itself without your being
miserable inside your mind--and then she went to her father to have the
thing in her eye taken out. Effie's father was a doctor, so of course he
knew how to take things out of eyes--he did it very cleverly with a soft
paintbrush dipped in castor oil.

When he had gotten the thing out, he said: "This is very curious." Effie
had often got things in her eye before, and her father had always seemed
to think it was natural--rather tiresome and naughty perhaps, but still
natural. He had never before thought it curious.

Effie stood holding her handkerchief to her eye, and said: "I don't
believe it's out." People always say this when they have had something
in their eyes.

"Oh, yes--it's out," said the doctor. "Here it is, on the brush. This is
very interesting."

Effie had never heard her father say that about anything that she had
any share in. She said: "What?"

The doctor carried the brush very carefully across the room, and held
the point of it under his microscope--then he twisted the brass screws
of the microscope, and looked through the top with one eye.

"Dear me," he said. "Dear, dear me! Four well-developed limbs; a long
caudal appendage; five toes, unequal in lengths, almost like one of the
_Lacertidae_, yet there are traces of wings." The creature under his eye
wriggled a little in the castor oil, and he went on: "Yes; a batlike
wing. A new specimen, undoubtedly. Effie, run round to the professor and
ask him to be kind enough to step in for a few minutes."

"You might give me sixpence, Daddy," said Effie, "because I did bring
you the new specimen. I took great care of it inside my eye, and my eye
_does_ hurt."

The doctor was so pleased with the new specimen that he gave Effie a
shilling, and presently the professor stepped round. He stayed to lunch,
and he and the doctor quarreled very happily all the afternoon about the
name and the family of the thing that had come out of Effie's eye.

But at teatime another thing happened. Effie's brother Harry fished
something out of his tea, which he thought at first was an earwig. He
was just getting ready to drop it on the floor, and end its life in the
usual way, when it shook itself in the spoon--spread two wet wings, and
flopped onto the tablecloth. There it sat, stroking itself with its feet
and stretching its wings, and Harry said: "Why, it's a tiny newt!"

The professor leaned forward before the doctor could say a word. "I'll
give you half a crown for it, Harry, my lad," he said, speaking very
fast; and then he picked it up carefully on his handkerchief.

"It is a new specimen," he said, "and finer than yours, Doctor."

It was a tiny lizard, about half an inch long--with scales and wings.

So now the doctor and the professor each had a specimen, and they were
both very pleased. But before long these specimens began to seem less
valuable. For the next morning, when the knife-boy was cleaning the
doctor's boots, he suddenly dropped the brushes and the boot and the
blacking, and screamed out that he was burnt.

And from inside the boot came crawling a lizard as big as a kitten, with
large, shiny wings.

"Why," said Effie, "I know what it is. It is a dragon like the one St.
George killed."

And Effie was right. That afternoon Towser was bitten in the garden by a
dragon about the size of a rabbit, which he had tried to chase, and the
next morning all the papers were full of the wonderful "winged lizards"
that were appearing all over the country. The papers would not call them
dragons, because, of course, no one believes in dragons nowadays--and at
any rate the papers were not going to be so silly as to believe in fairy
stories. At first there were only a few, but in a week or two the
country was simply running alive with dragons of all sizes, and in the
air you could sometimes see them as thick as a swarm of bees. They all
looked alike except as to size. They were green with scales, and they
had four legs and a long tail and great wings like bats' wings, only the
wings were a pale, half-transparent yellow, like the gear-boxes on
bicycles.

They breathed fire and smoke, as all proper dragons must, but still the
newspapers went on pretending they were lizards, until the editor of the
_Standard_ was picked up and carried away by a very large one, and then
the other newspaper people had not anyone left to tell them what they
ought not to believe. So when the largest elephant in the Zoo was
carried off by a dragon, the papers gave up pretending--and put ALARMING
PLAGUE OF DRAGONS at the top of the paper.

[Illustration: "The largest elephant in the zoo was carried off." _See
page 43._]

You have no idea how alarming it was, and at the same time how
aggravating. The large-size dragons were terrible certainly, but when
once you had found out that the dragons always went to bed early because
they were afraid of the chill night air, you had only to stay indoors
all day, and you were pretty safe from the big ones. But the smaller
sizes were a perfect nuisance. The ones as big as earwigs got in the
soap, and they got in the butter. The ones as big as dogs got in the
bath, and the fire and smoke inside them made them steam like anything
when the cold water tap was turned on, so that careless people were
often scalded quite severely. The ones that were as large as pigeons
would get into workbaskets or corner drawers and bite you when you were
in a hurry to get a needle or a handkerchief. The ones as big as sheep
were easier to avoid, because you could see them coming; but when they
flew in at the windows and curled up under your eiderdown, and you did
not find them till you went to bed, it was always a shock. The ones this
size did not eat people, only lettuce, but they always scorched the
sheets and pillowcases dreadfully.

Of course, the County Council and the police did everything that could
be done: It was no use offering the hand of the Princess to anyone who
killed a dragon. This way was all very well in olden times--when there
was only one dragon and one Princess; but now there were far more
dragons than Princesses--although the Royal Family was a large one. And
besides, it would have been a mere waste of Princesses to offer rewards
for killing dragons, because everybody killed as many dragons as they
could quite out of their own heads and without rewards at all, just to
get the nasty things out of the way. The County Council undertook to
cremate all dragons delivered at their offices between the hours of ten
and two, and whole wagonloads and cartloads and truckloads of dead
dragons could be seen any day of the week standing in a long line in the
street where the County Council had their offices. Boys brought
barrowloads of dead dragons, and children on their way home from morning
school would call in to leave the handful or two of little dragons they
had brought in their satchels, or carried in their knotted pocket
handkerchiefs. And yet there seemed to be as many dragons as ever. Then
the police stuck up great wood and canvas towers covered with patent
glue. When the dragons flew against these towers, they stuck fast, as
flies and wasps do on the sticky papers in the kitchen; and when the
towers were covered all over with dragons, the police inspector used to
set fire to the towers, and burnt them and dragons and all.

And yet there seemed to be more dragons than ever. The shops were full
of patent dragon poison and anti-dragon soap, and dragonproof curtains
for the windows; and indeed, everything that could be done was done.

And yet there seemed to be more dragons than ever.

It was not very easy to know what would poison a dragon, because, you
see, they ate such different things. The largest kind ate elephants as
long as there were any, and then went on with horses and cows. Another
size ate nothing but lilies of the valley, and a third size ate only
Prime Ministers if they were to be had, and, if not, would feed freely
on servants in livery. Another size lived on bricks, and three of them
ate two thirds of the South Lambeth Infirmary in one afternoon.

But the size Effie was most afraid of was about as big as your dining
room, and that size ate little girls and boys.

At first Effie and her brother were quite pleased with the change in
their lives. It was so amusing to sit up all night instead of going to
sleep, and to play in the garden lighted by electric lamps. And it
sounded so funny to hear Mother say, when they were going to bed: "Good
night, my darlings, sleep sound all day, and don't get up too soon. You
must not get up before it's quite dark. You wouldn't like the nasty
dragons to catch you."

But after a time they got very tired of it all: They wanted to see the
flowers and trees growing in the fields, and to see the pretty sunshine
out of doors, and not just through glass windows and patent dragonproof
curtains. And they wanted to play on the grass, which they were not
allowed to do in the electric lamp-lighted garden because of the
night-dew.

And they wanted so much to get out, just for once, in the beautiful,
bright, dangerous daylight, that they began to try and think of some
reason why they ought to go out. Only they did not like to disobey their
mother.

But one morning their mother was busy preparing some new dragon poison
to lay down in the cellars, and their father was bandaging the hand of
the boot boy, which had been scratched by one of the dragons who liked
to eat Prime Ministers when they were to be had, so nobody remembered to
say to the children: "Don't get up till it is quite dark!"

"Go now," said Harry. "It would not be disobedient to go. And I know
exactly what we ought to do, but I don't know how we ought to do it."

"What ought we to do?" said Effie.

"We ought to wake St. George, of course," said Harry. "He was the only
person in his town who knew how to manage dragons; the people in the
fairy tales don't count. But St. George is a real person, and he is only
asleep, and he is waiting to be waked up. Only nobody believes in St.
George now. I heard father say so."

"We do," said Effie.

"Of course we do. And don't you see, Ef, that's the very reason why we
could wake him? You can't wake people if you don't believe in them, can
you?"

Effie said no, but where could they find St. George?

"We must go and look," said Harry boldly. "You shall wear a dragonproof
frock, made of stuff like the curtains. And I will smear myself all over
with the best dragon poison, and--"

Effie clasped her hands and skipped with joy and cried: "Oh, Harry! I
know where we can find St. George! In St. George's Church, of course."

"Um," said Harry, wishing he had thought of it for himself, "you have a
little sense sometimes, for a girl."

So the next afternoon, quite early, long before the beams of sunset
announced the coming night, when everybody would be up and working, the
two children got out of bed. Effie wrapped herself in a shawl of
dragonproof muslin--there was no time to make the frock--and Harry made
a horrid mess of himself with the patent dragon poison. It was warranted
harmless to infants and invalids, so he felt quite safe.

Then they joined hands and set out to walk to St. George's Church. As
you know, there are many St. George's churches, but fortunately they
took the turning that leads to the right one, and went along in the
bright sunlight, feeling very brave and adventurous.

There was no one about in the streets except dragons, and the place was
simply swarming with them. Fortunately none of the dragons were just the
right size for eating little boys and girls, or perhaps this story might
have had to end here. There were dragons on the pavement, and dragons on
the roadway, dragons basking on the front doorsteps of public buildings,
and dragons preening their wings on the roofs in the hot afternoon sun.
The town was quite green with them. Even when the children had gotten
out of the town and were walking in the lanes, they noticed that the
fields on each side were greener than usual with the scaly legs and
tails; and some of the smaller sizes had made themselves asbestos nests
in the flowering hawthorn hedges.

Effie held her brother's hand very tight, and once when a fat dragon
flopped against her ear she screamed out, and a whole flight of green
dragons rose from the field at the sound, and sprawled away across the
sky. The children could hear the rattle of their wings as they flew.

"Oh, I want to go home," said Effie.

"Don't be silly," said Harry. "Surely you haven't forgotten about the
Seven Champions and all the princes. People who are going to be their
country's deliverers never scream and say they want to go home."

"And are we," asked Effie--"deliverers, I mean?"

"You'll see," said her brother, and on they went.

When they came to St. George's Church they found the door open, and they
walked right in--but St. George was not there, so they walked around the
churchyard outside, and presently they found the great stone tomb of St.
George, with the figure of him carved in marble outside, in his armor
and helmet, and with his hands folded on his breast.

"How ever can we wake him?" they said. Then Harry spoke to St.
George--but he would not answer; and he called, but St. George did not
seem to hear; and then he actually tried to waken the great
dragon-slayer by shaking his marble shoulders. But St. George took no
notice.

Then Effie began to cry, and she put her arms around St. George's neck
as well as she could for the marble, which was very much in the way at
the back, and she kissed the marble face, and she said: "Oh, dear, good,
kind St. George, please wake up and help us."

And at that St. George opened his eyes sleepily, and stretched himself
and said: "What's the matter, little girl?"

So the children told him all about it; he turned over in his marble and
leaned on one elbow to listen. But when he heard that there were so many
dragons he shook his head.

"It's no good," he said, "they would be one too many for poor old
George. You should have waked me before. I was always for a fair
fight--one man one dragon, was my motto."

Just then a flight of dragons passed overhead, and St. George half drew
his sword.

But he shook his head again and pushed the sword back as the flight of
dragons grew small in the distance.

"I can't do anything," he said. "Things have changed since my time. St.
Andrew told me about it. They woke him up over the engineers' strike,
and he came to talk to me. He says everything is done by machinery now;
there must be some way of settling these dragons. By the way, what sort
of weather have you been having lately?"

This seemed so careless and unkind that Harry would not answer, but
Effie said patiently, "It has been very fine. Father says it is the
hottest weather there has ever been in this country."

"Ah, I guessed as much," said the Champion, thoughtfully. "Well, the
only thing would be ... dragons can't stand wet and cold, that's the
only thing. If you could find the taps."

St. George was beginning to settle down again on his stone slab.

"Good night, very sorry I can't help you," he said, yawning behind his
marble hand.

"Oh, but you can," cried Effie. "Tell us--what taps?"

"Oh, like in the bathroom," said St. George, still more sleepily. "And
there's a looking glass, too; shows you all the world and what's going
on. St. Denis told me about it; said it was a very pretty thing. I'm
sorry I can't--good night."

And he fell back into his marble and was fast asleep again in a moment.

"We shall never find the taps," said Harry. "I say, wouldn't it be awful
if St. George woke up when there was a dragon near, the size that eats
champions?"

Effie pulled off her dragonproof veil. "We didn't meet any the size of
the dining room as we came along," she said. "I daresay we shall be
quite safe."

So she covered St. George with the veil, and Harry rubbed off as much as
he could of the dragon poison onto St. George's armor, so as to make
everything quite safe for him.

"We might hide in the church till it is dark," he said, "and then--"

But at that moment a dark shadow fell on them, and they saw that it was
a dragon exactly the size of the dining room at home.

So then they knew that all was lost. The dragon swooped down and caught
the two children in his claws; he caught Effie by her green silk sash,
and Harry by the little point at the back of his Eton jacket--and then,
spreading his great yellow wings, he rose into the air, rattling like a
third-class carriage when the brake is hard on.

"Oh, Harry," said Effie, "I wonder when he will eat us!" The dragon was
flying across woods and fields with great flaps of his wings that
carried him a quarter of a mile at each flap.

[Illustration: "He rose into the air, rattling like a third-class
carriage." _See page 50._]

Harry and Effie could see the country below, hedges and rivers and
churches and farmhouses flowing away from under them, much faster than
you see them running away from the sides of the fastest express train.

And still the dragon flew on. The children saw other dragons in the air
as they went, but the dragon who was as big as the dining room never
stopped to speak to any of them, but just flew on quite steadily.

"He knows where he wants to go," said Harry. "Oh, if he would only drop
us before he gets there!"

But the dragon held on tight, and he flew and flew and flew until at
last, when the children were quite giddy, he settled down, with a
rattling of all his scales, on the top of a mountain. And he lay there
on his great green scaly side, panting, and very much out of breath,
because he had come such a long way. But his claws were fast in Effie's
sash and the little point at the back of Harry's Eton jacket.

Then Effie took out the knife Harry had given her on her birthday. It
had cost only sixpence to begin with, and she had had it a month, and it
never could sharpen anything but slate-pencils; but somehow she managed
to make that knife cut her sash in front, and crept out of it, leaving
the dragon with only a green silk bow in one of his claws. That knife
would never have cut Harry's jacket-tail off, though, and when Effie had
tried for some time she saw that this was so and gave it up. But with
her help Harry managed to wriggle quietly out of his sleeves, so that
the dragon had only an Eton jacket in his other claw. Then the children
crept on tiptoe to a crack in the rocks and got in. It was much too
narrow for the dragon to get in also, so they stayed in there and waited
to make faces at the dragon when he felt rested enough to sit up and
begin to think about eating them. He was very angry, indeed, when they
made faces at him, and blew out fire and smoke at them, but they ran
farther into the cave so that he could not reach them, and when he was
tired of blowing he went away.

But they were afraid to come out of the cave, so they went farther in,
and presently the cave opened out and grew bigger, and the floor was
soft sand, and when they had come to the very end of the cave there was
a door, and on it was written: UNIVERSAL TAPROOM. PRIVATE. NO ONE
ALLOWED INSIDE.

So they opened the door at once just to peep in, and then they
remembered what St. George had said.

"We can't be worse off than we are," said Harry, "with a dragon waiting
for us outside. Let's go in."

They went boldly into the taproom, and shut the door behind them.

And now they were in a sort of room cut out of the solid rock, and all
along one side of the room were taps, and all the taps were labeled with
china labels like you see in baths. And as they could both read words of
two syllables or even three sometimes, they understood at once that they
had gotten to the place where the weather is turned on from. There were
six big taps labeled "Sunshine," "Wind," "Rain," "Snow," "Hail," "Ice,"
and a lot of little ones, labeled "Fair to moderate," "Showery," "South
breeze," "Nice growing weather for the crops," "Skating," "Good open
weather," "South wind," "East wind," and so on. And the big tap labeled
"Sunshine" was turned full on. They could not see any sunshine--the cave
was lighted by a skylight of blue glass--so they supposed the sunlight
was pouring out by some other way, as it does with the tap that washes
out the underneath parts of patent sinks in kitchens.

Then they saw that one side of the room was just a big looking glass,
and when you looked in it you could see everything that was going on in
the world--and all at once, too, which is not like most looking glasses.
They saw the carts delivering the dead dragons at the County Council
offices, and they saw St. George asleep under the dragonproof veil. And
they saw their mother at home crying because her children had gone out
in the dreadful, dangerous daylight, and she was afraid a dragon had
eaten them. And they saw the whole of England, like a great puzzle
map--green in the field parts and brown in the towns, and black in the
places where they make coal and crockery and cutlery and chemicals. All
over it, on the black parts, and on the brown, and on the green, there
was a network of green dragons. And they could see that it was still
broad daylight, and no dragons had gone to bed yet.

Effie said, "Dragons do not like cold." And she tried to turn off the
sunshine, but the tap was out of order, and that was why there had been
so much hot weather, and why the dragons had been able to be hatched. So
they left the sunshine tap alone, and they turned on the snow and left
the tap full on while they went to look in the glass. There they saw the
dragons running all sorts of ways like ants if you are cruel enough to
pour water into an ant-heap, which, of course, you never are. And the
snow fell more and more.

Then Effie turned the rain tap quite full on, and presently the dragons
began to wriggle less, and by-and-by some of them lay quite still, so
the children knew the water had put out the fires inside them, and they
were dead. So then they turned on the hail--only half on, for fear of
breaking people's windows--and after a while there were no more dragons
to be seen moving.

Then the children knew that they were indeed the deliverers of their
country.

"They will put up a monument to us," said Harry, "as high as Nelson's!
All the dragons are dead."

"I hope the one that was waiting outside for us is dead!" said Effie.
"And about the monument, Harry, I'm not so sure. What can they do with
such a lot of dead dragons? It would take years and years to bury them,
and they could never be burnt now they are so soaking wet. I wish the
rain would wash them off into the sea."

But this did not happen, and the children began to feel that they had
not been so frightfully clever after all.

"I wonder what this old thing's for," said Harry. He had found a rusty
old tap, which seemed as though it had not been used for ages. Its china
label was quite coated over with dirt and cobwebs. When Effie had
cleaned it with a bit of her skirt--for curiously enough both the
children had come out without pocket handkerchiefs--she found that the
label said "Waste."

"Let's turn it on," she said. "It might carry off the dragons."

The tap was very stiff from not having been used for such a long time,
but together they managed to turn it on, and then ran to the mirror to
see what happened.

Already a great, round black hole had opened in the very middle of the
map of England, and the sides of the map were tilting themselves up, so
that the rain ran down toward the hole.

"Oh, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!" cried Effie, and she hurried back to the
taps and turned on everything that seemed wet. "Showery," "Good open
weather," "Nice growing weather for the crops," and even "South" and
"South-West," because she had heard her father say that those winds
brought rain.

And now the floods of rain were pouring down on the country, and great
sheets of water flowed toward the center of the map, and cataracts of
water poured into the great round hole in the middle of the map, and the
dragons were being washed away and disappearing down the waste pipe in
great green masses and scattered green shoals--single dragons and
dragons by the dozen; of all sizes, from the ones that carry off
elephants down to the ones that get in your tea.

Presently there was not a dragon left. So then they turned off the tap
named "Waste," and they half-turned off the one labeled "Sunshine"--it
was broken, so that they could not turn it off altogether--and they
turned on "Fair to moderate" and "Showery" and both taps stuck, so that
they could not be turned off, which accounts for our climate.

       *       *       *       *       *

How did they get home again? By the Snowdon railway of course.

And was the nation grateful? Well--the nation was very wet. And by the
time the nation had gotten dry again it was interested in the new
invention for toasting muffins by electricity, and all the dragons were
almost forgotten. Dragons do not seem so important when they are dead
and gone, and, you know, there never was a reward offered.

And what did Father and Mother say when Effie and Harry got home?

My dear, that is the sort of silly question you children always will
ask. However, just for this once I don't mind telling you.

Mother said: "Oh, my darlings, my darlings, you're safe--you're safe!
You naughty children--how could you be so disobedient? Go to bed at
once!"

And their father the doctor said: "I wish I had known what you were
going to do! I should have liked to preserve a specimen. I threw away
the one I got out of Effie's eye. I intended to get a more perfect
specimen. I did not anticipate this immediate extinction of the
species."

The professor said nothing, but he rubbed his hands. He had kept his
specimen--the one the size of an earwig that he gave Harry half a crown
for--and he has it to this day.

You must get him to show it to you!




[Illustration: THE ICE DRAGON]




IV. The Ice Dragon, or Do as You Are Told


This is the tale of the wonders that befell on the evening of the
eleventh of December, when they did what they were told not to do. You
may think that you know all the unpleasant things that could possibly
happen to you if you are disobedient, but there are some things which
even you do not know, and they did not know them either.

Their names were George and Jane.

There were no fireworks that year on Guy Fawkes' Day, because the heir
to the throne was not well. He was cutting his first tooth, and that is
a very anxious time for any person--even for a Royal one. He was really
very poorly, so that fireworks would have been in the worst possible
taste, even at Land's End or in the Isle of Man, whilst in Forest Hill,
which was the home of Jane and George, anything of the kind was quite
out of the question. Even the Crystal Palace, empty-headed as it is,
felt that this was no time for Catherine-wheels.

But when the Prince had cut his tooth, rejoicings were not only
admissible but correct, and the eleventh of December was proclaimed
firework day. All the people were most anxious to show their loyalty,
and to enjoy themselves at the same time. So there were fireworks and
torchlight processions, and set pieces at the Crystal Palace, with
"Blessings on our Prince" and "Long Live our Royal Darling" in
different-colored fires; and the most private of boarding schools had a
half holiday; and even the children of plumbers and authors had tuppence
each given them to spend as they liked.

George and Jane had sixpence each--and they spent the whole amount on a
golden rain, which would not light for ever so long, and when it did
light went out almost at once, so they had to look at the fireworks in
the gardens next door, and at the ones at the Crystal Palace, which were
very glorious indeed.

All their relations had colds in their heads, so Jane and George were
allowed to go out into the garden alone to let off their firework. Jane
had put on her fur cape and her thick gloves, and her hood with the
silver fox fur on it that was made out of Mother's old muff; and George
had his overcoat with the three capes, and his comforter, and Father's
sealskin traveling cap with the pieces that come down over your ears.

It was dark in the garden, but the fireworks all about made it seem very
gay, and though the children were cold they were quite sure that they
were enjoying themselves.

They got up on the fence at the end of the garden to see better; and
then they saw, very far away, where the edge of the dark world is, a
shining line of straight, beautiful lights arranged in a row, as if they
were the spears carried by a fairy army.

"Oh, how pretty," said Jane. "I wonder what they are. It looks as if the
fairies were planting little shining baby poplar trees and watering them
with liquid light."

"Liquid fiddlestick!" said George. He had been to school, so he knew
that these were only the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights. And he
said so.

"But what is the Rory Bory what's-its-name?" asked Jane. "Who lights it,
and what's it there for?"

George had to own that he had not learned that.

"But I know," said he, "that it has something to do with the Great Bear,
and the Dipper, and the Plough, and Charles's Wain."

"And what are they?" asked Jane.

"Oh, they're the surnames of some of the star families. There goes a
jolly rocket," answered George, and Jane felt as if she almost
understood about the star families.

The fairy spears of light twinkled and gleamed: They were much prettier
than the big, blaring, blazing bonfire that was smoking and flaming and
spluttering in the next-door-but-one garden--prettier even than the
colored fires at the Crystal Palace.

"I wish we could see them nearer," Jane said. "I wonder if the star
families are nice families--the kind that Mother would like us to go to
tea with, if we were little stars?"

"They aren't that sort of families at all, Silly," said her brother,
kindly trying to explain. "I only said 'families' because a kid like you
wouldn't have understood if I'd said constel ... and, besides, I've
forgotten the end of the word. Anyway, the stars are all up in the sky,
so you can't go to tea with them."

"No," said Jane. "I said if we were little stars."

"But we aren't," said George.

"No," said Jane, with a sigh. "I know that. I'm not so stupid as you
think, George. But the Tory Bories are somewhere at the edge. Couldn't
we go and see them?"

"Considering you're eight, you haven't much sense." George kicked his
boots against the fencing to warm his toes. "It's half the world away."

"It looks very near," said Jane, hunching up her shoulders to keep her
neck warm.

"They're close to the North Pole," said George. "Look here--I don't care
a straw about the Aurora Borealis, but I shouldn't mind discovering the
North Pole: It's awfully difficult and dangerous, and then you come home
and write a book about it with a lot of pictures, and everybody says how
brave you are."

Jane got off the fence.

"Oh, George, _let's_," she said. "We shall never have such a chance
again--all alone by ourselves--and quite late, too."

"I'd go right enough if it wasn't for you," George answered gloomily,
"but you know they always say I lead you into mischief--and if we went
to the North Pole we should get our boots wet, as likely as not, and
you remember what they said about not going on the grass."

"They said the _lawn_," said Jane. "We're not going on the _lawn_. Oh,
George, do, do let's. It doesn't look so _very_ far--we could be back
before they had time to get dreadfully angry."

"All right," said George, "but mind, I don't want to go."

So off they went. They got over the fence, which was very cold and white
and shiny because it was beginning to freeze, and on the other side of
the fence was somebody else's garden, so they got out of that as quickly
as they could, and beyond that was a field where there was another big
bonfire, with people standing around it who looked quite dark-skinned.

"It's like Indians," said George, and wanted to stop and look, but Jane
pulled him on, and they passed by the bonfire and got through a gap in
the hedge into another field--a dark one; and far away, beyond quite a
number of other dark fields, the Northern Lights shone and sparkled and
twinkled.

Now, during the winter the Arctic regions come much farther south than
they are marked on the map. Very few people know this, though you would
think they could tell it by the ice in the jugs of a morning. And just
when George and Jane were starting for the North Pole, the Arctic
regions had come down very nearly as far as Forest Hill, so that, as the
children walked on, it grew colder and colder, and presently they saw
that the fields were covered with snow, and there were great icicles
hanging from all the hedges and gates. And the Northern Lights still
seemed some way off.

They were crossing a very rough, snowy field when Jane first noticed the
animals. There were white rabbits and white hares and all sorts and
sizes of white birds, and some larger creatures in the shadows of the
hedges that Jane was sure were wolves and bears.

"Polar bears and Arctic wolves, of course I mean," she said, for she did
not want George to think her stupid again.

There was a great hedge at the end of this field, all covered with snow
and icicles; but the children found a place where there was a hole, and
as no bears or wolves seemed to be just in that part of the hedge, they
crept through and scrambled out of the frozen ditch on the other side.
And then they stood still and held their breath with wonder.

For in front of them, running straight and smooth right away to the
Northern Lights, lay a great wide road of pure dark ice, and on each
side were tall trees all sparkling with white frost, and from the boughs
of the trees hung strings of stars threaded on fine moonbeams, and
shining so brightly that it was like a beautiful fairy daylight. Jane
said so; but George said it was like the electric lights at the Earl's
Court Exhibition.

The rows of trees went as straight as ruled lines away--away and
away--and at the other end of them shone the Aurora Borealis.

There was a signpost of silvery snow, and on it in letters of pure ice
the children read: THIS WAY TO THE NORTH POLE.

Then George said: "Way or no way, I know a slide when I see one--so here
goes." And he took a run on the frozen snow, and Jane took a run when
she saw him do it, and the next moment they were sliding away, each with
feet half a yard apart, along the great slide that leads to the North
Pole.

This great slide is made for the convenience of the Polar bears, who,
during the winter months, get their food from the Army and Navy
Stores--and it is the most perfect slide in the world. If you have never
come across it, it is because you have never let off fireworks on the
eleventh of December, and have never been thoroughly naughty and
disobedient. But do not be these things in the hope of finding the great
slide--because you might find something quite different, and then you
will be sorry.

The great slide is like common slides in that when once you have started
you have to go on to the end--unless you fall down--and then it hurts
just as much as the smaller kind on ponds. The great slide runs
downhill all the way, so that you keep on going faster and faster and
faster. George and Jane went so fast that they had not time to notice
the scenery. They only saw the long lines of frosted trees and the
starry lamps, and on each side, rushing back as they slid on, a very
broad, white world and a very large, black night; and overhead as well
as in the trees the stars were bright like silver lamps, and far ahead
shone and trembled and sparkled the line of fairy spears. Jane said
that, and George said: "I can see the Northern Lights quite plain."

It is very pleasant to slide and slide and slide on clear, dark
ice--especially if you feel you are really going somewhere, and more
especially if that somewhere is the North Pole. The children's feet made
no noise on the ice, and they went on and on in a beautiful white
silence. But suddenly the silence was shattered and a cry rang out over
the snow.

"Hey! You there! Stop!"

"Tumble for your life!" cried George, and he fell down at once, because
it is the only way to stop. Jane fell on top of him--and then they
crawled on hands and knees to the snow at the edge of the slide--and
there was a sportsman, dressed in a peaked cap and a frozen moustache,
like the one you see in the pictures about Ice-Peter, and he had a gun
in his hand.

"You don't happen to have any bullets about you?" said he.

"No," George said, truthfully. "I had five of father's revolver
cartridges, but they were taken away the day Nurse turned out my pockets
to see if I had taken the knob of the bathroom door by mistake."

"Quite so," said the sportsman, "these accidents will occur. You don't
carry firearms, then, I presume?"

"I haven't any fire_arms_," said George, "but I have a fire_work_. It's
only a squib one of the boys gave me, if that's any good." And he began
to feel among the string and peppermints, and buttons and tops and nibs
and chalk and foreign postage stamps in his knickerbocker pockets.

"One could but try," the sportsman replied, and he held out his hand.

But Jane pulled at her brother's jacket-tail and whispered, "Ask him
what he wants it for."

So then the sportsman had to confess that he wanted the firework to kill
the white grouse with; and, when they came to look, there was the white
grouse himself, sitting in the snow, looking quite pale and careworn,
and waiting anxiously for the matter to be decided one way or the other.

George put all the things back in his pockets, and said, "No, I shan't.
The reason for shooting him stopped yesterday--I heard Father say so--so
it wouldn't be fair, anyhow. I'm very sorry; but I can't--so there!"

The sportsman said nothing, only he shook his fist at Jane, and then he
got on the slide and tried to go toward the Crystal Palace--which was
not easy, because that way is uphill. So they left him trying, and went
on.

Before they started, the white grouse thanked them in a few pleasant,
well-chosen words, and then they took a sideways slanting run and
started off again on the great slide, and so away toward the North Pole
and the twinkling, beautiful lights.

The great slide went on and on, and the lights did not seem to come much
nearer, and the white silence wrapped around them as they slid along the
wide, icy path. Then once again the silence was broken to bits by
someone calling: "Hey! You there! Stop!"

"Tumble for your life!" cried George, and tumbled as before, stopping in
the only possible way, and Jane stopped on top of him, and they crawled
to the edge and came suddenly on a butterfly collector, who was looking
for specimens with a pair of blue glasses and a blue net and a blue book
with colored plates.

"Excuse me," said the collector, "but have you such a thing as a needle
about you--a very long needle?"

"I have a needle _book_," replied Jane, politely, "but there aren't any
needles in it now. George took them all to do the things with pieces of
cork--in the 'Boy's Own Scientific Experimenter' and 'The Young
Mechanic.' He did not do the things, but he did for the needles."

"Curiously enough," said the collector, "I too wish to use the needle in
connection with cork."

"I have a hatpin in my hood," said Jane. "I fastened the fur with it
when it caught in the nail on the greenhouse door. It is very long and
sharp--would that do?"

"One could but try," said the collector, and Jane began to feel for the
pin. But George pinched her arm and whispered, "Ask what he wants it
for." Then the collector had to own that he wanted the pin to stick
through the great Arctic moth, "a magnificent specimen," he added,
"which I am most anxious to preserve."

And there, sure enough, in the collector's butterfly net sat the great
Arctic moth, listening attentively to the conversation.

"Oh, I couldn't!" cried Jane. And while George was explaining to the
collector that they would really rather not, Jane opened the blue folds
of the butterfly net, and asked the moth quietly if it would please step
outside for a moment. And it did.

When the collector saw that the moth was free, he seemed less angry than
grieved.

"Well, well," said he, "here's a whole Arctic expedition thrown away! I
shall have to go home and fit out another. And that means a lot of
writing to the papers and things. You seem to be a singularly
thoughtless little girl."

So they went on, leaving him too, trying to go uphill towards the
Crystal Palace.

When the great white Arctic moth had returned thanks in a suitable
speech, George and Jane took a sideways slanting run and started sliding
again, between the star-lamps along the great slide toward the North
Pole. They went faster and faster, and the lights ahead grew brighter
and brighter--so that they could not keep their eyes open, but had to
blink and wink as they went--and then suddenly the great slide ended in
an immense heap of snow, and George and Jane shot right into it because
they could not stop themselves, and the snow was soft, so that they went
in up to their very ears.

When they had picked themselves out and thumped each other on the back
to get rid of the snow, they shaded their eyes and looked, and there,
right in front of them, was the wonder of wonders--the North
Pole--towering high and white and glistening, like an ice-lighthouse,
and it was quite, quite close, so that you had to put your head as far
back as it would go, and farther, before you could see the high top of
it. It was made entirely of ice. You will hear grown-up people talk a
great deal of nonsense about the North Pole, and when you are grown up,
it is even possible that you may talk nonsense about it yourself (the
most unlikely things do happen) but deep down in your heart you must
always remember that the North Pole is made of clear ice, and could not
possibly, if you come to think of it, be made of anything else.

All around the Pole, making a bright ring about it, were hundreds of
little fires, and the flames of them did not flicker and twist, but went
up blue and green and rosy and straight like the stalks of dream lilies.

Jane said so, but George said they were as straight as ramrods.

And these flames were the Aurora Borealis, which the children had seen
as far away as Forest Hill.

The ground was quite flat, and covered with smooth, hard snow, which
shone and sparkled like the top of a birthday cake that has been iced at
home. The ones done at the shops do not shine and sparkle, because they
mix flour with the icing sugar.

"It is like a dream," said Jane.

And George said, "It _is_ the North Pole. Just think of the fuss people
always make about getting here--and it was no trouble at all, really."

"I daresay lots of people have gotten here," said Jane, dismally. "It's
not the getting _here_--I see that--it's the getting back again.
Perhaps no one will ever know that _we_ have been here, and the robins
will cover us with leaves and--"

"Nonsense," said George. "There aren't any robins, and there aren't any
leaves. It's just the North Pole, that's all, and I've found it; and now
I shall try to climb up and plant the British flag on the top--my
handkerchief will do; and if it really _is_ the North Pole, my pocket
compass Uncle James gave me will spin around and around, and then I
shall know. Come on."

So Jane came on; and when they got close to the clear, tall, beautiful
flames they saw that there was a great, queer-shaped lump of ice all
around the bottom of the Pole--clear, smooth, shining ice, that was
deep, beautiful Prussian blue, like icebergs, in the thick parts, and
all sorts of wonderful, glimmery, shimmery, changing colors in the thin
parts, like the cut-glass chandelier in Grandmamma's house in London.

"It is a very curious shape," said Jane. "It's almost like"--she moved
back a step to get a better view of it--"it's almost like a dragon."

"It's much more like the lampposts on the Thames Embankment," said
George, who had noticed a curly thing like a tail that went twisting up
the North Pole.

"Oh, George," cried Jane, "it _is_ a dragon; I can see its wings.
Whatever shall we do?"

And, sure enough, it _was_ a dragon--a great, shining, winged, scaly,
clawy, big-mouthed dragon--made of pure ice. It must have gone to sleep
curled around the hole where the warm steam used to come up from the
middle of the earth, and then when the earth got colder, and the column
of steam froze and was turned into the North Pole, the dragon must have
got frozen in his sleep--frozen too hard to move--and there he stayed.
And though he was very terrible he was very beautiful too.

Jane said so, but George said, "Oh, don't bother; I'm thinking how to
get onto the Pole and try the compass without waking the brute."

[Illustration: "Sure enough, it was a dragon." _See page 68._]

The dragon certainly was beautiful, with his deep, clear Prussian
blueness, and his rainbow-colored glitter. And rising from within the
cold coil of the frozen dragon the North Pole shot up like a pillar made
of one great diamond, and every now and then it cracked a little, from
sheer cold. The sound of the cracking was the only thing that broke the
great white silence in the midst of which the dragon lay like an
enormous jewel, and the straight flames went up all around him like the
stalks of tall lilies.

And as the children stood there looking at the most wonderful sight
their eyes had ever seen, there was a soft padding of feet and a
hurry-scurry behind them, and from the outside darkness beyond the
flame-stalks came a crowd of little brown creatures running, jumping,
scrambling, tumbling head over heels and on all fours, and some even
walking on their heads. They joined hands as they came near the fires
and danced around in a ring.

"It's bears," said Jane. "I know it is. Oh, how I wish we hadn't come;
and my boots are so wet."

The dancing-ring broke up suddenly, and the next moment hundreds of
furry arms clutched at George and Jane, and they found themselves in the
middle of a great, soft, heaving crowd of little fat people in brown fur
dresses, and the white silence was quite gone.

"Bears, indeed," cried a shrill voice. "You'll wish we were bears before
you've done with us."

This sounded so dreadful that Jane began to cry. Up to now the children
had only seen the most beautiful and wondrous things, but now they began
to be sorry they had done what they were told not to, and the difference
between "lawn" and "grass" did not seem so great as it had at Forest
Hill.

Directly Jane began to cry, all the brown people started back. No one
cries in the Arctic regions for fear of being struck by the frost. So
that these people had never seen anyone cry before.

"Don't cry for real," whispered George, "or you'll get chilblains in
your eyes. But pretend to howl--it frightens them."

So Jane went on pretending to howl, and the real crying stopped: It
always does when you begin to pretend. You try it.

Then, speaking very loud so as to be heard over the howls of Jane,
George said: "Yah--who's afraid? We are George and Jane--who are you?"

"We are the sealskin dwarfs," said the brown people, twisting their
furry bodies in and out of the crowd like the changing glass in
kaleidoscopes. "We are very precious and expensive, for we are made,
throughout, of the very best sealskin."

"And what are those fires for?" bellowed George--for Jane was crying
louder and louder.

"Those," shouted the dwarfs, coming a step nearer, "are the fires we
make to thaw the dragon. He is frozen now--so he sleeps curled up around
the Pole--but when we have thawed him with our fires he will wake up and
go and eat everybody in the world except us."

"WHATEVER--DO--YOU--WANT--HIM--TO--DO--THAT--FOR?" yelled George.

"Oh--just for spite," bawled the dwarfs carelessly--as if they were
saying, "Just for fun."

Jane stopped crying to say: "You are heartless."

"No, we aren't," they said. "Our hearts are made of the finest sealskin,
just like little fat sealskin purses--"

And they all came a step nearer. They were very fat and round. Their
bodies were like sealskin jackets on a very stout person; their heads
were like sealskin muffs; their legs were like sealskin boas; and their
hands and feet were like sealskin tobacco pouches. And their faces were
like seals' faces, inasmuch as they, too, were covered with sealskin.

"Thank you so much for telling us," said George. "Good evening. (Keep on
howling, Jane!)"

But the dwarfs came a step nearer, muttering and whispering. Then the
muttering stopped--and there was a silence so deep that Jane was afraid
to howl in it. But it was a brown silence, and she had liked the white
silence better.

Then the chief dwarf came quite close and said: "What's that on your
head?"

And George felt it was all up--for he knew it was his father's sealskin
cap.

The dwarf did not wait for an answer. "It's made of one of us," he
screamed, "or else one of the seals, our poor relations. Boy, now your
fate is sealed!"

Looking at the wicked seal-faces all around them, George and Jane felt
that their fate was sealed indeed.

The dwarfs seized the children in their furry arms. George kicked, but
it is no use kicking sealskin, and Jane howled, but the dwarfs were
getting used to that. They climbed up the dragon's side and dumped the
children down on his icy spine, with their backs against the North Pole.
You have no idea how cold it was--the kind of cold that makes you feel
small and prickly inside your clothes, and makes you wish you had twenty
times as many clothes to feel small and prickly inside of.

The sealskin dwarfs tied George and Jane to the North Pole, and, as they
had no ropes, they bound them with snow-wreaths, which are very strong
when they are made in the proper way, and they heaped up the fires very
close and said: "Now the dragon will get warm, and when he gets warm he
will wake, and when he wakes he will be hungry, and when he is hungry he
will begin to eat, and the first thing he will eat will be you."

The little, sharp, many-colored flames sprang up like the stalks of
dream lilies, but no heat came to the children, and they grew colder and
colder.

"We shan't be very nice when the dragon does eat us, that's one
comfort," said George. "We shall be turned into ice long before that."

Suddenly there was a flapping of wings, and the white grouse perched on
the dragon's head and said: "Can I be of any assistance?"

[Illustration: "The dwarfs seized the children." _See page 72._]

Now, by this time the children were so cold, so cold, so very, very
cold, that they had forgotten everything but that, and they could say
nothing else. So the white grouse said: "One moment. I am only too
grateful for this opportunity of showing my sense of your manly conduct
about the firework!"

And the next moment there was a soft whispering rustle of wings
overhead, and then, fluttering slowly, softly down, came hundreds and
thousands of little white fluffy feathers. They fell on George and Jane
like snowflakes, and, like flakes of fallen snow lying one above
another, they grew into a thicker and thicker covering, so that
presently the children were buried under a heap of white feathers, and
only their faces peeped out.

"Oh, you dear, good, kind white grouse," said Jane, "but you'll be cold
yourself, won't you, now you have given us all your pretty dear
feathers?"

The white grouse laughed, and his laugh was echoed by thousands of kind,
soft bird voices.

"Did you think all those feathers came out of one breast? There are
hundreds and hundreds of us here, and every one of us can spare a little
tuft of soft breast feathers to help to keep two kind little hearts
warm!"

Thus spoke the grouse, who certainly had very pretty manners.

So now the children snuggled under the feathers and were warm, and when
the sealskin dwarfs tried to take the feathers away, the grouse and his
friends flew in their faces with flappings and screams, and drove the
dwarfs back. They are a cowardly folk.

The dragon had not moved yet--but then he might at any moment get warm
enough to move, and though George and Jane were now warm they were not
comfortable nor easy in their minds. They tried to explain to the
grouse; but though he is polite, he is not clever, and he only said:
"You've got a warm nest, and we'll see that no one takes it from you.
What more can you possibly want?"

Just then came a new, strange, jerky fluttering of wings far softer
than the grouse's, and George and Jane cried out together: "Oh, _do_
mind your wings in the fires!"

For they saw at once that it was the great white Arctic moth.

"What's the matter?" he asked, settling on the dragon's tail.

So they told him.

"Sealskin, are they?" said the moth. "Just you wait a minute!"

He flew off very crookedly, dodging the flames, and presently he came
back, and there were so many moths with him that it was as if a live
sheet of white wingedness were suddenly drawn between the children and
the stars.

And then the doom of the bad sealskin dwarfs fell suddenly on them.

For the great sheet of winged whiteness broke up and fell as snow falls,
and it fell upon the sealskin dwarfs; and every snowflake of it was a
live, fluttering, hungry moth that buried its greedy nose deep in the
sealskin fur.

Grown-up people will tell you that it is not moths but moths' children
who eat fur--but this is only when they are trying to deceive you. When
they are not thinking about you they say, "I fear the moths have got at
my ermine tippet," or, "Your poor Aunt Emma had a lovely sable cloak,
but it was eaten by moths." And now there were more moths than have ever
been together in this world before, all settling on the sealskin dwarfs.

The dwarfs did not see their danger till it was too late. Then they
called for camphor and bitter apple and oil of lavender and yellow soap
and borax; and some of the dwarfs even started to get these things, but
long before any of them could get to the chemist's, all was over. The
moths ate and ate and ate till the sealskin dwarfs, being sealskin
throughout, even to the empty hearts of them, were eaten down to the
very life--and they fell one by one on the snow and so came to their
end. And all around the North Pole the snow was brown with their flat
bare pelts.

"Oh, thank you--thank you, darling Arctic moth," cried Jane. "You are
good--I do hope you haven't eaten enough to disagree with you
afterward!"

Millions of moth voices answered, with laughter as soft as moth wings,
"We should be a poor set of fellows if we couldn't over eat ourselves
once in a while--to oblige a friend."

And off they all fluttered, and the white grouse flew off, and the
sealskin dwarfs were all dead, and the fires went out, and George and
Jane were left alone in the dark with the dragon!

"Oh, dear," said Jane, "this is the worst of all!"

"We've no friends left to help us," said George. He never thought that
the dragon himself might help them--but then that was an idea that would
never have occurred to any boy.

It grew colder and colder and colder, and even under the grouse feathers
the children shivered.

Then, when it was so cold that it could not manage to be any colder
without breaking the thermometer, it stopped. And then the dragon
uncurled himself from around the North Pole, and stretched his long, icy
length over the snow, and said: "This is something like! How faint those
fires did make me feel!"

The fact was, the sealskin dwarfs had gone the wrong way to work: The
dragon had been frozen so long that now he was nothing but solid ice all
through, and the fires only made him feel as if he were going to die.

But when the fires were out he felt quite well, and very hungry. He
looked around for something to eat. But he never noticed George and
Jane, because they were frozen to his back.

He moved slowly off, and the snow-wreaths that bound the children to the
Pole gave way with a snap, and there was the dragon, crawling
south--with Jane and George on his great, scaly, icy shining back. Of
course the dragon had to go south if he went anywhere, because when you
get to the North Pole there is no other way to go. The dragon rattled
and tinkled as he went, exactly like the cut-glass chandelier when you
touch it, as you are strictly forbidden to do. Of course there are a
million ways of going south from the North Pole--so you will own that it
was lucky for George and Jane when the dragon took the right way and
suddenly got his heavy feet on the great slide. Off he went, full speed,
between the starry lamps, toward Forest Hill and the Crystal Palace.

"He's going to take us home," said Jane. "Oh, he is a good dragon. I
_am_ glad!"

George was rather glad too, though neither of the children felt at all
sure of their welcome, especially as their feet were wet, and they were
bringing a strange dragon home with them.

They went very fast, because dragons can go uphill as easily as down.
You would not understand why if I told you--because you are only in long
division at present; yet if you want me to tell you, so that you can
show off to other children, I will. It is because dragons can get their
tails into the fourth dimension and hold on there, and when you can do
that everything else is easy.

The dragon went very fast, only stopping to eat the collector and the
sportsman, who were still struggling to go up the slide--vainly, because
they had no tails, and had never even heard of the fourth dimension.

When the dragon got to the end of the slide he crawled very slowly
across the dark field beyond the field where there was a bonfire, next
to the next-door garden at Forest Hill.

       *       *       *       *       *

He went slower and slower, and in the bonfire field he stopped
altogether, and because the Arctic regions had not got down so far as
that, and because the bonfire was very hot, the dragon began to melt and
melt and melt--and before the children knew what he was doing they found
themselves sitting in a large pool of water, and their boots were as wet
as wet, and there was not a bit of dragon left!

So they went indoors.

Of course some grown-up or other noticed at once that the boots of
George and Jane were wet and muddy, and that they had both been sitting
down in a very damp place, so they were sent to bed immediately.

It was long past their time, anyhow.

Now, if you are of an inquiring mind--not at all a nice thing in a
little child who reads fairy tales--you will want to know how it is that
since the sealskin dwarfs have all been killed, and the fires all been
let out, the Aurora Borealis shines, on cold nights, as brightly as
ever.

My dear, I do not know! I am not too proud to own that there are some
things I know nothing about--and this is one of them. But I do know that
whoever has lighted those fires again, it is certainly not the sealskin
dwarfs. They were all eaten by moths--and motheaten things are of no
use, even to light fires!




[Illustration: THE ISLAND OF THE NINE WHIRLPOOLS]




V. The Island of the Nine Whirlpools


The dark arch that led to the witch's cave was hung with a
black-and-yellow fringe of live snakes. As the Queen went in, keeping
carefully in the middle of the arch, all the snakes lifted their wicked,
flat heads and stared at her with their wicked, yellow eyes. You know it
is not good manners to stare, even at Royalty, except of course for
cats. And the snakes had been so badly brought up that they even put
their tongues out at the poor lady. Nasty, thin, sharp tongues they were
too.

Now, the Queen's husband was, of course, the King. And besides being a
King he was an enchanter, and considered to be quite at the top of his
profession, so he was very wise, and he knew that when Kings and Queens
want children, the Queen always goes to see a witch. So he gave the
Queen the witch's address, and the Queen called on her, though she was
very frightened and did not like it at all. The witch was sitting by a
fire of sticks, stirring something bubbly in a shiny copper cauldron.

"What do you want, my dear?" she said to the Queen.

"Oh, if you please," said the Queen, "I want a baby--a very nice one. We
don't want any expense spared. My husband said--"

"Oh, yes," said the witch. "I know all about him. And so you want a
child? Do you know it will bring you sorrow?"

"It will bring me joy first," said the Queen.

"Great sorrow," said the witch.

"Greater joy," said the Queen.

Then the witch said, "Well, have your own way. I suppose it's as much as
your place is worth to go back without it?"

"The King would be very much annoyed," said the poor Queen.

"Well, well," said the witch. "What will you give me for the child?"

"Anything you ask for, and all I have," said the Queen.

"Then give me your gold crown."

The Queen took it off quickly.

"And your necklace of blue sapphires."

The Queen unfastened it.

"And your pearl bracelets."

The Queen unclasped them.

"And your ruby clasps."

And the Queen undid the clasps.

"Now the lilies from your breast."

The Queen gathered together the lilies.

"And the diamonds of your little bright shoe buckles."

The Queen pulled off her shoes.

Then the witch stirred the stuff that was in the cauldron, and, one by
one, she threw in the gold crown and the sapphire necklace and the pearl
bracelets and the ruby clasps and the diamonds of the little bright shoe
buckles, and last of all she threw in the lilies.

The stuff in the cauldron boiled up in foaming flashes of yellow and
blue and red and white and silver, and sent out a sweet scent, and
presently the witch poured it out into a pot and set it to cool in the
doorway among the snakes.

Then she said to the Queen: "Your child will have hair as golden as your
crown, eyes as blue as your sapphires. The red of your rubies will lie
on its lips, and its skin will be clear and pale as your pearls. Its
soul will be white and sweet as your lilies, and your diamonds will be
no clearer than its wits."

"Oh, thank you, thank you," said the Queen, "and when will it come?"

"You will find it when you get home."

"And won't you have something for yourself?" asked the Queen. "Any
little thing you fancy--would you like a country, or a sack of jewels?"

"Nothing, thank you," said the witch. "I could make more diamonds in a
day than I should wear in a year."

"Well, but do let me do some little thing for you," the Queen went on.
"Aren't you tired of being a witch? Wouldn't you like to be a Duchess or
a Princess, or something like that?"

"There is one thing I should rather like," said the witch, "but it's
hard to get in my trade."

"Oh, tell me what," said the Queen.

"I should like some one to love me," said the witch.

Then the Queen threw her arms around the witch's neck and kissed her
half a hundred times. "Why," she said, "I love you better than my life!
You've given me the baby--and the baby shall love you too."

"Perhaps it will," said the witch, "and when the sorrow comes, send for
me. Each of your fifty kisses will be a spell to bring me to you. Now,
drink up your medicine, there's a dear, and run along home."

So the Queen drank the stuff in the pot, which was quite cool by this
time, and she went out under the fringe of snakes, and they all behaved
like good Sunday-school children. Some of them even tried to drop a
curtsy to her as she went by, though that is not easy when you are
hanging wrong way up by your tail. But the snakes knew the Queen was
friends with their mistress; so, of course, they had to do their best to
be civil.

When the Queen got home, sure enough there was the baby lying in the
cradle with the Royal arms blazoned on it, crying as naturally as
possible. It had pink ribbons to tie up its sleeves, so the Queen saw at
once it was a girl. When the King knew this he tore his black hair with
fury.

"Oh, you silly, silly Queen!" he said. "Why didn't I marry a clever
lady? Did you think I went to all the trouble and expense of sending you
to a witch to get a girl? You knew well enough it was a boy I wanted--a
boy, an heir, a Prince--to learn all my magic and my enchantments, and
to rule the kingdom after me. I'll bet a crown--my crown," he said, "you
never even thought to tell the witch what kind you wanted! Did you now?"

And the Queen hung her head and had to confess that she had only asked
for a child.

"Very well, madam," said the King, "very well--have your own way. And
make the most of your daughter, while she is a child."

The Queen did. All the years of her life had never held half so much
happiness as now lived in each of the moments when she held her little
baby in her arms. And the years went on, and the King grew more and more
clever at magic, and more and more disagreeable at home, and the
Princess grew more beautiful and more dear every day she lived.

The Queen and the Princess were feeding the goldfish in the courtyard
fountains with crumbs of the Princess's eighteenth birthday cake, when
the King came into the courtyard, looking as black as thunder, with his
black raven hopping after him. He shook his fist at his family, as
indeed he generally did whenever he met them, for he was not a King with
pretty home manners. The raven sat down on the edge of the marble basin
and tried to peck the goldfish. It was all he could do to show that he
was in the same temper as his master.

"A girl indeed!" said the King angrily. "I wonder you can dare to look
me in the face, when you remember how your silliness has spoiled
everything."

"You oughtn't to speak to my mother like that," said the Princess. She
was eighteen, and it came to her suddenly and all in a moment that she
was a grown-up, so she spoke out.

The King could not utter a word for several minutes. He was too angry.
But the Queen said, "My dear child, don't interfere," quite crossly, for
she was frightened.

And to her husband she said, "My dear, why do you go on worrying about
it? Our daughter is not a boy, it is true--but she may marry a clever
man who could rule your kingdom after you, and learn as much magic as
ever you cared to teach him."

Then the King found his tongue.

"If she does marry," he said, slowly, "her husband will have to be a
very clever man--oh, yes, very clever indeed! And he will have to know a
very great deal more magic than I shall ever care to teach him."

The Queen knew at once by the King's tone that he was going to be
disagreeable.

"Ah," she said, "don't punish the child because she loves her mother."

"I'm not going to punish her for that," said he. "I'm only going to
teach her to respect her father."

And without another word he went off to his laboratory and worked all
night, boiling different-colored things in crucibles, and copying charms
in curious twisted letters from old brown books with mold stains on
their yellowy pages.

The next day his plan was all arranged. He took the poor Princess to the
Lone Tower, which stands on an island in the sea, a thousand miles from
everywhere. He gave her a dowry, and settled a handsome income on her.
He engaged a competent dragon to look after her, and also a respectable
griffin whose birth and upbringing he knew all about. And he said: "Here
you shall stay, my dear, respectful daughter, till the clever man comes
to marry you. He'll have to be clever enough to sail a ship through the
Nine Whirlpools that spin around the island, and to kill the dragon and
the griffin. Till he comes you'll never get any older or any wiser. No
doubt he will soon come. You can employ yourself in embroidering your
wedding gown. I wish you joy, my dutiful child."

And his carriage, drawn by live thunderbolts (thunder travels very
fast), rose in the air and disappeared, and the poor Princess was left,
with the dragon and the griffin, on the Island of the Nine Whirlpools.

The Queen, left at home, cried for a day and a night, and then she
remembered the witch and called to her. And the witch came, and the
Queen told her all.

"For the sake of the twice twenty-five kisses you gave me," said the
witch, "I will help you. But it is the last thing I can do, and it is
not much. Your daughter is under a spell, and I can take you to her.
But, if I do, you will have to be turned to stone, and to stay so till
the spell is taken off the child."

"I would be a stone for a thousand years," said the poor Queen, "if at
the end of them I could see my dear again."

So the witch took the Queen in a carriage drawn by live sunbeams (which
travel more quickly than anything else in the world, and much quicker
than thunder), and so away and away to the Lone Tower on the Island of
the Nine Whirlpools. And there was the Princess sitting on the floor in
the best room of the Lone Tower, crying as if her heart would break, and
the dragon and the griffin were sitting primly on each side of her.

"Oh, Mother, Mother, Mother," she cried, and hung around the Queen's
neck as if she would never let go.

"Now," said the witch, when they had all cried as much as was good for
them, "I can do one or two other little things for you. Time shall not
make the Princess sad. All days will be like one day till her deliverer
comes. And you and I, dear Queen, will sit in stone at the gate of the
tower. In doing this for you I lose all my witch's powers, and when I
say the spell that changes you to stone, I shall change with you, and if
ever we come out of the stone, I shall be a witch no more, but only a
happy old woman."

Then the three kissed one another again and again, and the witch said
the spell, and on each side of the door there was now a stone lady. One
of them had a stone crown on its head and a stone scepter in its hand;
but the other held a stone tablet with words on it, which the griffin
and the dragon could not read, though they had both had a very good
education.

And now all days seemed like one day to the Princess, and the next day
always seemed the day when her mother would come out of the stone and
kiss her again. And the years went slowly by. The wicked King died, and
some one else took his kingdom, and many things were changed in the
world; but the island did not change, nor the Nine Whirlpools, nor the
griffin, nor the dragon, nor the two stone ladies. And all the time,
from the very first, the day of the Princess's deliverance was coming,
creeping nearer, and nearer, and nearer. But no one saw it coming except
the Princess, and she only in dreams. And the years went by in tens and
in hundreds, and still the Nine Whirlpools spun around, roaring in
triumph the story of many a good ship that had gone down in their swirl,
bearing with it some Prince who had tried to win the Princess and her
dowry. And the great sea knew all the other stories of the Princes who
had come from very far, and had seen the whirlpools, and had shaken
their wise young heads and said: "'Bout ship!" and gone discreetly home
to their nice, safe, comfortable kingdoms.

But no one told the story of the deliverer who was to come. And the
years went by.

Now, after more scores of years than you would like to add up on your
slate, a certain sailor-boy sailed on the high seas with his uncle, who
was a skilled skipper. And the boy could reef a sail and coil a rope and
keep the ship's nose steady before the wind. And he was as good a boy as
you would find in a month of Sundays, and worthy to be a Prince.

Now there is Something which is wiser than all the world--and it knows
when people are worthy to be Princes. And this Something came from the
farther side of the seventh world, and whispered in the boy's ear.

And the boy heard, though he did not know he heard, and he looked out
over the black sea with the white foam-horses galloping over it, and far
away he saw a light. And he said to the skipper, his uncle: "What light
is that?"

Then the skipper said: "All good things defend you, Nigel, from sailing
near that light. It is not mentioned in all charts; but it is marked
in the old chart I steer by, which was my father's father's before me,
and his father's father's before him. It is the light that shines from
the Lone Tower that stands above the Nine Whirlpools. And when my
father's father was young he heard from the very old man, his
great-great-grandfather, that in that tower an enchanted Princess,
fairer than the day, waits to be delivered. But there is no deliverance,
so never steer that way; and think no more of the Princess, for that is
only an idle tale. But the whirlpools are quite real."

So, of course, from that day Nigel thought of nothing else. And as he
sailed hither and thither upon the high seas he saw from time to time
the light that shone out to sea across the wild swirl of the Nine
Whirlpools. And one night, when the ship was at anchor and the skipper
asleep in his bunk, Nigel launched the ship's boat and steered alone
over the dark sea towards the light. He dared not go very near till
daylight should show him what, indeed, were the whirlpools he had to
dread.

But when the dawn came he saw the Lone Tower standing dark against the
pink and primrose of the East, and about its base the sullen swirl of
black water, and he heard the wonderful roar of it. So he hung off and
on, all that day and for six days besides. And when he had watched seven
days he knew something. For you are certain to know something if you
give for seven days your whole thought to it, even though it be only the
first declension, or the nine-times table, or the dates of the Norman
Kings.

What he knew was this: that for five minutes out of the 1,440 minutes
that make up a day the whirlpools slipped into silence, while the tide
went down and left the yellow sand bare. And every day this happened,
but every day it was five minutes earlier than it had been the day
before. He made sure of this by the ship's chronometer, which he had
thoughtfully brought with him.

[Illustration: "The Lone Tower on the Island of the Nine Whirlpools."
_See page 88._]

So on the eighth day, at five minutes before noon, Nigel got ready. And
when the whirlpools suddenly stopped whirling and the tide sank, like
water in a basin that has a hole in it, he stuck to his oars and put
his back into his stroke, and presently beached the boat on the yellow
sand. Then he dragged it into a cave, and sat down to wait.

By five minutes and one second past noon, the whirlpools were black and
busy again, and Nigel peeped out of his cave. And on the rocky ledge
overhanging the sea he saw a Princess as beautiful as the day, with
golden hair and a green gown--and he went out to meet her.

"I've come to save you," he said. "How darling and beautiful you are!"

"You are very good, and very clever, and very dear," said the Princess,
smiling and giving him both her hands.

He shut a little kiss in each hand before he let them go.

"So now, when the tide is low again, I will take you away in my boat,"
he said.

"But what about the dragon and the griffin?" asked the Princess.

"Dear me," said Nigel. "I didn't know about them. I suppose I can kill
them?"

"Don't be a silly boy," said the Princess, pretending to be very grown
up, for, though she had been on the island time only knows how many
years, she was just eighteen, and she still liked pretending. "You
haven't a sword, or a shield, or anything!"

"Well, don't the beasts ever go to sleep?"

"Why, yes," said the Princess, "but only once in twenty-four hours, and
then the dragon is turned to stone. But the griffin has dreams. The
griffin sleeps at teatime every day, but the dragon sleeps every day for
five minutes, and every day it is three minutes later than it was the
day before."

"What time does he sleep today?" asked Nigel.

"At eleven," said the Princess.

"Ah," said Nigel, "can you do sums?"

"No," said the Princess sadly. "I was never good at them."

"Then I must," said Nigel. "I can, but it's slow work, and it makes me
very unhappy. It'll take me days and days."

"Don't begin yet," said the Princess. "You'll have plenty of time to be
unhappy when I'm not with you. Tell me all about yourself."

So he did. And then she told him all about herself.

"I know I've been here a long time," she said, "but I don't know what
Time is. And I am very busy sewing silk flowers on a golden gown for my
wedding day. And the griffin does the housework--his wings are so
convenient and feathery for sweeping and dusting. And the dragon does
the cooking--he's hot inside, so, of course, it's no trouble to him; and
though I don't know what Time is I'm sure it's time for my wedding day,
because my golden gown only wants one more white daisy on the sleeve,
and a lily on the bosom of it, and then it will be ready."

Just then they heard a dry, rustling clatter on the rocks above them and
a snorting sound. "It's the dragon," said the Princess hurriedly.
"Good-bye. Be a good boy, and get your sum done." And she ran away and
left him to his arithmetic.

Now, the sum was this: "If the whirlpools stop and the tide goes down
once in every twenty-four hours, and they do it five minutes earlier
every twenty-four hours, and if the dragon sleeps every day, and he does
it three minutes later every day, in how many days and at what time in
the day will the tide go down three minutes before the dragon falls
asleep?"

It is quite a simple sum, as you see: You could do it in a minute
because you have been to a good school and have taken pains with your
lessons; but it was quite otherwise with poor Nigel. He sat down to work
out his sum with a piece of chalk on a smooth stone. He tried it by
practice and the unitary method, by multiplication, and by
rule-of-three-and-three-quarters. He tried it by decimals and by
compound interest. He tried it by square root and by cube root. He tried
it by addition, simple and otherwise, and he tried it by mixed examples
in vulgar fractions. But it was all of no use. Then he tried to do the
sum by algebra, by simple and by quadratic equations, by trigonometry,
by logarithms, and by conic sections. But it would not do. He got an
answer every time, it is true, but it was always a different one, and he
could not feel sure which answer was right.

And just as he was feeling how much more important than anything else it
is to be able to do your sums, the Princess came back. And now it was
getting dark.

"Why, you've been seven hours over that sum," she said, "and you haven't
done it yet. Look here, this is what is written on the tablet of the
statue by the lower gate. It has figures in it. Perhaps it is the answer
to the sum."

She held out to him a big white magnolia leaf. And she had scratched on
it with the pin of her pearl brooch, and it had turned brown where she
had scratched it, as magnolia leaves will do. Nigel read:

        AFTER NINE DAYS
        T ii. 24.
        D ii. 27 Ans.
        P.S.--And the griffin is artificial. R.

He clapped his hands softly.

"Dear Princess," he said, "I know that's the right answer. It says R
too, you see. But I'll just prove it." So he hastily worked the sum
backward in decimals and equations and conic sections, and all the rules
he could think of. And it came right every time.

"So now we must wait," said he. And they waited.

And every day the Princess came to see Nigel and brought him food cooked
by the dragon, and he lived in his cave, and talked to her when she was
there, and thought about her when she was not, and they were both as
happy as the longest day in summer. Then at last came The Day. Nigel and
the Princess laid their plans.

"You're sure he won't hurt you, my only treasure?" said Nigel.

"Quite," said the Princess. "I only wish I were half as sure that he
wouldn't hurt you."

"My Princess," he said tenderly, "two great powers are on our side: the
power of Love and the power of Arithmetic. Those two are stronger than
anything else in the world."

So when the tide began to go down, Nigel and the Princess ran out on to
the sands, and there, in full sight of the terrace where the dragon kept
watch, Nigel took his Princess in his arms and kissed her. The griffin
was busy sweeping the stairs of the Lone Tower, but the dragon saw, and
he gave a cry of rage--and it was like twenty engines all letting off
steam at the top of their voices inside Cannon Street Station.

And the two lovers stood looking up at the dragon. He was dreadful to
look at. His head was white with age--and his beard had grown so long
that he caught his claws in it as he walked. His wings were white with
the salt that had settled on them from the spray of the sea. His tail
was long and thick and jointed and white, and had little legs to it, any
number of them--far too many--so that it looked like a very large fat
silkworm; and his claws were as long as lessons and as sharp as
bayonets.

"Good-bye, love!" cried Nigel, and ran out across the yellow sand toward
the sea. He had one end of a cord tied to his arm.

The dragon was clambering down the face of the cliff, and next moment he
was crawling and writhing and sprawling and wriggling across the beach
after Nigel, making great holes in the sand with his heavy feet--and the
very end of his tail, where there were no legs, made, as it dragged, a
mark in the sand such as you make when you launch a boat; and he
breathed fire till the wet sand hissed again, and the water of the
little rock pools got quite frightened, and all went off in steam.

Still Nigel held on and the dragon after him. The Princess could see
nothing for the steam, and she stood crying bitterly, but still holding
on tight with her right hand to the other end of the cord that Nigel had
told her to hold; while with her left she held the ship's chronometer,
and looked at it through her tears as he had bidden her look, so as to
know when to pull the rope.

On went Nigel over the sand, and on went the dragon after him. And the
tide was low, and sleepy little waves lapped the sand's edge.

Now at the lip of the water, Nigel paused and looked back, and the
dragon made a bound, beginning a scream of rage that was like all the
engines of all the railways in England. But it never uttered the second
half of that scream, for now it knew suddenly that it was sleepy--it
turned to hurry back to dry land, because sleeping near whirlpools is so
unsafe. But before it reached the shore sleep caught it and turned it to
stone. Nigel, seeing this, ran shoreward for his life--and the tide
began to flow in, and the time of the whirlpools' sleep was nearly over,
and he stumbled and he waded and he swam, and the Princess pulled for
dear life at the cord in her hand, and pulled him up on to the dry shelf
of rock just as the great sea dashed in and made itself once more into
the girdle of Nine Whirlpools all around the island.

But the dragon was asleep under the whirlpools, and when he woke up from
being asleep he found he was drowned, so there was an end of him.

"Now, there's only the griffin," said Nigel. And the Princess said:
"Yes--only--" And she kissed Nigel and went back to sew the last leaf of
the last lily on the bosom of her wedding gown. She thought and thought
of what was written on the stone about the griffin being artificial--and
next day she said to Nigel: "You know a griffin is half a lion and half
an eagle, and the other two halves when they've joined make the
leo-griff. But I've never seen him. Yet I have an idea."

So they talked it over and arranged everything.

When the griffin fell asleep that afternoon at teatime, Nigel went
softly behind him and trod on his tail, and at the same time the
Princess cried: "Look out! There's a lion behind you."

And the griffin, waking suddenly from his dreams, twisted his large
neck around to look for the lion, saw a lion's flank, and fastened its
eagle beak in it. For the griffin had been artificially made by the
King-enchanter, and the two halves had never really got used to each
other. So now the eagle half of the griffin, who was still rather
sleepy, believed that it was fighting a lion, and the lion part, being
half asleep, thought it was fighting an eagle, and the whole griffin in
its deep drowsiness hadn't the sense to pull itself together and
remember what it was made of. So the griffin rolled over and over, one
end of it fighting with the other, till the eagle end pecked the lion
end to death, and the lion end tore the eagle end with its claws till it
died. And so the griffin that was made of a lion and an eagle perished,
exactly as if it had been made of Kilkenny cats.

"Poor griffin," said the Princess, "it was very good at the housework. I
always liked it better than the dragon: It wasn't so hot-tempered."

At that moment there was a soft, silky rush behind the Princess, and
there was her mother, the Queen, who had slipped out of the stone statue
at the moment the griffin was dead, and now came hurrying to take her
dear daughter in her arms. The witch was clambering slowly off her
pedestal. She was a little stiff from standing still so long.

When they had all explained everything over and over to each other as
many times as was good for them, the witch said: "Well, but what about
the whirlpools?"

And Nigel said he didn't know. Then the witch said: "I'm not a witch
anymore. I'm only a happy old woman, but I know some things still. Those
whirlpools were made by the enchanter-King's dropping nine drops of his
blood into the sea. And his blood was so wicked that the sea has been
trying ever since to get rid of it, and that made the whirlpools. Now
you've only got to go out at low tide."

So Nigel understood and went out at low tide, and found in the sandy
hollow left by the first whirlpool a great red ruby. That was the first
drop of the wicked King's blood. The next day Nigel found another, and
next day another, and so on till the ninth day, and then the sea was as
smooth as glass.

The nine rubies were used afterwards in agriculture. You had only to
throw them out into a field if you wanted it plowed. Then the whole
surface of the land turned itself over in its anxiety to get rid of
something so wicked, and in the morning the field was found to be plowed
as thoroughly as any young man at Oxford. So the wicked King did some
good after all.

When the sea was smooth, ships came from far and wide, bringing people
to hear the wonderful story. And a beautiful palace was built, and the
Princess was married to Nigel in her gold dress, and they all lived
happily as long as was good for them.

The dragon still lies, a stone dragon on the sand, and at low tide the
little children play around him and over him. But the pieces that were
left of the griffin were buried under the herb-bed in the palace garden,
because it had been so good at housework, and it wasn't its fault that
it had been made so badly and put to such poor work as guarding a lady
from her lover.

I have no doubt that you will wish to know what the Princess lived on
during the long years when the dragon did the cooking. My dear, she
lived on her income--and that is a thing that a great many people would
like to be able to do.

THE DRAGON TAMERS]




VI. The Dragon Tamers


There was once an old, old castle--it was so old that its walls and
towers and turrets and gateways and arches had crumbled to ruins, and of
all its old splendor there were only two little rooms left; and it was
here that John the blacksmith had set up his forge. He was too poor to
live in a proper house, and no one asked any rent for the rooms in the
ruin, because all the lords of the castle were dead and gone this many a
year. So there John blew his bellows and hammered his iron and did all
the work which came his way. This was not much, because most of the
trade went to the mayor of the town, who was also a blacksmith in quite
a large way of business, and had his huge forge facing the square of the
town, and had twelve apprentices, all hammering like a nest of
woodpeckers, and twelve journeymen to order the apprentices about, and a
patent forge and a self-acting hammer and electric bellows, and all
things handsome about him. So of course the townspeople, whenever they
wanted a horse shod or a shaft mended, went to the mayor. John the
blacksmith struggled on as best he could, with a few odd jobs from
travelers and strangers who did not know what a superior forge the
mayor's was. The two rooms were warm and weather-tight, but not very
large; so the blacksmith got into the way of keeping his old iron, his
odds and ends, his fagots, and his twopence worth of coal in the great
dungeon down under the castle. It was a very fine dungeon indeed, with a
handsome vaulted roof and big iron rings whose staples were built into
the wall, very strong and convenient for tying captives to, and at one
end was a broken flight of wide steps leading down no one knew where.
Even the lords of the castle in the good old times had never known where
those steps led to, but every now and then they would kick a prisoner
down the steps in their lighthearted, hopeful way, and sure enough, the
prisoners never came back. The blacksmith had never dared to go beyond
the seventh step, and no more have I--so I know no more than he did what
was at the bottom of those stairs.

John the blacksmith had a wife and a little baby. When his wife was not
doing the housework she used to nurse the baby and cry, remembering the
happy days when she lived with her father, who kept seventeen cows and
lived quite in the country, and when John used to come courting her in
the summer evenings, as smart as smart, with a posy in his buttonhole.
And now John's hair was getting gray, and there was hardly ever enough
to eat.

As for the baby, it cried a good deal at odd times; but at night, when
its mother had settled down to sleep, it would always begin to cry,
quite as a matter of course, so that she hardly got any rest at all.
This made her very tired.

The baby could make up for its bad nights during the day if it liked,
but the poor mother couldn't. So whenever she had nothing to do she used
to sit and cry, because she was tired out with work and worry.

One evening the blacksmith was busy with his forge. He was making a
goat-shoe for the goat of a very rich lady, who wished to see how the
goat liked being shod, and also whether the shoe would come to fivepence
or sevenpence before she ordered the whole set. This was the only order
John had had that week. And as he worked his wife sat and nursed the
baby, who, for a wonder, was not crying.

Presently, over the noise of the bellows and over the clank of the iron,
there came another sound. The blacksmith and his wife looked at each
other.

"I heard nothing," said he.

"Neither did I," said she.

But the noise grew louder--and the two were so anxious not to hear it
that he hammered away at the goat-shoe harder than he had ever hammered
in his life, and she began to sing to the baby--a thing she had not had
the heart to do for weeks.

But through the blowing and hammering and singing the noise came louder
and louder, and the more they tried not to hear it, the more they had
to. It was like the noise of some great creature purring, purring,
purring--and the reason they did not want to believe they really heard
it was that it came from the great dungeon down below, where the old
iron was, and the firewood and the twopence worth of coal, and the
broken steps that went down into the dark and ended no one knew where.

"It can't be anything in the dungeon," said the blacksmith, wiping his
face. "Why, I shall have to go down there after more coals in a minute."

"There isn't anything there, of course. How could there be?" said his
wife. And they tried so hard to believe that there could be nothing
there that presently they very nearly did believe it.

Then the blacksmith took his shovel in one hand and his riveting hammer
in the other, and hung the old stable lantern on his little finger, and
went down to get the coals.

"I am not taking the hammer because I think there is something there,"
said he, "but it is handy for breaking the large lumps of coal."

"I quite understand," said his wife, who had brought the coal home in
her apron that very afternoon, and knew that it was all coal dust.

So he went down the winding stairs to the dungeon and stood at the
bottom of the steps, holding the lantern above his head just to see that
the dungeon really was empty, as usual. Half of it was empty as usual,
except for the old iron and odds and ends, and the firewood and the
coals. But the other side was not empty. It was quite full, and what it
was full of was Dragon.

"It must have come up those nasty broken steps from goodness knows
where," said the blacksmith to himself, trembling all over, as he tried
to creep back up the winding stairs.

But the dragon was too quick for him--it put out a great claw and caught
him by the leg, and as it moved it rattled like a great bunch of keys,
or like the sheet iron they make thunder out of in pantomimes.

"No you don't," said the dragon in a spluttering voice, like a damp
squib.

"Deary, deary me," said poor John, trembling more than ever in the claw
of the dragon. "Here's a nice end for a respectable blacksmith!"

The dragon seemed very much struck by this remark.

"Do you mind saying that again?" said he, quite politely.

So John said again, very distinctly:
"_Here_--_is_--_a_--_nice_--_end_--_for_--_a_--_respectable_--_blacksmith._"

"I didn't know," said the dragon. "Fancy now! You're the very man I
wanted."

"So I understood you to say before," said John, his teeth chattering.

"Oh, I don't mean what you mean," said the dragon, "but I should like
you to do a job for me. One of my wings has got some of the rivets out
of it just above the joint. Could you put that to rights?"

"I might, sir," said John, politely, for you must always be polite to a
possible customer, even if he be a dragon.

"A master craftsman--you are a master, of course?--can see in a minute
what's wrong," the dragon went on. "Just come around here and feel my
plates, will you?"

John timidly went around when the dragon took his claw away; and sure
enough, the dragon's wing was hanging loose, and several of the plates
near the joint certainly wanted riveting.

The dragon seemed to be made almost entirely of iron armor--a sort of
tawny, red-rust color it was; from damp, no doubt--and under it he
seemed to be covered with something furry.

All the blacksmith welled up in John's heart, and he felt more at ease.

"You could certainly do with a rivet or two, sir," said he. "In fact,
you want a good many."

"Well, get to work, then," said the dragon. "You mend my wing, and then
I'll go out and eat up all the town, and if you make a really smart job
of it I'll eat you last. There!"

"I don't want to be eaten last, sir," said John.

"Well then, I'll eat you first," said the dragon.

"I don't want that, sir, either," said John.

"Go on with you, you silly man," said the dragon, "you don't know your
own silly mind. Come, set to work."

"I don't like the job, sir," said John, "and that's the truth. I know
how easily accidents happen. It's all fair and smooth, and 'Please rivet
me, and I'll eat you last'--and then you get to work and you give a
gentleman a bit of a nip or a dig under his rivets--and then it's fire
and smoke, and no apologies will meet the case."

"Upon my word of honor as a dragon," said the other.

"I know you wouldn't do it on purpose, sir," said John, "but any
gentleman will give a jump and a sniff if he's nipped, and one of your
sniffs would be enough for me. Now, if you'd just let me fasten you up?"

"It would be so undignified," objected the dragon.

"We always fasten a horse up," said John, "and he's the 'noble animal.'"

"It's all very well," said the dragon, "but how do I know you'd untie me
again when you'd riveted me? Give me something in pledge. What do you
value most?"

"My hammer," said John. "A blacksmith is nothing without a hammer."

"But you'd want that for riveting me. You must think of something else,
and at once, or I'll eat you first."

At this moment the baby in the room above began to scream. Its mother
had been so quiet that it thought she had settled down for the night,
and that it was time to begin.

"Whatever's that?" said the dragon, starting so that every plate on his
body rattled.

"It's only the baby," said John.

"What's that?" asked the dragon. "Something you value?"

"Well, yes, sir, rather," said the blacksmith.

"Then bring it here," said the dragon, "and I'll take care of it till
you've done riveting me, and you shall tie me up."

"All right, sir," said John, "but I ought to warn you. Babies are poison
to dragons, so I don't deceive you. It's all right to touch--but don't
you go putting it into your mouth. I shouldn't like to see any harm come
to a nice-looking gentleman like you."

The dragon purred at this compliment and said: "All right, I'll be
careful. Now go and fetch the thing, whatever it is."

So John ran up the steps as quickly as he could, for he knew that if the
dragon got impatient before it was fastened, it could heave up the roof
of the dungeon with one heave of its back, and kill them all in the
ruins. His wife was asleep, in spite of the baby's cries; and John
picked up the baby and took it down and put it between the dragon's
front paws.

"You just purr to it, sir," he said, "and it'll be as good as gold."

So the dragon purred, and his purring pleased the baby so much that it
stopped crying.

Then John rummaged among the heap of old iron and found there some heavy
chains and a great collar that had been made in the days when men sang
over their work and put their hearts into it, so that the things they
made were strong enough to bear the weight of a thousand years, let
alone a dragon.

John fastened the dragon up with the collar and the chains, and when he
had padlocked them all on safely he set to work to find out how many
rivets would be needed.

"Six, eight, ten--twenty, forty," said he. "I haven't half enough rivets
in the shop. If you'll excuse me, sir, I'll step around to another forge
and get a few dozen. I won't be a minute."

[Illustration: "The dragon's purring pleased the baby." _See page
106._]

And off he went, leaving the baby between the dragon's fore-paws,
laughing and crowing with pleasure at the very large purr of it.

John ran as hard as he could into the town, and found the mayor and
corporation.

"There's a dragon in my dungeon," he said; "I've chained him up. Now
come and help to get my baby away."

And he told them all about it.

But they all happened to have engagements for that evening; so they
praised John's cleverness, and said they were quite content to leave the
matter in his hands.

"But what about my baby?" said John.

"Oh, well," said the mayor, "if anything should happen, you will always
be able to remember that your baby perished in a good cause."

So John went home again, and told his wife some of the tale.

"You've given the baby to the dragon!" she cried. "Oh, you unnatural
parent!"

"Hush," said John, and he told her some more. "Now," he said, "I'm going
down. After I've been down you can go, and if you keep your head the boy
will be all right."

So down went the blacksmith, and there was the dragon purring away with
all his might to keep the baby quiet.

"Hurry up, can't you?" he said. "I can't keep up this noise all night."

"I'm very sorry, sir," said the blacksmith, "but all the shops are shut.
The job must wait till the morning. And don't forget you've promised to
take care of that baby. You'll find it a little wearing, I'm afraid.
Good night, sir."

The dragon had purred till he was quite out of breath--so now he
stopped, and as soon as everything was quiet the baby thought everyone
must have settled for the night, and that it was time to begin to
scream. So it began.

"Oh, dear," said the dragon, "this is awful." He patted the baby with
his claw, but it screamed more than ever.

"And I am so tired too," said the dragon. "I did so hope I should have a
good night."

The baby went on screaming.

"There'll be no peace for me after this," said the dragon. "It's enough
to ruin one's nerves. Hush, then--did 'ums, then." And he tried to quiet
the baby as if it had been a young dragon. But when he began to sing
"Hush-a-by, Dragon," the baby screamed more and more and more. "I can't
keep it quiet," said the dragon; and then suddenly he saw a woman
sitting on the steps. "Here, I say," said he, "do you know anything
about babies?"

"I do, a little," said the mother.

"Then I wish you'd take this one, and let me get some sleep," said the
dragon, yawning. "You can bring it back in the morning before the
blacksmith comes."

So the mother picked up the baby and took it upstairs and told her
husband, and they went to bed happy, for they had caught the dragon and
saved the baby.

And next day John went down and explained carefully to the dragon
exactly how matters stood, and he got an iron gate with a grating to it
and set it up at the foot of the steps, and the dragon mewed furiously
for days and days, but when he found it was no good he was quiet.

So now John went to the mayor, and said: "I've got the dragon and I've
saved the town."

"Noble preserver," cried the mayor, "we will get up a subscription for
you, and crown you in public with a laurel wreath."

So the mayor put his name down for five pounds, and the corporation each
gave three, and other people gave their guineas and half guineas and
half crowns and crowns, and while the subscription was being made the
mayor ordered three poems at his own expense from the town poet to
celebrate the occasion. The poems were very much more admired,
especially by the mayor and corporation.

The first poem dealt with the noble conduct of the mayor in arranging to
have the dragon tied up. The second described the splendid assistance
rendered by the corporation. And the third expressed the pride and joy
of the poet in being permitted to sing such deeds, beside which the
actions of St. George must appear quite commonplace to all with a
feeling heart or a well-balanced brain.

When the subscription was finished there was a thousand pounds, and a
committee was formed to settle what should be done with it. A third of
it went to pay for a banquet to the mayor and corporation; another third
was spent in buying a gold collar with a dragon on it for the mayor and
gold medals with dragons on them for the corporation; and what was left
went in committee expenses.

So there was nothing for the blacksmith except the laurel wreath and the
knowledge that it really was he who had saved the town. But after this
things went a little better with the blacksmith. To begin with, the baby
did not cry so much as it had before. Then the rich lady who owned the
goat was so touched by John's noble action that she ordered a complete
set of shoes at 2 shillings, 4 pence, and even made it up to 2
shillings, 6 pence, in grateful recognition of his public-spirited
conduct. Then tourists used to come in breaks from quite a long way off,
and pay twopence each to go down the steps and peep through the iron
grating at the rusty dragon in the dungeon--and it was threepence extra
for each party if the blacksmith let off colored fire to see it by,
which, as the fire was extremely short, was twopence-halfpenny clear
profit every time. And the blacksmith's wife used to provide teas at
ninepence a head, and altogether things grew brighter week by week.

The baby--named John, after his father, and called Johnnie for
short--began presently to grow up. He was great friends with Tina, the
daughter of the whitesmith, who lived nearly opposite. She was a dear
little girl with yellow pigtails and blue eyes, and she was tired of
hearing the story of how Johnnie, when he was a baby, had been minded by
a real dragon.

The two children used to go together to peep through the iron grating at
the dragon, and sometimes they would hear him mew piteously. And they
would light a halfpenny's worth of colored fire to look at him by. And
they grew older and wiser.

At last one day the mayor and corporation, hunting the hare in their
gold gowns, came screaming back to the town gates with the news that a
lame, humpy giant, as big as a tin church, was coming over the marshes
toward the town.

"We're lost," said the mayor. "I'd give a thousand pounds to anyone who
could keep that giant out of the town. I know what he eats--by his
teeth."

No one seemed to know what to do. But Johnnie and Tina were listening,
and they looked at each other, and ran off as fast as their boots would
carry them.

They ran through the forge, and down the dungeon steps, and knocked at
the iron door. "Who's there?" said the dragon. "It's only us," said the
children.

And the dragon was so dull from having been alone for ten years that he
said: "Come in, dears."

"You won't hurt us, or breathe fire at us or anything?" asked Tina.

And the dragon said, "Not for worlds."

So they went in and talked to him, and told him what the weather was
like outside, and what there was in the papers, and at last Johnnie
said: "There's a lame giant in the town. He wants you."

"Does he?" said the dragon, showing his teeth. "If only I were out of
this!"

"If we let you loose you might manage to run away before he could catch
you."

"Yes, I might," answered the dragon, "but then again I mightn't."

"Why--you'd never fight him?" said Tina.

"No," said the dragon; "I'm all for peace, I am. You let me out, and
you'll see."

So the children loosed the dragon from the chains and the collar, and
he broke down one end of the dungeon and went out--only pausing at the
forge door to get the blacksmith to rivet his wing.

He met the lame giant at the gate of the town, and the giant banged on
the dragon with his club as if he were banging an iron foundry, and the
dragon behaved like a smelting works--all fire and smoke. It was a
fearful sight, and people watched it from a distance, falling off their
legs with the shock of every bang, but always getting up to look again.

At last the dragon won, and the giant sneaked away across the marshes,
and the dragon, who was very tired, went home to sleep, announcing his
intention of eating the town in the morning. He went back into his old
dungeon because he was a stranger in the town, and he did not know of
any other respectable lodging. Then Tina and Johnnie went to the mayor
and corporation and said, "The giant is settled. Please give us the
thousand pounds reward."

But the mayor said: "No, no, my boy. It is not you who have settled the
giant, it is the dragon. I suppose you have chained him up again? When
he comes to claim the reward he shall have it."

"He isn't chained up yet," said Johnnie. "Shall I send him to claim the
reward?"

But the mayor said he need not trouble; and now he offered a thousand
pounds to anyone who would get the dragon chained up again.

"I don't trust you," said Johnnie. "Look how you treated my father when
he chained up the dragon."

But the people who were listening at the door interrupted, and said that
if Johnnie could fasten up the dragon again they would turn out the
mayor and let Johnnie be mayor in his place. For they had been
dissatisfied with the mayor for some time, and thought they would like a
change.

So Johnnie said, "Done," and off he went, hand in hand with Tina, and
they called on all their little friends and said: "Will you help us to
save the town?"

And all the children said: "Yes, of course we will. What fun!"

"Well, then," said Tina, "you must all bring your basins of bread and
milk to the forge tomorrow at breakfast time."

"And if ever I am mayor," said Johnnie, "I will give a banquet, and you
shall be invited. And we'll have nothing but sweet things from beginning
to end."

All the children promised, and next morning Tina and Johnnie rolled
their big washing tub down the winding stair.

"What's that noise?" asked the dragon.

"It's only a big giant breathing," said Tina, "He's gone by now."

Then, when all the town children brought their bread and milk, Tina
emptied it into the wash tub, and when the tub was full Tina knocked at
the iron door with the grating in it and said: "May we come in?"

"Oh, yes," said the dragon, "it's very dull here."

So they went in, and with the help of nine other children they lifted
the washing tub in and set it down by the dragon. Then all the other
children went away, and Tina and Johnnie sat down and cried.

"What's this?" asked the dragon. "And what's the matter?"

"This is bread and milk," said Johnnie; "it's our breakfast--all of it."

"Well," said the dragon, "I don't see what you want with breakfast. I'm
going to eat everyone in the town as soon as I've rested a little."

"Dear Mr. Dragon," said Tina, "I wish you wouldn't eat us. How would you
like to be eaten yourself?"

"Not at all," the dragon confessed, "but nobody will eat me."

"I don't know," said Johnnie, "there's a giant--"

"I know. I fought with him, and licked him."

"Yes, but there's another come now--the one you fought was only this
one's little boy. This one is half as big again."

"He's seven times as big," said Tina.

"No, nine times," said Johnnie. "He's bigger than the steeple."

"Oh, dear," said the dragon. "I never expected this."

"And the mayor has told him where you are," Tina went on, "and he is
coming to eat you as soon as he has sharpened his big knife. The mayor
told him you were a wild dragon--but he didn't mind. He said he only ate
wild dragons--with bread sauce."

"That's tiresome," said the dragon. "And I suppose this sloppy stuff in
the tub is the bread sauce?"

The children said it was. "Of course," they added, "bread sauce is only
served with wild dragons. Tame ones are served with apple sauce and
onion stuffing. What a pity you're not a tame one: He'd never look at
you then," they said. "Good-bye, poor dragon, we shall never see you
again, and now you'll know what it's like to be eaten." And they began
to cry again.

"Well, but look here," said the dragon, "couldn't you pretend I was a
tame dragon? Tell the giant that I'm just a poor little timid tame
dragon that you kept for a pet."

"He'd never believe it," said Johnnie. "If you were our tame dragon we
should keep you tied up, you know. We shouldn't like to risk losing such
a dear, pretty pet."

Then the dragon begged them to fasten him up at once, and they did so:
with the collar and chains that were made years ago--in the days when
men sang over their work and made it strong enough to bear any strain.

And then they went away and told the people what they had done, and
Johnnie was made mayor, and had a glorious feast exactly as he had said
he would--with nothing in it but sweet things. It began with Turkish
delight and halfpenny buns, and went on with oranges, toffee, coconut
ice, peppermints, jam puffs, raspberry-noyeau, ice creams, and
meringues, and ended with bull's-eyes and gingerbread and acid drops.

This was all very well for Johnnie and Tina; but if you are kind
children with feeling hearts you will perhaps feel sorry for the poor
deceived, deluded dragon--chained up in the dull dungeon, with nothing
to do but to think over the shocking untruths that Johnnie had told him.

When he thought how he had been tricked, the poor captive dragon began
to weep--and the large tears fell down over his rusty plates. And
presently he began to feel faint, as people sometimes do when they have
been crying, especially if they have not had anything to eat for ten
years or so.

And then the poor creature dried his eyes and looked about him, and
there he saw the tub of bread and milk. So he thought, "If giants like
this damp, white stuff, perhaps I should like it too," and he tasted a
little, and liked it so much that he ate it all up.

And the next time the tourists came, and Johnnie let off the colored
fire, the dragon said shyly: "Excuse my troubling you, but could you
bring me a little more bread and milk?"

So Johnnie arranged that people should go around with carts every day to
collect the children's bread and milk for the dragon. The children were
fed at the town's expense--on whatever they liked; and they ate nothing
but cake and buns and sweet things, and they said the poor dragon was
very welcome to their bread and milk.

Now, when Johnnie had been mayor ten years or so he married Tina, and on
their wedding morning they went to see the dragon. He had grown quite
tame, and his rusty plates had fallen off in places, and underneath he
was soft and furry to stroke. So now they stroked him.

And he said, "I don't know how I could ever have liked eating anything
but bread and milk. I _am_ a tame dragon now, aren't I?" And when they
said that yes, he was, the dragon said: "I am so tame, won't you undo
me?" And some people would have been afraid to trust him, but Johnnie
and Tina were so happy on their wedding day that they could not believe
any harm of anyone in the world. So they loosened the chains, and the
dragon said: "Excuse me a moment, there are one or two little things I
should like to fetch," and he moved off to those mysterious steps and
went down them, out of sight into the darkness. And as he moved, more
and more of his rusty plates fell off.

In a few minutes they heard him clanking up the steps. He brought
something in his mouth--it was a bag of gold.

"It's no good to me," he said. "Perhaps you might find it useful." So
they thanked him very kindly.

"More where that came from," said he, and fetched more and more and
more, till they told him to stop. So now they were rich, and so were
their fathers and mothers. Indeed, everyone was rich, and there were no
more poor people in the town. And they all got rich without working,
which is very wrong; but the dragon had never been to school, as you
have, so he knew no better.

And as the dragon came out of the dungeon, following Johnnie and Tina
into the bright gold and blue of their wedding day, he blinked his eyes
as a cat does in the sunshine, and he shook himself, and the last of his
plates dropped off, and his wings with them, and he was just like a
very, very extra-sized cat. And from that day he grew furrier and
furrier, and he was the beginning of all cats. Nothing of the dragon
remained except the claws, which all cats have still, as you can easily
ascertain.

And I hope you see now how important it is to feed your cat with bread
and milk. If you were to let it have nothing to eat but mice and birds
it might grow larger and fiercer, and scalier and tailier, and get wings
and turn into the beginning of dragons. And then there would be all the
bother over again.

THE FIERY DRAGON]




VII. The Fiery Dragon,

or The Heart of Stone and the Heart of Gold


The little white Princess always woke in her little white bed when the
starlings began to chatter in the pearl gray morning. As soon as the
woods were awake, she used to run up the twisting turret-stairs with her
little bare feet, and stand on the top of the tower in her white
bed-gown, and kiss her hands to the sun and to the woods and to the
sleeping town, and say: "Good morning, pretty world!"

Then she would run down the cold stone steps and dress herself in her
short skirt and her cap and apron, and begin the day's work. She swept
the rooms and made the breakfast, she washed the dishes and she scoured
the pans, and all this she did because she was a real Princess. For of
all who should have served her, only one remained faithful--her old
nurse, who had lived with her in the tower all the Princess's life. And,
now the nurse was old and feeble, the Princess would not let her work
any more, but did all the housework herself, while Nurse sat still and
did the sewing, because this was a real Princess with skin like milk and
hair like flax and a heart like gold.

Her name was Sabrinetta, and her grandmother was Sabra, who married St.
George after he had killed the dragon, and by real rights all the
country belonged to her: the woods that stretched away to the mountains,
the downs that sloped down to the sea, the pretty fields of corn and
maize and rye, the olive orchards and the vineyards, and the little town
itself--with its towers and its turrets, its steep roofs and strange
windows--that nestled in the hollow between the sea, where the whirlpool
was, and the mountains, white with snow and rosy with sunrise.

But when her father and mother had died, leaving her cousin to take care
of the kingdom till she grew up, he, being a very evil Prince, took
everything away from her, and all the people followed him, and now
nothing was left her of all her possessions except the great dragon
proof tower that her grandfather, St. George, had built, and of all who
should have been her servants only the good nurse.

This was why Sabrinetta was the first person in all the land to get a
glimpse of the wonder.

Early, early, early, while all the townspeople were fast asleep, she ran
up the turret-steps and looked out over the field, and at the other side
of the field there was a green, ferny ditch and a rose-thorny hedge, and
then came the wood. And as Sabrinetta stood on her tower she saw a
shaking and a twisting of the rose-thorny hedge, and then something very
bright and shining wriggled out through it into the ferny ditch and back
again. It only came out for a minute, but she saw it quite plainly, and
she said to herself: "Dear me, what a curious, shiny, bright-looking
creature! If it were bigger, and if I didn't know that there have been
no fabulous monsters for quite a long time now, I should almost think it
was a dragon."

The thing, whatever it was, did look rather like a dragon--but then it
was too small; and it looked rather like a lizard--only then it was too
big. It was about as long as a hearthrug.

"I wish it had not been in such a hurry to get back into the wood," said
Sabrinetta. "Of course, it's quite safe for me, in my dragonproof tower;
but if it is a dragon, it's quite big enough to eat people, and today's
the first of May, and the children go out to get flowers in the wood."

When Sabrinetta had done the housework (she did not leave so much as a
speck of dust anywhere, even in the corneriest corner of the winding
stair) she put on her milk white, silky gown with the moon-daisies
worked on it, and went up to the top of her tower again.

Across the fields troops of children were going out to gather the may,
and the sound of their laughter and singing came up to the top of the
tower.

"I do hope it wasn't a dragon," said Sabrinetta.

The children went by twos and by threes and by tens and by twenties, and
the red and blue and yellow and white of their frocks were scattered on
the green of the field.

"It's like a green silk mantle worked with flowers," said the Princess,
smiling.

Then by twos and by threes, by tens and by twenties, the children
vanished into the wood, till the mantle of the field was left plain
green once more.

"All the embroidery is unpicked," said the Princess, sighing.

The sun shone, and the sky was blue, and the fields were quite green,
and all the flowers were very bright indeed, because it was May Day.

Then quite suddenly a cloud passed over the sun, and the silence was
broken by shrieks from far off; and, like a many-colored torrent, all
the children burst from the wood and rushed, a red and blue and yellow
and white wave, across the field, screaming as they ran. Their voices
came up to the Princess on her tower, and she heard the words threaded
on their screams like beads on sharp needles: "The dragon, the dragon,
the dragon! Open the gates! The dragon is coming! The fiery dragon!"

And they swept across the field and into the gate of the town, and the
Princess heard the gate bang, and the children were out of sight--but on
the other side of the field the rose-thorns crackled and smashed in the
hedge, and something very large and glaring and horrible trampled the
ferns in the ditch for one moment before it hid itself again in the
covert of the wood.

The Princess went down and told her nurse, and the nurse at once locked
the great door of the tower and put the key in her pocket.

"Let them take care of themselves," she said, when the Princess begged
to be allowed to go out and help to take care of the children. "My
business is to take care of you, my precious, and I'm going to do it.
Old as I am, I can turn a key still."

So Sabrinetta went up again to the top of her tower, and cried whenever
she thought of the children and the fiery dragon. For she knew, of
course, that the gates of the town were not dragonproof, and that the
dragon could just walk in whenever he liked.

The children ran straight to the palace, where the Prince was cracking
his hunting whip down at the kennels, and told him what had happened.

"Good sport," said the Prince, and he ordered out his pack of
hippopotamuses at once. It was his custom to hunt big game with
hippopotamuses, and people would not have minded that so much--but he
would swagger about in the streets of the town with his pack yelping and
gamboling at his heels, and when he did that, the green-grocer, who had
his stall in the marketplace, always regretted it; and the crockery
merchant, who spread his wares on the pavement, was ruined for life
every time the Prince chose to show off his pack.

The Prince rode out of the town with his hippopotamuses trotting and
frisking behind him, and people got inside their houses as quickly as
they could when they heard the voices of his pack and the blowing of his
horn. The pack squeezed through the town gates and off across country to
hunt the dragon. Few of you who had not seen a pack of hippopotamuses in
full cry will be able to imagine at all what the hunt was like. To begin
with, hippopotamuses do not bay like hounds: They grunt like pigs, and
their grunt is very big and fierce. Then, of course, no one expects
hippopotamuses to jump. They just crash through the hedges and lumber
through the standing corn, doing serious injury to the crops, and
annoying the farmers very much. All the hippopotamuses had collars with
their name and address on, but when the farmers called at the palace to
complain of the injury to their standing crops, the Prince always said
it served them right for leaving their crops standing about in people's
way, and he never paid anything at all.

So now, when he and his pack went out, several people in the town
whispered, "I wish the dragon would eat him"--which was very wrong of
them, no doubt, but then he was such a very nasty Prince.

They hunted by field, and they hunted by wold; they drew the woods
blank, and the scent didn't lie on the downs at all. The dragon was shy,
and would not show himself.

But just as the Prince was beginning to think there was no dragon at
all, but only a cock and bull, his favourite old hippopotamus gave
tongue. The Prince blew his horn and shouted: "Tally ho! Hark forward!
Tantivy!" and the whole pack charged downhill toward the hollow by the
wood. For there, plain to be seen, was the dragon, as big as a barge,
glowing like a furnace, and spitting fire and showing his shining teeth.

"The hunt is up!" cried the Prince. And indeed it was. For the
dragon--instead of behaving as a quarry should, and running away--ran
straight at the pack, and the Prince, on his elephant, had the
mortification of seeing his prize pack swallowed up one by one in the
twinkling of an eye, by the dragon they had come out to hunt. The dragon
swallowed all the hippopotamuses just as a dog swallows bits of meat. It
was a shocking sight. Of the whole of the pack that had come out
sporting so merrily to the music of the horn, now not even a
puppy-hippopotamus was left, and the dragon was looking anxiously around
to see if he had forgotten anything.

The Prince slipped off his elephant on the other side and ran into the
thickest part of the wood. He hoped the dragon could not break through
the bushes there, since they were very strong and close. He went
crawling on hands and knees in a most un-Prince-like way, and at last,
finding a hollow tree, he crept into it. The wood was very still--no
crashing of branches and no smell of burning came to alarm the Prince.
He drained the silver hunting bottle slung from his shoulder, and
stretched his legs in the hollow tree. He never shed a single tear for
his poor tame hippopotamuses who had eaten from his hand and followed
him faithfully in all the pleasures of the chase for so many years. For
he was a false Prince, with a skin like leather and hair like hearth
brushes and a heart like a stone. He never shed a tear, but he just went
to sleep.

When he awoke it was dark. He crept out of the tree and rubbed his eyes.
The wood was black about him, but there was a red glow in a dell close
by. It was a fire of sticks, and beside it sat a ragged youth with long,
yellow hair; all around lay sleeping forms which breathed heavily.

"Who are you?" said the Prince.

"I'm Elfin, the pig keeper," said the ragged youth. "And who are you?"

"I'm Tiresome, the Prince," said the other.

"And what are you doing out of your palace at this time of night?" asked
the pig keeper, severely.

"I've been hunting," said the Prince.

The pig keeper laughed. "Oh, it was you I saw, then? A good hunt, wasn't
it? My pigs and I were looking on."

All the sleeping forms grunted and snored, and the Prince saw that they
were pigs: He knew it by their manners.

"If you had known as much as I do," Elfin went on, "you might have saved
your pack."

"What do you mean?" said Tiresome.

"Why, the dragon," said Elfin. "You went out at the wrong time of day.
The dragon should be hunted at night."

"No, thank you," said the Prince, with a shudder. "A daylight hunt is
quite good enough for me, you silly pig keeper."

"Oh, well," said Elfin, "do as you like about it--the dragon will come
and hunt you tomorrow, as likely as not. I don't care if he does, you
silly Prince."

"You're very rude," said Tiresome.

"Oh, no, only truthful," said Elfin.

"Well, tell me the truth, then. What is it that, if I had known as much
as you do about, I shouldn't have lost my hippopotamuses?"

"You don't speak very good English," said Elfin. "But come, what will
you give me if I tell you?"

"If you tell me what?" said the tiresome Prince.

"What you want to know."

"I don't want to know anything," said Prince Tiresome.

"Then you're more of a silly even than I thought," said Elfin. "Don't
you want to know how to settle the dragon before he settles you?"

"It might be as well," the Prince admitted.

"Well, I haven't much patience at any time," said Elfin, "and now I can
assure you that there's very little left. What will you give me if I
tell you?"

"Half my kingdom," said the Prince, "and my cousin's hand in marriage."

"Done," said the pig keeper. "Here goes! The dragon grows small at
night! He sleeps under the root of this tree. I use him to light my fire
with."

And, sure enough, there under the tree was the dragon on a nest of
scorched moss, and he was about as long as your finger.

"How can I kill him?" asked the Prince.

"I don't know that you can kill him," said Elfin, "but you can take him
away if you've brought anything to put him in. That bottle of yours
would do."

So between them they managed, with bits of stick and by singeing their
fingers a little, to poke and shove the dragon till they made it creep
into the silver hunting bottle, and then the Prince screwed on the top
tight.

"Now we've got him," said Elfin. "Let's take him home and put Solomon's
seal on the mouth of the bottle, and then he'll be safe enough. Come
along--we'll divide up the kingdom tomorrow, and then I shall have some
money to buy fine clothes to go courting in."

But when the wicked Prince made promises he did not make them to keep.

"Go on with you! What do you mean?" he said. "I found the dragon and
I've imprisoned him. I never said a word about courtings or kingdoms. If
you say I did, I shall cut your head off at once." And he drew his
sword.

"All right," said Elfin, shrugging his shoulders. "I'm better off than
you are, anyhow."

"What do you mean?" spluttered the Prince.

"Why, you've only got a kingdom (and a dragon), but I've got clean hands
(and five and seventy fine black pigs)."

So Elfin sat down again by his fire, and the Prince went home and told
his Parliament how clever and brave he had been, and though he woke them
up on purpose to tell them, they were not angry, but said: "You are
indeed brave and clever." For they knew what happened to people with
whom the Prince was not pleased.

Then the Prime Minister solemnly put Solomon's seal on the mouth of the
bottle, and the bottle was put in the Treasury, which was the strongest
building in the town, and was made of solid copper, with walls as thick
as Waterloo Bridge.

The bottle was set down among the sacks of gold, and the junior
secretary to the junior clerk of the last Lord of the Treasury was
appointed to sit up all night with it and see if anything happened. The
junior secretary had never seen a dragon, and, what was more, he did not
believe the Prince had ever seen a dragon either. The Prince had never
been a really truthful boy, and it would have been just like him to
bring home a bottle with nothing in it and then to pretend that there
was a dragon inside. So the junior secretary did not at all mind being
left. They gave him the key, and when everyone in the town had gone back
to bed he let in some of the junior secretaries from other Government
departments, and they had a jolly game of hide-and-seek among the sacks
of gold, and played marbles with the diamonds and rubies and pearls in
the big ivory chests.

They enjoyed themselves very much, but by-and-by the copper treasury
began to get warmer and warmer, and suddenly the junior secretary cried
out, "Look at the bottle!"

The bottle sealed with Solomon's seal had swollen to three times its
proper size and seemed to be nearly red hot, and the air got warmer and
warmer and the bottle bigger and bigger, till all the junior secretaries
agreed that the place was too hot to hold them, and out they went,
tumbling over each other in their haste, and just as the last got out
and locked the door the bottle burst, and out came the dragon, very
fiery, and swelling more and more every minute, and he began to eat the
sacks of gold and crunch up the pearls and diamonds and rubies as if
they were sugar.

By breakfasttime he had devoured the whole of the Prince's treasures,
and when the Prince came along the street at about eleven, he met the
dragon coming out of the broken door of the Treasury, with molten gold
still dripping from his jaws. Then the Prince turned and ran for his
life, and as he ran toward the dragonproof tower the little white
Princess saw him coming, and she ran down and unlocked the door and let
him in, and slammed the dragonproof door in the fiery face of the
dragon, who sat down and whined outside, because he wanted the Prince
very much indeed.

The Princess took Prince Tiresome into the best room, and laid the
cloth, and gave him cream and eggs and white grapes and honey and bread,
with many other things, yellow and white and good to eat, and she served
him just as kindly as she would have done if he had been anyone else
instead of the bad Prince who had taken away her kingdom and kept it for
himself--because she was a true Princess and had a heart of gold.

When he had eaten and drunk, he begged the Princess to show him how to
lock and unlock the door. The nurse was asleep, so there was no one to
tell the Princess not to, and she did.

[Illustration: "The junior secretary cried out, 'Look at the bottle!'"
_See page 129._]

"You turn the key like this," she said, "and the door keeps shut. But
turn it nine times around the wrong way, and the door flies open."

And so it did. And the moment it opened, the Prince pushed the white
Princess out of her tower, just as he had pushed her out of her kingdom,
and shut the door. For he wanted to have the tower all for himself. And
there she was, in the street, and on the other side of the way the
dragon was sitting whining, but he did not try to eat her,
because--though the old nurse did not know it--dragons cannot eat white
Princesses with hearts of gold.

The Princess could not walk through the streets of the town in her
milky-silky gown with the daisies on it, and with no hat and no gloves,
so she turned the other way, and ran out across the meadows, toward the
wood. She had never been out of her tower before, and the soft grass
under her feet felt like grass of Paradise.

She ran right into the thickest part of the wood, because she did not
know what her heart was made of, and she was afraid of the dragon, and
there in a dell she came on Elfin and his five and seventy fine pigs. He
was playing his flute, and around him the pigs were dancing cheerfully
on their hind legs.

"Oh, dear," said the Princess, "do take care of me. I am so frightened."

"I will," said Elfin, putting his arms around her. "Now you are quite
safe. What were you frightened of?"

"The dragon," she said.

"So it's gotten out of the silver bottle," said Elfin. "I hope it's
eaten the Prince."

"No," said Sabrinetta. "But why?"

He told her of the mean trick that the Prince had played on him.

"And he promised me half his kingdom and the hand of his cousin the
Princess," said Elfin.

"Oh, dear, what a shame!" said Sabrinetta, trying to get out of his
arms. "How dare he?"

"What's the matter?" he asked, holding her tighter. "It _was_ a shame,
or at least _I_ thought so. But now he may keep his kingdom, half and
whole, if I may keep what I have."

"What's that?" asked the Princess.

"Why, you--my pretty, my dear," said Elfin, "and as for the Princess,
his cousin--forgive me, dearest heart, but when I asked for her I hadn't
seen the real Princess, the _only_ Princess, _my_ Princess."

"Do you mean me?" said Sabrinetta.

"Who else?" he asked.

"Yes, but five minutes ago you hadn't seen me!"

"Five minutes ago I was a pig keeper--now I've held you in my arms I'm a
Prince, though I should have to keep pigs to the end of my days."

"But you haven't asked _me_," said the Princess.

"You asked me to take care of you," said Elfin, "and I will--all my life
long."

So that was settled, and they began to talk of really important things,
such as the dragon and the Prince, and all the time Elfin did not know
that this was the Princess, but he knew that she had a heart of gold,
and he told her so, many times.

"The mistake," said Elfin, "was in not having a dragonproof bottle. I
see that now."

"Oh, is that all?" said the Princess. "I can easily get you one of
those--because everything in my tower is dragonproof. We ought to do
something to settle the dragon and save the little children."

So she started off to get the bottle, but she would not let Elfin come
with her.

"If what you say is true," she said, "if you are sure that I have a
heart of gold, the dragon won't hurt me, and somebody must stay with the
pigs."

Elfin was quite sure, so he let her go.

She found the door of her tower open. The dragon had waited patiently
for the Prince, and the moment he opened the door and came out--though
he was only out for an instant to post a letter to his Prime Minister
saying where he was and asking them to send the fire brigade to deal
with the fiery dragon--the dragon ate him. Then the dragon went back to
the wood, because it was getting near his time to grow small for the
night.

So Sabrinetta went in and kissed her nurse and made her a cup of tea and
explained what was going to happen, and that she had a heart of gold, so
the dragon couldn't eat her; and the nurse saw that of course the
Princess was quite safe, and kissed her and let her go.

She took the dragonproof bottle, made of burnished brass, and ran back
to the wood, and to the dell, where Elfin was sitting among his sleek
black pigs, waiting for her.

"I thought you were never coming back," he said. "You have been away a
year, at least."

The Princess sat down beside him among the pigs, and they held each
other's hands till it was dark, and then the dragon came crawling over
the moss, scorching it as he came, and getting smaller as he crawled,
and curled up under the root of the tree.

"Now then," said Elfin, "you hold the bottle." Then he poked and prodded
the dragon with bits of stick till it crawled into the dragonproof
bottle. But there was no stopper.

"Never mind," said Elfin. "I'll put my finger in for a stopper."

"No, let me," said the Princess. But of course Elfin would not let her.
He stuffed his finger into the top of the bottle, and the Princess cried
out: "The sea--the sea--run for the cliffs!" And off they went, with the
five and seventy pigs trotting steadily after them in a long black
procession.

The bottle got hotter and hotter in Elfin's hands, because the dragon
inside was puffing fire and smoke with all his might--hotter and hotter
and hotter--but Elfin held on till they came to the cliff edge, and
there was the dark blue sea, and the whirlpool going around and around.

Elfin lifted the bottle high above his head and hurled it out between
the stars and the sea, and it fell in the middle of the whirlpool.

"We've saved the country," said the Princess. "You've saved the little
children. Give me your hands."

"I can't," said Elfin. "I shall never be able to take your dear hands
again. My hands are burnt off."

And so they were: There were only black cinders where his hands ought to
have been. The Princess kissed them, and cried over them, and tore
pieces of her silky-milky gown to tie them up with, and the two went
back to the tower and told the nurse all about everything. And the pigs
sat outside and waited.

"He is the bravest man in the world," said Sabrinetta. "He has saved the
country and the little children; but, oh, his hands--his poor, dear,
darling hands!"

Here the door of the room opened, and the oldest of the five and seventy
pigs came in. It went up to Elfin and rubbed itself against him with
little loving grunts.

"See the dear creature," said the nurse, wiping away a tear. "It knows,
it knows!"

Sabrinetta stroked the pig, because Elfin had no hands for stroking or
for anything else.

"The only cure for a dragon burn," said the old nurse, "is pig's fat,
and well that faithful creature knows it----"

"I wouldn't for a kingdom," cried Elfin, stroking the pig as best he
could with his elbow.

"Is there no other cure?" asked the Princess.

Here another pig put its black nose in at the door, and then another and
another, till the room was full of pigs, a surging mass of rounded
blackness, pushing and struggling to get at Elfin, and grunting softly
in the language of true affection.

"There is one other," said the nurse. "The dear, affectionate
beasts--they all want to die for you."

"What is the other cure?" said Sabrinetta anxiously.

"If a man is burnt by a dragon," said the nurse, "and a certain number
of people are willing to die for him, it is enough if each should kiss
the burn and wish it well in the depths of his loving heart."

"The number! The number!" cried Sabrinetta.

"Seventy-seven," said the nurse.

"We have only seventy-five pigs," said the Princess, "and with me that's
seventy-six!"

"It must be seventy-seven--and I really can't die for him, so nothing
can be done," said the nurse, sadly. "He must have cork hands."

"I knew about the seventy-seven loving people," said Elfin. "But I never
thought my dear pigs loved me so much as all this, and my dear too--and,
of course, that only makes it more impossible. There's one other charm
that cures dragon burns, though; but I'd rather be burnt black all over
than marry anyone but you, my dear, my pretty."

"Why, who must you marry to cure your dragon burns?" asked Sabrinetta.

"A Princess. That's how St. George cured his burns."

"There now! Think of that!" said the nurse. "And I never heard tell of
that cure, old as I am."

But Sabrinetta threw her arms round Elfin's neck, and held him as though
she would never let him go.

"Then it's all right, my dear, brave, precious Elfin," she cried, "for I
am a Princess, and you shall be my Prince. Come along, Nurse--don't wait
to put on your bonnet. We'll go and be married this very moment."

So they went, and the pigs came after, moving in stately blackness, two
by two. And, the minute he was married to the Princess, Elfin's hands
got quite well. And the people, who were weary of Prince Tiresome and
his hippopotamuses, hailed Sabrinetta and her husband as rightful
Sovereigns of the land.

[Illustration: "They saw a cloud of steam." _See page 135._]

Next morning the Prince and Princess went out to see if the dragon had
been washed ashore. They could see nothing of him; but when they looked
out toward the whirlpool they saw a cloud of steam; and the fishermen
reported that the water for miles around was hot enough to shave with!
And as the water is hot there to this day, we may feel pretty sure
that the fierceness of that dragon was such that all the waters of all
the sea were not enough to cool him. The whirlpool is too strong for him
to be able to get out of it, so there he spins around and around forever
and ever, doing some useful work at last, and warming the water for poor
fisher-folk to shave with.

       *       *       *       *       *

The Prince and Princess rule the land well and wisely. The nurse lives
with them, and does nothing but fine sewing, and only that when she
wants to very much. The Prince keeps no hippopotamuses, and is
consequently very popular. The five and seventy devoted pigs live in
white marble sties with brass knockers and Pig on the doorplate, and are
washed twice a day with Turkish sponges and soap scented with violets,
and no one objects to their following the Prince when he walks abroad,
for they behave beautifully, and always keep to the footpath, and obey
the notices about not walking on the grass. The Princess feeds them
every day with her own hands, and her first edict on coming to the
throne was that the word _pork_ should never be uttered on pain of
death, and should, besides, be scratched out of all the dictionaries.




[Illustration: VIII

KIND LITTLE EDMUND]




VIII. Kind Little Edmund, or The Caves and the Cockatrice


Edmund was a boy. The people who did not like him said that he was the
most tiresome boy that ever lived, but his grandmother and his other
friends said that he had an inquiring mind. And his granny often added
that he was the best of boys. But she was very kind and very old.

Edmund loved to find out about things. Perhaps you will think that in
that case he was constant in his attendance at school, since there, if
anywhere, we may learn whatever there is to be learned. But Edmund did
not want to learn things: He wanted to find things out, which is quite
different. His inquiring mind led him to take clocks to pieces to see
what made them go, to take locks off doors to see what made them stick.
It was Edmund who cut open the India rubber ball to see what made it
bounce, and he never did see, any more than you did when you tried the
same experiment.

Edmund lived with his grandmother. She loved him very much, in spite of
his inquiring mind, and hardly scolded him at all when he frizzled up
her tortoiseshell comb in his anxiety to find out whether it was made of
real tortoiseshell or of something that would burn. Edmund went to
school, of course, now and then, and sometimes he could not prevent
himself from learning something, but he never did it on purpose.

"It is such waste of time," said he. "They only know what everybody
knows. I want to find out new things that nobody has thought of but me."

"I don't think you're likely to find out anything that none of the wise
men in the whole world have thought of all these thousands of years,"
said Granny.

But Edmund did not agree with her. He played truant whenever he could,
for he was a kindhearted boy, and could not bear to think of a master's
time and labor being thrown away on a boy like himself--who did not wish
to learn, only to find out--when there were so many worthy lads
thirsting for instruction in geography and history and reading and
ciphering, and Mr. Smiles's "Self-Help."

Other boys played truant too, of course--and these went nutting or
blackberrying or wild plum gathering, but Edmund never went on the side
of the town where the green woods and hedges grew. He always went up the
mountain where the great rocks were, and the tall, dark pine trees, and
where other people were afraid to go because of the strange noises that
came out of the caves.

Edmund was not afraid of these noises--though they were very strange and
terrible. He wanted to find out what made them.

One day he did. He had invented, all by himself, a very ingenious and
new kind of lantern, made with a turnip and a tumbler, and when he took
the candle out of Granny's bedroom candlestick to put in it, it gave
quite a splendid light.

He had to go to school next day, and he was caned for being absent
without leave--although he very straightforwardly explained that he had
been too busy making the lantern to have time to come to school.

But the day after he got up very early and took the lunch Granny had
ready for him to take to school--two boiled eggs and an apple
turnover--and he took his lantern and went off as straight as a dart to
the mountains to explore the caves.

The caves were very dark, but his lantern lighted them up beautifully;
and they were most interesting caves, with stalactites and stalagmites
and fossils, and all the things you read about in the instructive books
for the young. But Edmund did not care for any of these things just
then. He wanted to find out what made the noises that people were afraid
of, and there was nothing in the caves to tell him.

Presently he sat down in the biggest cave and listened very carefully,
and it seemed to him that he could distinguish three different sorts of
noises. There was a heavy rumbling sound, like a very large old
gentleman asleep after dinner; and there was a smaller sort of rumble
going on at the same time; and there was a sort of crowing, clucking
sound, such as a chicken might make if it happened to be as big as a
haystack.

"It seems to me," said Edmund to himself, "that the clucking is nearer
than the others." So he started up again and explored the caves once
more. He found out nothing, but about halfway up the wall of the cave,
he saw a hole. And, being a boy, he climbed up to it and crept in; and
it was the entrance to a rocky passage. And now the clucking sounded
more plainly than before, and he could hardly hear the rumbling at all.

"I _am_ going to find out something at last," said Edmund, and on he
went. The passage wound and twisted, and twisted and turned, and turned
and wound, but Edmund kept on.

"My lantern's burning better and better," said he presently, but the
next minute he saw that all the light did not come from his lantern. It
was a pale yellow light, and it shone down the passage far ahead of him
through what looked like the chink of a door.

"I expect it's the fire in the middle of the earth," said Edmund, who
had not been able to help learning about that at school.

But quite suddenly the fire ahead gave a pale flicker and went down; and
the clucking ceased.

The next moment Edmund turned a corner and found himself in front of a
rocky door. The door was ajar. He went in, and there was a round cave,
like the dome of St. Paul's. In the middle of the cave was a hole like a
very big hand-washing basin, and in the middle of the basin Edmund saw
a large pale person sitting.

This person had a man's face and a griffin's body, and big feathery
wings, and a snake's tail, and a cock's comb and neck feathers.

"Whatever are you?" said Edmund.

"I'm a poor starving cockatrice," answered the pale person in a very
faint voice, "and I shall die--oh, I know I shall! My fire's gone out! I
can't think how it happened; I must have been asleep. I have to stir it
seven times round with my tail once in a hundred years to keep it
alight, and my watch must have been wrong. And now I shall die."

I think I have said before what a kindhearted boy Edmund was.

"Cheer up," said he. "I'll light your fire for you." And off he went,
and in a few minutes he came back with a great armful of sticks from the
pine trees outside, and with these and a lesson book or two that he had
forgotten to lose before, and which, quite by an oversight, were safe in
his pocket, he lit a fire all around the cockatrice. The wood blazed up,
and presently something in the basin caught fire, and Edmund saw that it
was a sort of liquid that burned like the brandy in a snapdragon. And
now the cockatrice stirred it with his tail and flapped his wings in it
so that some of it splashed out on Edmund's hand and burnt it rather
badly. But the cockatrice grew red and strong and happy, and its comb
grew scarlet, and its feathers glossy, and it lifted itself up and
crowed "Cock-a-trice-a-doodle-doo!" very loudly and clearly.

Edmund's kindly nature was charmed to see the cockatrice so much
improved in health, and he said: "Don't mention it; delighted, I'm
sure," when the cockatrice began to thank him.

"But what can I do for you?" said the creature.

"Tell me stories," said Edmund.

"What about?" said the cockatrice.

"About true things that they don't know at school," said Edmund.

So the cockatrice began, and he told him about mines and treasures and
geological formations, and about gnomes and fairies and dragons, and
about glaciers and the Stone Age and the beginning of the world, and
about the unicorn and the phoenix, and about Magic, black and white.

And Edmund ate his eggs and his turnover, and listened. And when he got
hungry again he said good-bye and went home. But he came again the next
day for more stories, and the next day, and the next, for a long time.

He told the boys at school about the cockatrice and his wonderful true
tales, and the boys liked the stories; but when he told the master he
was caned for untruthfulness.

"But it's true," said Edmund. "Just you look where the fire burnt my
hand."

"I see you've been playing with fire--into mischief as usual," said the
master, and he caned Edmund harder than ever. The master was ignorant
and unbelieving: but I am told that some schoolmasters are not like
that.

Now, one day Edmund made a new lantern out of something chemical that he
sneaked from the school laboratory. And with it he went exploring again
to see if he could find the things that made the other sorts of noises.
And in quite another part of the mountain he found a dark passage, all
lined with brass, so that it was like the inside of a huge telescope,
and at the very end of it he found a bright green door. There was a
brass plate on the door that said MRS. D. KNOCK AND RING, and a white
label that said CALL ME AT THREE. Edmund had a watch: It had been given
to him on his birthday two days before, and he had not yet had time to
take it to pieces and see what made it go, so it was still going. He
looked at it now. It said a quarter to three.

Did I tell you before what a kindhearted boy Edmund was? He sat down on
the brass doorstep and waited till three o'clock. Then he knocked and
rang, and there was a rattling and puffing inside. The great door flew
open, and Edmund had only just time to hide behind it when out came an
immense yellow dragon, who wriggled off down the brass cave like a long,
rattling worm--or perhaps more like a monstrous centipede.

Edmund crept slowly out and saw the dragon stretching herself on the
rocks in the sun, and he crept past the great creature and tore down the
hill into the town and burst into school, crying out: "There's a great
dragon coming! Somebody ought to do something, or we shall all be
destroyed."

He was caned for untruthfulness without any delay. His master was never
one for postponing a duty.

"But it's true," said Edmund. "You just see if it isn't."

He pointed out of the window, and everyone could see a vast yellow cloud
rising up into the air above the mountain.

"It's only a thunder shower," said the master, and caned Edmund more
than ever. This master was not like some masters I know: He was very
obstinate, and would not believe his own eyes if they told him anything
different from what he had been saying before his eyes spoke.

So while the master was writing _Lying is very wrong, and liars must be
caned. It is all for their own good_ on the black-board for Edmund to
copy out seven hundred times, Edmund sneaked out of school and ran for
his life across the town to warn his granny, but she was not at home. So
then he made off through the back door of the town, and raced up the
hill to tell the cockatrice and ask for his help. It never occurred to
him that the cockatrice might not believe him. You see, he had heard so
many wonderful tales from him and had believed them all--and when you
believe all a person's stories they ought to believe yours. This is only
fair.

At the mouth of the cockatrice's cave Edmund stopped, very much out of
breath, to look back at the town. As he ran he had felt his little legs
tremble and shake, while the shadows of the great yellow cloud fell upon
him. Now he stood once more between warm earth and blue sky, and looked
down on the green plain dotted with fruit trees and red-roofed farms
and plots of gold corn. In the middle of that plain the gray town lay,
with its strong walls with the holes pierced for the archers, and its
square towers with holes for dropping melted lead on the heads of
strangers; its bridges and its steeples; the quiet river edged with
willow and alder; and the pleasant green garden place in the middle of
the town, where people sat on holidays to smoke their pipes and listen
to the band.

Edmund saw it all; and he saw, too, creeping across the plain, marking
her way by a black line as everything withered at her touch, the great
yellow dragon--and he saw that she was many times bigger than the whole
town.

"Oh, my poor, dear granny," said Edmund, for he had a feeling heart, as
I ought to have told you before.

The yellow dragon crept nearer and nearer, licking her greedy lips with
her long red tongue, and Edmund knew that in the school his master was
still teaching earnestly and still not believing Edmund's tale the least
little bit.

"He'll jolly well have to believe it soon, anyhow," said Edmund to
himself, and though he was a very tender-hearted boy--I think it only
fair to tell you that he was this--I am afraid he was not as sorry as he
ought to have been to think of the way in which his master was going to
learn how to believe what Edmund said. Then the dragon opened her jaws
wider and wider and wider. Edmund shut his eyes, for though his master
was in the town, the amiable Edmund shrank from beholding the awful
sight.

When he opened his eyes again there was no town--only a bare place where
it had stood, and the dragon licking her lips and curling herself up to
go to sleep, just as Kitty does when she has quite finished with a
mouse. Edmund gasped once or twice, and then ran into the cave to tell
the cockatrice.

"Well," said the cockatrice thoughtfully, when the tale had been told.
"What then?"

"I don't think you quite understand," said Edmund gently. "The dragon
has swallowed up the town."

"Does it matter?" said the cockatrice.

[Illustration: "Creeping across the plain." _See page 147._]

"But I live there," said Edmund blankly.

"Never mind," said the cockatrice, turning over in the pool of fire to
warm its other side, which was chilly, because Edmund had, as usual,
forgotten to close the cave door. "You can live here with me."

"I'm afraid I haven't made my meaning clear," said Edmund patiently.
"You see, my granny is in the town, and I can't bear to lose my granny
like this."

"I don't know what a granny may be," said the cockatrice, who seemed to
be growing weary of the subject, "but if it's a possession to which you
attach any importance----"

"Of course it is," said Edmund, losing patience at last. "Oh--do help
me. What can I do?"

"If I were you," said his friend, stretching itself out in the pool of
flame so that the waves covered him up to his chin, "I should find the
drakling and bring it here."

"But why?" said Edmund. He had gotten into the habit of asking why at
school, and the master had always found it trying. As for the
cockatrice, he was not going to stand that sort of thing for a moment.

"Oh, don't talk to me!" he said, splashing angrily in the flames. "I
give you advice; take it or leave it--I shan't bother about you anymore.
If you bring the drakling here to me, I'll tell you what to do next. If
not, not."

And the cockatrice drew the fire up close around his shoulders, tucked
himself up in it, and went to sleep.

Now this was exactly the right way to manage Edmund, only no one had
ever thought of trying to do it before.

He stood for a moment looking at the cockatrice; the cockatrice looked
at Edmund out of the corner of his eye and began to snore very loudly,
and Edmund understood, once and for all, that the cockatrice wasn't
going to put up with any nonsense. He respected the cockatrice very much
from that moment, and set off at once to do exactly as he was told--for
perhaps the first time in his life.

Though he had played truant so often, he knew one or two things that
perhaps you don't know, though you have always been so good and gone to
school regularly. For instance, he knew that a drakling is a dragon's
baby, and he felt sure that what he had to do was to find the third of
the three noises that people used to hear coming from the mountains. Of
course, the clucking had been the cockatrice, and the big noise like a
large gentleman asleep after dinner had been the big dragon. So the
smaller rumbling must have been the drakling.

He plunged boldly into the caves and searched and wandered and wandered
and searched, and at last he came to a third door in the mountain, and
on it was written THE BABY IS ASLEEP. Just before the door stood fifty
pairs of copper shoes, and no one could have looked at them for a moment
without seeing what sort of feet they were made for, for each shoe had
five holes in it for the drakling's five claws. And there were fifty
pairs because the drakling took after his mother, and had a hundred
feet--no more and no less. He was the kind called _Draco centipedis_ in
the learned books.

Edmund was a good deal frightened, but he remembered the grim expression
of the cockatrice's eye, and the fixed determination of his snore still
rang in his ears, in spite of the snoring of the drakling, which was, in
itself, considerable. He screwed up his courage, flung the door open,
and called out: "Hello, you drakling. Get out of bed this minute."

The drakling stopped snoring and said sleepily: "It ain't time yet."

"Your mother says you are to, anyhow; and look sharp about it, what's
more," said Edmund, gaining courage from the fact that the drakling had
not yet eaten him.

The drakling sighed, and Edmund could hear it getting out of bed. The
next moment it began to come out of its room and to put on its shoes. It
was not nearly so big as its mother; only about the size of a Baptist
chapel.

"Hurry up," said Edmund, as it fumbled clumsily with the seventeenth
shoe.

"Mother said I was never to go out without my shoes," said the
drakling; so Edmund had to help it to put them on. It took some time,
and was not a comfortable occupation.

At last the drakling said it was ready, and Edmund, who had forgotten to
be frightened, said, "Come on then," and they went back to the
cockatrice.

The cave was rather narrow for the drakling, but it made itself thin, as
you may see a fat worm do when it wants to get through a narrow crack in
a piece of hard earth.

"Here it is," said Edmund, and the cockatrice woke up at once and asked
the drakling very politely to sit down and wait. "Your mother will be
here presently," said the cockatrice, stirring up its fire.

The drakling sat down and waited, but it watched the fire with hungry
eyes.

"I beg your pardon," it said at last, "but I am always accustomed to
having a little basin of fire as soon as I get up, and I feel rather
faint. Might I?"

It reached out a claw toward the cockatrice's basin.

"Certainly not," said the cockatrice sharply. "Where were you brought
up? Did they never teach you that 'we must not ask for all we see'? Eh?"

"I beg your pardon," said the drakling humbly, "but I am really _very_
hungry."

The cockatrice beckoned Edmund to the side of the basin and whispered in
his ear so long and so earnestly that one side of the dear boy's hair
was quite burnt off. And he never once interrupted the cockatrice to ask
why. But when the whispering was over, Edmund--whose heart, as I may
have mentioned, was very tender--said to the drakling: "If you are
really hungry, poor thing, I can show you where there is plenty of
fire." And off he went through the caves, and the drakling followed.

When Edmund came to the proper place he stopped.

There was a round iron thing in the floor, like the ones the men shoot
the coals down into your cellar, only much larger. Edmund heaved it up
by a hook that stuck out at one side, and a rush of hot air came up
that nearly choked him. But the drakling came close and looked down with
one eye and sniffed, and said: "That smells good, eh?"

"Yes," said Edmund, "well, that's the fire in the middle of the earth.
There's plenty of it, all done to a turn. You'd better go down and begin
your breakfast, hadn't you?"

So the drakling wriggled through the hole, and began to crawl faster and
faster down the slanting shaft that leads to the fire in the middle of
the earth. And Edmund, doing exactly as he had been told, for a wonder,
caught the end of the drakling's tail and ran the iron hook through it
so that the drakling was held fast. And it could not turn around and
wriggle up again to look after its poor tail, because, as everyone
knows, the way to the fires below is very easy to go down, but quite
impossible to come back on. There is something about it in Latin,
beginning: "_Facilis descensus_."

So there was the drakling, fast by the silly tail of it, and there was
Edmund very busy and important and very pleased with himself, hurrying
back to the cockatrice.

"Now," said he.

"Well, now," said the cockatrice. "Go to the mouth of the cave and laugh
at the dragon so that she hears you."

Edmund very nearly said "Why?" but he stopped in time, and instead,
said: "She won't hear me--"

"Oh, very well," said the cockatrice. "No doubt you know best," and he
began to tuck himself up again in the fire, so Edmund did as he was bid.

And when he began to laugh his laughter echoed in the mouth of the cave
till it sounded like the laughter of a whole castleful of giants.

And the dragon, lying asleep in the sun, woke up and said very crossly:
"What are you laughing at?"

[Illustration: "That smells good, eh?" _See page 152._]

"At you," said Edmund, and went on laughing. The dragon bore it as long
as she could, but, like everyone else, she couldn't stand being made fun
of, so presently she dragged herself up the mountain very slowly,
because she had just had a rather heavy meal, and stood outside and
said, "What are you laughing at?" in a voice that made Edmund feel as if
he should never laugh again.

Then the good cockatrice called out: "At you! You've eaten your own
drakling--swallowed it with the town. Your own little drakling! He, he,
he! Ha, ha, ha!"

And Edmund found the courage to cry "Ha, ha!" which sounded like
tremendous laughter in the echo of the cave.

"Dear me," said the dragon. "I _thought_ the town stuck in my throat
rather. I must take it out, and look through it more carefully." And
with that she coughed--and choked--and there was the town, on the
hillside.

Edmund had run back to the cockatrice, and it had told him what to do.
So before the dragon had time to look through the town again for her
drakling, the voice of the drakling itself was heard howling miserably
from inside the mountain, because Edmund was pinching its tail as hard
as he could in the round iron door, like the one where the men pour the
coals out of the sacks into the cellar. And the dragon heard the voice
and said: "Why, whatever's the matter with Baby? He's not here!" and
made herself thin, and crept into the mountain to find her drakling. The
cockatrice kept on laughing as loud as it could, and Edmund kept on
pinching, and presently the great dragon--very long and narrow she had
made herself--found her head where the round hole was with the iron lid.
Her tail was a mile or two off--outside the mountain. When Edmund heard
her coming he gave one last nip to the drakling's tail, and then heaved
up the lid and stood behind it, so that the dragon could not see him.
Then he loosed the drakling's tail from the hook, and the dragon peeped
down the hole just in time to see her drakling's tail disappear down the
smooth, slanting shaft with one last squeak of pain. Whatever may have
been the poor dragon's other faults, she was an excellent mother. She
plunged headfirst into the hole, and slid down the shaft after her baby.
Edmund watched her head go--and then the rest of her. She was so long,
now she had stretched herself thin, that it took all night. It was like
watching a goods train go by in Germany. When the last joint of her tail
had gone Edmund slammed down the iron door. He was a kindhearted boy, as
you have guessed, and he was glad to think that dragon and drakling
would now have plenty to eat of their favorite food, forever and ever.
He thanked the cockatrice for his kindness, and got home just in time to
have breakfast and get to school by nine. Of course, he could not have
done this if the town had been in its old place by the river in the
middle of the plain, but it had taken root on the hillside just where
the dragon left it.

"Well," said the master, "where were you yesterday?"

Edmund explained, and the master at once caned him for not speaking the
truth.

"But it _is_ true," said Edmund. "Why, the whole town was swallowed by
the dragon. You know it was--"

"Nonsense," said the master. "There was a thunderstorm and an
earthquake, that's all." And he caned Edmund more than ever.

"But," said Edmund, who always would argue, even in the least favorable
circumstances, "how do you account for the town being on the hillside
now, instead of by the river as it used to be?"

"It was _always_ on the hillside," said the master. And all the class
said the same, for they had more sense than to argue with a person who
carried a cane.

"But look at the maps," said Edmund, who wasn't going to be beaten in
argument, whatever he might be in the flesh. The master pointed to the
map on the wall.

There was the town, on the hillside! And nobody but Edmund could see
that of course the shock of being swallowed by the dragon had upset all
the maps and put them wrong.

And then the master caned Edmund again, explaining that this time it was
not for untruthfulness, but for his vexatious argumentative habits. This
will show you what a prejudiced and ignorant man Edmund's master
was--how different from the revered Head of the nice school where your
good parents are kind enough to send you.

The next day Edmund thought he would prove his tale by showing people
the cockatrice, and he actually persuaded some people to go into the
cave with him; but the cockatrice had bolted himself in and would not
open the door--so Edmund got nothing by that except a scolding for
taking people on a wild-goose chase.

"A wild goose," said they, "is nothing like a cockatrice."

And poor Edmund could not say a word, though he knew how wrong they
were. The only person who believed him was his granny. But then she was
very old and very kind, and had always said he was the best of boys.

Only one good thing came of all this long story. Edmund has never been
quite the same boy since. He does not argue quite so much, and he agreed
to be apprenticed to a locksmith, so that he might one day be able to
pick the lock of the cockatrice's front door--and learn some more of the
things that other people don't know.

But he is quite an old man now, and he hasn't gotten that door open
yet!

CHAPTER I

BEAUTIFUL AS THE DAY


The house was three miles from the station, but, before the dusty hired
hack had rattled along for five minutes, the children began to put their
heads out of the carriage window and say, "Aren't we nearly there?" And
every time they passed a house, which was not very often, they all said,
"Oh, _is_ this it?" But it never was, till they reached the very top of
the hill, just past the chalk-quarry and before you come to the
gravel-pit. And then there was a white house with a green garden and an
orchard beyond, and mother said, "Here we are!"

"How white the house is," said Robert.

"And look at the roses," said Anthea.

"And the plums," said Jane.

"It is rather decent," Cyril admitted.

The Baby said, "Wanty go walky;" and the hack stopped with a last rattle
and jolt.

Everyone got its legs kicked or its feet trodden on in the scramble to
get out of the carriage that very minute, but no one seemed to mind.
Mother, curiously enough, was in no hurry to get out; and even when she
had come down slowly and by the step, and with no jump at all, she
seemed to wish to see the boxes carried in, and even to pay the driver,
instead of joining in that first glorious rush round the garden and
orchard and the thorny, thistly, briery, brambly wilderness beyond the
broken gate and the dry fountain at the side of the house. But the
children were wiser, for once. It was not really a pretty house at all;
it was quite ordinary, and mother thought it was rather inconvenient,
and was quite annoyed at there being no shelves, to speak of, and hardly
a cupboard in the place. Father used to say that the iron-work on the
roof and coping was like an architect's nightmare. But the house was
deep in the country, with no other house in sight, and the children had
been in London for two years, without so much as once going to the
seaside even for a day by an excursion train, and so the White House
seemed to them a sort of Fairy Palace set down in an Earthly Paradise.
For London is like prison for children, especially if their relations
are not rich.

[Illustration: That first glorious rush round the garden]

Of course there are the shops and theatres, and entertainments and
things, but if your people are rather poor you don't get taken to the
theatres, and you can't buy things out of the shops; and London has none
of those nice things that children may play with without hurting the
things or themselves--such as trees and sand and woods and waters. And
nearly everything in London is the wrong sort of shape--all straight
lines and flat streets, instead of being all sorts of odd shapes, like
things are in the country. Trees are all different, as you know, and I
am sure some tiresome person must have told you that there are no two
blades of grass exactly alike. But in streets, where the blades of grass
don't grow, everything is like everything else. This is why many
children who live in the towns are so extremely naughty. They do not
know what is the matter with them, and no more do their fathers and
mothers, aunts, uncles, cousins, tutors, governesses, and nurses; but I
know. And so do you, now. Children in the country are naughty sometimes,
too, but that is for quite different reasons.

The children had explored the gardens and the outhouses thoroughly
before they were caught and cleaned for tea, and they saw quite well
that they were certain to be happy at the White House. They thought so
from the first moment, but when they found the back of the house covered
with jasmine, all in white flower, and smelling like a bottle of the
most expensive perfume that is ever given for a birthday present; and
when they had seen the lawn, all green and smooth, and quite different
from the brown grass in the gardens at Camden Town; and when they found
the stable with a loft over it and some old hay still left, they were
almost certain; and when Robert had found the broken swing and tumbled
out of it and got a bump on his head the size of an egg, and Cyril had
nipped his finger in the door of a hutch that seemed made to keep
rabbits in, if you ever had any, they had no longer any doubts
whatever.

[Illustration: Cyril had nipped his finger in the door of a hutch]

The best part of it all was that there were no rules about not going to
places and not doing things. In London almost everything is labelled
"You mustn't touch," and though the label is invisible it's just as bad,
because you know it's there, or if you don't you very soon get told.

The White House was on the edge of a hill, with a wood behind it--and
the chalk-quarry on one side and the gravel-pit on the other. Down at
the bottom of the hill was a level plain, with queer-shaped white
buildings where people burnt lime, and a big red brewery and other
houses; and when the big chimneys were smoking and the sun was setting,
the valley looked as if it was filled with golden mist, and the
limekilns and hop-drying houses glimmered and glittered till they were
like an enchanted city out of the _Arabian Nights_.

Now that I have begun to tell you about the place, I feel that I could
go on and make this into a most interesting story about all the
ordinary things that the children did,--just the kind of things you do
yourself, you know, and you would believe every word of it; and when I
told about the children's being tiresome, as you are sometimes, your
aunts would perhaps write in the margin of the story with a pencil, "How
true!" or "How like life!" and you would see it and would very likely be
annoyed. So I will only tell you the really astonishing things that
happened, and you may leave the book about quite safely, for no aunts
and uncles either are likely to write "How true!" on the edge of the
story. Grown-up people find it very difficult to believe really
wonderful things, unless they have what they call proof. But children
will believe almost anything, and grown-ups know this. That is why they
tell you that the earth is round like an orange, when you can see
perfectly well that it is flat and lumpy; and why they say that the
earth goes round the sun, when you can see for yourself any day that the
sun gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night like a good sun as
it is, and the earth knows its place, and lies as still as a mouse. Yet
I daresay you believe all that about the earth and the sun, and if so
you will find it quite easy to believe that before Anthea and Cyril and
the others had been a week in the country they had found a fairy. At
least they called it that, because that was what it called itself; and
of course it knew best, but it was not at all like any fairy you ever
saw or heard of or read about.

It was at the gravel-pits. Father had to go away suddenly on business,
and mother had gone away to stay with Granny, who was not very well.
They both went in a great hurry, and when they were gone the house
seemed dreadfully quiet and empty, and the children wandered from one
room to another and looked at the bits of paper and string on the floors
left over from the packing, and not yet cleared up, and wished they had
something to do. It was Cyril who said--

"I say, let's take our spades and dig in the gravel-pits. We can pretend
it's seaside."

"Father says it was once," Anthea said; "he says there are shells there
thousands of years old."

So they went. Of course they had been to the edge of the gravel-pit and
looked over, but they had not gone down into it for fear father should
say they mustn't play there, and it was the same with the chalk-quarry.
The gravel-pit is not really dangerous if you don't try to climb down
the edges, but go the slow safe way round by the road, as if you were a
cart.

Each of the children carried its own spade, and took it in turns to
carry the Lamb. He was the baby, and they called him that because "Baa"
was the first thing he ever said. They called Anthea "Panther," which
seems silly when you read it, but when you say it it sounds a little
like her name.

The gravel-pit is very large and wide, with grass growing round the
edges at the top, and dry stringy wildflowers, purple and yellow. It is
like a giant's washbowl. And there are mounds of gravel, and holes in
the sides of the bowl where gravel has been taken out, and high up in
the steep sides there are the little holes that are the little front
doors of the little bank-martins' little houses.

The children built a castle, of course, but castle-building is rather
poor fun when you have no hope of the swishing tide ever coming in to
fill up the moat and wash away the drawbridge, and, at the happy last,
to wet everybody up to the waist at least.

Cyril wanted to dig out a cave to play smugglers in, but the others
thought it might bury them alive, so it ended in all spades going to
work to dig a hole through the castle to Australia. These children, you
see, believed that the world was round, and that on the other side the
little Australian boys and girls were really walking wrong way up, like
flies on the ceiling, with their heads hanging down into the air.

The children dug and they dug and they dug, and their hands got sandy
and hot and red, and their faces got damp and shiny. The Lamb had tried
to eat the sand, and had cried so hard when he found that it was not,
as he had supposed, brown sugar, that he was now tired out, and was
lying asleep in a warm fat bunch in the middle of the half-finished
castle. This left his brothers and sisters free to work really hard, and
the hole that was to come out in Australia soon grew so deep that Jane,
who was called Pussy for short, begged the others to stop.

"Suppose the bottom of the hole gave way suddenly," said she, "and you
tumbled out among the little Australians, all the sand would get in
their eyes."

"Yes," said Robert; "and they would hate us, and throw stones at us, and
not let us see the kangaroos, or opossums, or bluegums, or Emu Brand
birds, or anything."

Cyril and Anthea knew that Australia was not quite so near as all that,
but they agreed to stop using the spades and to go on with their hands.
This was quite easy, because the sand at the bottom of the hole was very
soft and fine and dry, like sea-sand. And there were little shells in
it.

"Fancy it having been wet sea here once, all sloppy and shiny," said
Jane, "with fishes and conger-eels and coral and mermaids."

"And masts of ships and wrecked Spanish treasure. I wish we could find a
gold doubloon, or something," Cyril said.

"How did the sea get carried away?" Robert asked.

"Not in a pail, silly," said his brother.

"Father says the earth got too hot underneath, as you do in bed
sometimes, so it just hunched up its shoulders, and the sea had to slip
off, like the blankets do us, and the shoulder was left sticking out,
and turned into dry land. Let's go and look for shells; I think that
little cave looks likely, and I see something sticking out there like a
bit of wrecked ship's anchor, and it's beastly hot in the Australian
hole."

The others agreed, but Anthea went on digging. She always liked to
finish a thing when she had once begun it. She felt it would be a
disgrace to leave that hole without getting through to Australia.

The cave was disappointing, because there were no shells, and the
wrecked ship's anchor turned out to be only the broken end of a pick-axe
handle, and the cave party were just making up their minds that sand
makes you thirstier when it is not by the seaside, and someone had
suggested that they all go home for lemonade, when Anthea suddenly
screamed--

"Cyril! Come here! Oh, come quick--It's alive! It'll get away! Quick!"

They all hurried back.

"It's a rat, I shouldn't wonder," said Robert. "Father says they infest
old places--and this must be pretty old if the sea was here thousands of
years ago"--

"Perhaps it is a snake," said Jane, shuddering.

"Let's look," said Cyril, jumping into the hole. "I'm not afraid of
snakes. I like them. If it is a snake I'll tame it, and it will follow
me everywhere, and I'll let it sleep round my neck at night."

"No, you won't," said Robert firmly. He shared Cyril's bedroom. "But
you may if it's a rat."

[Illustration: Anthea suddenly screamed, "It's alive!"]

"Oh, don't be silly!" said Anthea; "it's not a rat, it's _much_ bigger.
And it's not a snake. It's got feet; I saw them; and fur! No--not the
spade. You'll hurt it! Dig with your hands."

"And let _it_ hurt _me_ instead! That's so likely, isn't it?" said
Cyril, seizing a spade.

"Oh, don't!" said Anthea. "Squirrel, _don't_. I--it sounds silly, but it
said something. It really and truly did"--

"What?"

"It said, 'You let me alone.'"

But Cyril merely observed that his sister must have gone off her head,
and he and Robert dug with spades while Anthea sat on the edge of the
hole, jumping up and down with hotness and anxiety. They dug carefully,
and presently everyone could see that there really was something moving
in the bottom of the Australian hole.

Then Anthea cried out, "_I'm_ not afraid. Let me dig," and fell on her
knees and began to scratch like a dog does when he has suddenly
remembered where it was that he buried his bone.

"Oh, I felt fur," she cried, half laughing and half crying. "I did
indeed! I did!" when suddenly a dry husky voice in the sand made them
all jump back, and their hearts jumped nearly as fast as they did.

"Let me alone," it said. And now everyone heard the voice and looked at
the others to see if they had heard it too.

"But we want to see you," said Robert bravely.

"I wish you'd come out," said Anthea, also taking courage.

"Oh, well--if that's your wish," the voice said, and the sand stirred
and spun and scattered, and something brown and furry and fat came
rolling out into the hole, and the sand fell off it, and it sat there
yawning and rubbing the ends of its eyes with its hands.

"I believe I must have dropped asleep," it said, stretching itself.

The children stood round the hole in a ring, looking at the creature
they had found. It was worth looking at. Its eyes were on long horns
like a snail's eyes, and it could move them in and out like telescopes;
it had ears like a bat's ears, and its tubby body was shaped like a
spider's and covered with thick soft fur; its legs and arms were furry
too, and it had hands and feet like a monkey's.

"What on earth is it?" Jane said. "Shall we take it home?"

The thing turned its long eyes to look at her, and said--

"Does she always talk nonsense, or is it only the rubbish on her head
that makes her silly?"

It looked scornfully at Jane's hat as it spoke.

"She doesn't mean to be silly," Anthea said gently; "we none of us do,
whatever you may think! Don't be frightened; we don't want to hurt you,
you know."

"Hurt _me_!" it said. "_Me_ frightened? Upon my word! Why, you talk as
if I were nobody in particular." All its fur stood out like a cat's when
it is going to fight.

"Well," said Anthea, still kindly, "perhaps if we knew who you are in
particular we could think of something to say that wouldn't make you
angry. Everything we've said so far seems to have done so. Who are you?
And don't get angry! Because really we don't know."

"You don't know?" it said. "Well, I knew the world had
changed--but--well, really--Do you mean to tell me seriously you don't
know a Psammead when you see one?"

"A Sammyadd? That's Greek to me."

"So it is to everyone," said the creature sharply. "Well, in plain
English, then, a _Sand-fairy_. Don't you know a Sand-fairy when you see
one?"

It looked so grieved and hurt that Jane hastened to say, "Of course I
see you are, _now_. It's quite plain now one comes to look at you."

"You came to look at me, several sentences ago," it said crossly,
beginning to curl up again in the sand.

"Oh--don't go away again! Do talk some more," Robert cried. "I didn't
know you were a Sand-fairy, but I knew directly I saw you that you were
much the wonderfullest thing I'd ever seen."

The Sand-fairy seemed a shade less disagreeable after this.

"It isn't talking I mind," it said, "as long as you're reasonably civil.
But I'm not going to make polite conversation for you. If you talk
nicely to me, perhaps I'll answer you, and perhaps I won't. Now say
something."

Of course no one could think of anything to say, but at last Robert
thought of "How long have you lived here?" and he said it at once.

"Oh, ages--several thousand years," replied the Psammead.

"Tell us about it. Do."

"It's all in books."

"_You_ aren't!" Jane said. "Oh, tell us everything you can about
yourself! We don't know anything about you, and you _are_ so nice."

The Sand-fairy smoothed his long rat-like whiskers and smiled between
them.

"Do please tell!" said the children all together.

It is wonderful how quickly you get used to things, even the most
astonishing. Five minutes before, the children had had no more idea than
you had that there was such a thing as a Sand-fairy in the world, and
now they were talking to it as though they had known it all their lives.

It drew its eyes in and said--

"How very sunny it is--quite like old times! Where do you get your
Megatheriums from now?"

"What?" said the children all at once. It is very difficult always to
remember that "what" is not polite, especially in moments of surprise or
agitation.

"Are Pterodactyls plentiful now?" the Sand-fairy went on.

The children were unable to reply.

"What do you have for breakfast?" the Fairy said impatiently, "and who
gives it to you?"

"Eggs and bacon, and bread and milk, and porridge and things.
Mother gives it to us. What are Mega-what's-its-names and
Ptero-what-do-you-call-thems? And does anyone have them for breakfast?"

"Why, almost everyone had Pterodactyl for breakfast in my time!
Pterodactyls were something like crocodiles and something like birds--I
believe they were very good grilled. You see, it was like this: of
course there were heaps of Sand-fairies then, and in the morning early
you went out and hunted for them, and when you'd found one it gave you
your wish. People used to send their little boys down to the seashore in
the morning before breakfast to get the day's wishes, and very often the
eldest boy in the family would be told to wish for a Megatherium, ready
jointed for cooking. It was as big as an elephant, you see, so there was
a good deal of meat on it. And if they wanted fish, the Ichthyosaurus
was asked for,--he was twenty to forty feet long, so there was plenty of
him. And for poultry there was the Plesiosaurus; there were nice
pickings on that too. Then the other children could wish for other
things. But when people had dinner-parties it was nearly always
Megatheriums; and Ichthyosaurus, because his fins were a great delicacy
and his tail made soup."

"There must have been heaps and heaps of cold meat left over," said
Anthea, who meant to be a good housekeeper some day.

"Oh no," said the Psammead, "that would never have done. Why, of course
at sunset what was left over turned into stone. You find the stone bones
of the Megatherium and things all over the place even now, they tell
me."

"Who tell you?" asked Cyril; but the Sand-fairy frowned and began to dig
very fast with its furry hands.

"Oh, don't go!" they all cried; "tell us more about when it was
Megatheriums for breakfast! Was the world like this then?"

It stopped digging.

"Not a bit," it said; "it was nearly all sand where I lived, and coal
grew on trees, and the periwinkles were as big as tea-trays--you find
them now; they're turned into stone. We Sand-fairies used to live on the
seashore, and the children used to come with their little flint-spades
and flint-pails and make castles for us to live in. That's thousands of
years ago, but I hear that children still build castles on the sand.
It's difficult to break yourself of a habit."

"But why did you stop living in the castles?" asked Robert.

"It's a sad story," said the Psammead gloomily. "It was because they
_would_ build moats to the castles, and the nasty wet bubbling sea used
to come in, and of course as soon as a Sand-fairy got wet it caught
cold, and generally died. And so there got to be fewer and fewer, and,
whenever you found a fairy and had a wish, you used to wish for a
Megatherium, and eat twice as much as you wanted, because it might be
weeks before you got another wish."

"And did _you_ get wet?" Robert inquired.

The Sand-fairy shuddered. "Only once," it said; "the end of the twelfth
hair of my top left whisker--I feel the place still in damp weather. It
was only once, but it was quite enough for me. I went away as soon as
the sun had dried my poor dear whisker. I scurried away to the back of
the beach, and dug myself a house deep in warm dry sand, and there I've
been ever since. And the sea changed its lodgings afterwards. And now
I'm not going to tell you another thing."

"Just one more, please," said the children. "Can you give wishes now?"

"Of course," said it; "didn't I give you yours a few minutes ago? You
said, 'I wish you'd come out,' and I did."

"Oh, please, mayn't we have another?"

"Yes, but be quick about it. I'm tired of you."

I daresay you have often thought what you would do if you had three
wishes given you, and have despised the old man and his wife in the
black-pudding story, and felt certain that if you had the chance you
could think of three really useful wishes without a moment's hesitation.
These children had often talked this matter over, but, now the chance
had suddenly come to them, they could not make up their minds.

"Quick," said the Sand-fairy crossly. No one could think of anything,
only Anthea did manage to remember a private wish of her own and Jane's
which they had never told the boys. She knew the boys would not care
about it--but still it was better than nothing.

"I wish we were all as beautiful as the day," she said in a great hurry.

The children looked at each other, but each could see that the others
were not any better-looking than usual. The Psammead pushed out his long
eyes, and seemed to be holding its breath and swelling itself out till
it was twice as fat and furry as before. Suddenly it let its breath go
in a long sigh.

"I'm really afraid I can't manage it," it said apologetically; "I must
be out of practice."

The children were horribly disappointed.

"Oh, _do_ try again!" they said.

"Well," said the Sand-fairy, "the fact is, I was keeping back a little
strength to give the rest of you your wishes with. If you'll be
contented with one wish a day among the lot of you I daresay I can
screw myself up to it. Do you agree to that?"

"Yes, oh yes!" said Jane and Anthea. The boys nodded. They did not
believe the Sand-fairy could do it. You can always make girls believe
things much easier than you can boys.

It stretched out its eyes farther than ever, and swelled and swelled and
swelled.

"I do hope it won't hurt itself," said Anthea.

"Or crack its skin," Robert said anxiously.

Everyone was very much relieved when the Sand-fairy, after getting so
big that it almost filled up the hole in the sand, suddenly let out its
breath and went back to its proper size.

"That's all right," it said, panting heavily. "It'll come easier
to-morrow."

"Did it hurt much?" said Anthea.

"Only my poor whisker, thank you," said he, "but you're a kind and
thoughtful child. Good day."

It scratched suddenly and fiercely with its hands and feet, and
disappeared in the sand.

Then the children looked at each other, and each child suddenly found
itself alone with three perfect strangers, all radiantly beautiful.

They stood for some moments in silence. Each thought that its brothers
and sisters had wandered off, and that these strange children had stolen
up unnoticed while it was watching the swelling form of the Sand-fairy.
Anthea spoke first--

"Excuse me," she said very politely to Jane, who now had enormous blue
eyes and a cloud of russet hair, "but have you seen two little boys and
a little girl anywhere about?"

"I was just going to ask you that," said Jane. And then Cyril cried--

"Why, it's _you_! I know the hole in your pinafore! You _are_ Jane,
aren't you? And you're the Panther; I can see your dirty handkerchief
that you forgot to change after you'd cut your thumb! The wish _has_
come off, after all. I say, am I as handsome as you are?"

"If you're Cyril, I liked you much better as you were before," said
Anthea decidedly. "You look like the picture of the young chorister,
with your golden hair; you'll die young, I shouldn't wonder. And if
that's Robert, he's like an Italian organ-grinder. His hair's all
black."

"You two girls are like Christmas cards, then--that's all--silly
Christmas cards," said Robert angrily. "And Jane's hair is simply
carrots."

It was indeed of that Venetian tint so much admired by artists.

"Well, it's no use finding fault with each other," said Anthea; "let's
get the Lamb and lug it home to dinner. The servants will admire us most
awfully, you'll see."

Baby was just waking up when they got to him, and not one of the
children but was relieved to find that he at least was not as beautiful
as the day, but just the same as usual.

"I suppose he's too young to have wishes naturally," said Jane. "We
shall have to mention him specially next time."

Anthea ran forward and held out her arms.

"Come, then," she said.

The Baby looked at her disapprovingly, and put a sandy pink thumb in his
mouth. Anthea was his favourite sister.

"Come, then," she said.

"G'way 'long!" said the Baby.

"Come to own Pussy," said Jane.

"Wants my Panty," said the Lamb dismally, and his lip trembled.

"Here, come on, Veteran," said Robert, "come and have a yidey on Yobby's
back."

"Yah, narky narky boy," howled the Baby, giving way altogether. Then the
children knew the worst. _The Baby did not know them!_

[Illustration: The baby did not know them!]

They looked at each other in despair, and it was terrible to each, in
this dire emergency, to meet only the beautiful eyes of perfect
strangers, instead of the merry, friendly, commonplace, twinkling, jolly
little eyes of its own brothers and sisters.

"This is most truly awful," said Cyril when he had tried to lift up the
Lamb, and the Lamb had scratched like a cat and bellowed like a bull!
"We've got to _make friends_ with him! I can't carry him home screaming
like that. Fancy having to make friends with our own baby!--it's too
silly."

That, however, was exactly what they had to do. It took over an hour,
and the task was not rendered any easier by the fact that the Lamb was
by this time as hungry as a lion and as thirsty as a desert.

At last he consented to allow these strangers to carry him home by
turns, but as he refused to hold on to such new acquaintances he was a
dead weight, and most exhausting.

"Thank goodness, we're home!" said Jane, staggering through the iron
gate to where Martha, the nursemaid, stood at the front door shading her
eyes with her hand and looking out anxiously. "Here! Do take Baby!"

Martha snatched the Baby from her arms.

"Thanks be, _he's_ safe back," she said. "Where are the others, and
whoever to goodness gracious are all of you?"

"We're _us_, of course," said Robert.

"And who's Us, when you're at home?" asked Martha scornfully.

"I tell you it's _us_, only we're beautiful as the day," said Cyril.
"I'm Cyril, and these are the others, and we're jolly hungry. Let us in,
and don't be a silly idiot."

Martha merely dratted Cyril's impudence and tried to shut the door in
his face.

"I know we _look_ different, but I'm Anthea, and we're so tired, and
it's long past dinner-time."

"Then go home to your dinners, whoever you are; and if our children put
you up to this play-acting you can tell them from me they'll catch it,
so they know what to expect!" With that she did bang the door. Cyril
rang the bell violently. No answer. Presently cook put her head out of a
bedroom window and said--

"If you don't take yourselves off, and that precious sharp, I'll go and
fetch the police." And she slammed down the window.

"It's no good," said Anthea. "Oh, do, do come away before we get sent to
prison!"

The boys said it was nonsense, and the law of England couldn't put you
in prison for just being as beautiful as the day, but all the same they
followed the others out into the lane.

"We shall be our proper selves after sunset, I suppose," said Jane.

"I don't know," Cyril said sadly; "it mayn't be like that now--things
have changed a good deal since Megatherium times."

"Oh," cried Anthea suddenly, "perhaps we shall turn into stone at
sunset, like the Megatheriums did, so that there mayn't be any of us
left over for the next day."

She began to cry, so did Jane. Even the boys turned pale. No one had the
heart to say anything.

It was a horrible afternoon. There was no house near where the children
could beg a crust of bread or even a glass of water. They were afraid to
go to the village, because they had seen Martha go down there with a
basket, and there was a local constable. True, they were all as
beautiful as the day, but that is a poor comfort when you are as hungry
as a hunter and as thirsty as a sponge.

Three times they tried in vain to get the servants in the White House to
let them in and listen to their tale. And then Robert went alone, hoping
to be able to climb in at one of the back windows and so open the door
to the others. But all the windows were out of reach, and Martha emptied
a toilet-jug of cold water over him from a top window, and said--

"Go along with you, you nasty little Eye-talian monkey."

It came at last to their sitting down in a row under the hedge, with
their feet in a dry ditch, waiting for sunset, and wondering whether,
when the sun _did_ set, they would turn into stone, or only into their
own old natural selves; and each of them still felt lonely and among
strangers, and tried not to look at the others, for, though their voices
were their own, their faces were so radiantly beautiful as to be quite
irritating to look at.

"I don't believe we _shall_ turn to stone," said Robert, breaking a long
miserable silence, "because the Sand-fairy said he'd give us another
wish to-morrow, and he couldn't if we were stone, could he?"

The others said "No," but they weren't at all comforted.

Another silence, longer and more miserable, was broken by Cyril's
suddenly saying, "I don't want to frighten you girls, but I believe it's
beginning with me already. My foot's quite dead. I'm turning to stone, I
know I am, and so will you in a minute."

"Never mind," said Robert kindly, "perhaps you'll be the only stone one,
and the rest of us will be all right, and we'll cherish your statue and
hang garlands on it."

But when it turned out that Cyril's foot had only gone to sleep through
his sitting too long with it under him, and when it came to life in an
agony of pins and needles, the others were quite cross.

"Giving us such a fright for nothing!" said Anthea.

[Illustration: Martha emptied a toilet-jug of cold water over him]

The third and miserablest silence of all was broken by Jane. She
said--

"If we _do_ come out of this all right, we'll ask the Sammyadd to make
it so that the servants don't notice anything different, no matter what
wishes we have."

The others only grunted. They were too wretched even to make good
resolutions.

At last hunger and fright and crossness and tiredness--four very nasty
things--all joined together to bring one nice thing, and that was sleep.
The children lay asleep in a row, with their beautiful eyes shut and
their beautiful mouths open. Anthea woke first. The sun had set, and the
twilight was coming on.

Anthea pinched herself very hard, to make sure, and when she found she
could still feel pinching she decided that she was not stone, and then
she pinched the others. They, also, were soft.

"Wake up," she said, almost in tears for joy; "it's all right, we're not
stone. And oh, Cyril, how nice and ugly you do look, with your old
freckles and your brown hair and your little eyes. And so do you all!"
she added, so that they might not feel jealous.

When they got home they were very much scolded by Martha, who told them
about the strange children.

"A good-looking lot, I must say, but that impudent."

"I know," said Robert, who knew by experience how hopeless it would be
to try to explain things to Martha.

"And where on earth have you been all this time, you naughty little
things, you?"

"In the lane."

"Why didn't you come home hours ago?"

"We couldn't because of _them_," said Anthea.

"Who?"

"The children who were as beautiful as the day. They kept us there till
after sunset. We couldn't come back till they'd gone. You don't know how
we hated them! Oh, do, do give us some supper--we are so hungry."

"Hungry! I should think so," said Martha angrily; "out all day like
this. Well, I hope it'll be a lesson to you not to go picking up with
strange children--down here after measles, as likely as not! Now mind,
if you see them again, don't you speak to them--not one word nor so
much as a look--but come straight away and tell me. I'll spoil their
beauty for them!"

"If ever we _do_ see them again we'll tell you," Anthea said; and
Robert, fixing his eyes fondly on the cold beef that was being brought
in on a tray by cook, added in heartfelt undertones--

"And we'll take jolly good care we never _do_ see them again."

And they never have.




CHAPTER II

GOLDEN GUINEAS


Anthea woke in the morning from a very real sort of dream, in which she
was walking in the Zoological Gardens on a pouring wet day without an
umbrella. The animals seemed desperately unhappy because of the rain,
and were all growling gloomily. When she awoke, both the growling and
the rain went on just the same. The growling was the heavy regular
breathing of her sister Jane, who had a slight cold and was still
asleep. The rain fell in slow drops on to Anthea's face from the wet
corner of a bath-towel out of which her brother Robert was gently
squeezing the water, to wake her up, as he now explained.

"Oh, drop it!" she said rather crossly; so he did, for he was not a
brutal brother, though very ingenious in apple-pie beds, booby-traps,
original methods of awakening sleeping relatives, and the other
little accomplishments which make home happy.

[Illustration: The rain fell in slow drops on to Anthea's face]

"I had such a funny dream," Anthea began.

"So did I," said Jane, wakening suddenly and without warning. "I dreamed
we found a Sand-fairy in the gravel-pits, and it said it was a Sammyadd,
and we might have a new wish every day, and"----

"But that's what _I_ dreamed," said Robert; "I was just going to tell
you,--and we had the first wish directly it said so. And I dreamed you
girls were donkeys enough to ask for us all to be beautiful as day, and
we jolly well were, and it was perfectly beastly."

"But _can_ different people all dream the same thing?" said Anthea,
sitting up in bed, "because I dreamed all that as well as about the Zoo
and the rain; and Baby didn't know us in my dream, and the servants shut
us out of the house because the radiantness of our beauty was such a
complete disguise, and"----

The voice of the eldest brother sounded from across the landing.

"Come on, Robert," it said, "you'll be late for breakfast again--unless
you mean to shirk your bath as you did on Tuesday."

"I say, come here a second," Robert replied; "I didn't shirk it; I had
it after brekker in father's dressing-room because ours was emptied
away."

Cyril appeared in the doorway, partially clothed.

"Look here," said Anthea, "we've all had such an odd dream. We've all
dreamed we found a Sand-fairy."

Her voice died away before Cyril's contemptuous glance.

"Dream?" he said; "you little sillies, it's _true_. I tell you it all
happened. That's why I'm so keen on being down early. We'll go up there
directly after brekker, and have another wish. Only we'll make up our
minds, solid, before we go, what it is we do want, and no one must ask
for anything unless the others agree first. No more peerless beauties
for this child, thank you. Not if I know it!"

The other three dressed, with their mouths open. If all that dream about
the Sand-fairy was real, this real dressing seemed very like a dream,
the girls thought. Jane felt that Cyril was right, but Anthea was not
sure, till after they had seen Martha and heard her full and plain
reminders about their naughty conduct the day before. Then Anthea was
sure.

"Because," said she, "servants never dream anything but the things in
the Dream-book, like snakes and oysters and going to a wedding--that
means a funeral, and snakes are a false female friend, and oysters are
babies."

"Talking of babies," said Cyril, "where's the Lamb?"

"Martha's going to take him to Rochester to see her cousins. Mother said
she might. She's dressing him now," said Jane, "in his very best coat
and hat. Bread-and-butter, please."

"She seems to like taking him too," said Robert in a tone of wonder.

"Servants _do_ like taking babies to see their relations," Cyril said;
"I've noticed it before--especially in their best clothes."

"I expect they pretend they're their own babies, and that they're not
servants at all, but married to noble dukes of high degree, and they say
the babies are the little dukes and duchesses," Jane suggested dreamily,
taking more marmalade. "I expect that's what Martha'll say to her
cousin. She'll enjoy herself most frightfully."

"She won't enjoy herself most frightfully carrying our infant duke to
Rochester," said Robert; "not if she's anything like me--she won't."

"Fancy walking to Rochester with the Lamb on your back!" said Cyril in
full agreement.

"She's gone by the carrier's cart," said Jane. "Let's see them off, then
we shall have done a polite and kindly act, and we shall be quite sure
we've got rid of them for the day."

So they did.

Martha wore her Sunday dress of two shades of purple, so tight in the
chest that it made her stoop, and her blue hat with the pink
cornflowers and white ribbon. She had a yellow-lace collar with a green
bow. And the Lamb had indeed his very best cream-colored silk coat and
hat. It was a smart party that the carrier's cart picked up at the Cross
Roads. When its white tilt and red wheels had slowly vanished in a swirl
of chalk-dust--

"And now for the Sammyadd!" said Cyril, and off they went.

As they went they decided on the wish they would ask for. Although they
were all in a great hurry they did not try to climb down the sides of
the gravel-pit, but went round by the safe lower road, as if they had
been carts.

They had made a ring of stones round the place where the Sand-fairy had
disappeared, so they easily found the spot. The sun was burning and
bright, and the sky was deep blue--without a cloud. The sand was very
hot to touch.

"Oh--suppose it was only a dream, after all," Robert said as the boys
uncovered their spades from the sand-heap where they had buried them
and began to dig.

"Suppose you were a sensible chap," said Cyril; "one's quite as likely
as the other!"

"Suppose you kept a civil tongue in your head," Robert snapped.

"Suppose we girls take a turn," said Jane, laughing. "You boys seem to
be getting very warm."

"Suppose you don't come putting your silly oar in," said Robert, who was
now warm indeed.

"We won't," said Anthea quickly. "Robert dear, don't be so grumpy--we
won't say a word, you shall be the one to speak to the Fairy and tell
him what we've decided to wish for. You'll say it much better than we
shall."

"Suppose you drop being a little humbug," said Robert, but not crossly.
"Look out--dig with your hands, now!"

So they did, and presently uncovered the spider-shaped brown hairy body,
long arms and legs, bat's ears and snail's eyes of the Sand-fairy
himself. Everyone drew a deep breath of satisfaction, for now of course
it couldn't have been a dream.

The Psammead sat up and shook the sand out of its fur.

"How's your left whisker this morning?" said Anthea politely.

"Nothing to boast of," said it; "it had rather a restless night. But
thank you for asking."

"I say," said Robert, "do you feel up to giving wishes to-day, because
we very much want an extra besides the regular one? The extra's a very
little one," he added reassuringly.

"Humph!" said the Sand-fairy. (If you read this story aloud, please
pronounce "humph" exactly as it is spelt, for that is how he said it.)
"Humph! Do you know, until I heard you being disagreeable to each other
just over my head, and so loud too, I really quite thought I had dreamed
you all. I do have very odd dreams sometimes."

"Do you?" Jane hurried to say, so as to get away from the subject of
disagreeableness. "I wish," she added politely, "you'd tell us about
your dreams--they must be awfully interesting"--

"Is that the day's wish?" said the Sand-fairy, yawning.

Cyril muttered something about "just like a girl," and the rest stood
silent. If they said "Yes," then good-bye to the other wishes they had
decided to ask for. If they said "No," it would be very rude, and they
had all been taught manners, and had learned a little too, which is not
at all the same thing. A sigh of relief broke from all lips when the
Sand-fairy said--

"If I do, I shan't have strength to give you a second wish; not even
good tempers, or common-sense, or manners, or little things like that."

"We don't want you to put yourself out at all about _these_ things, we
can manage them quite well ourselves," said Cyril eagerly; while the
others looked guiltily at each other, and wished the Fairy would not
keep all on about good tempers, but give them one good scolding if it
wanted to, and then have done with it.

"Well," said the Psammead, putting out his long snail's eyes so suddenly
that one of them nearly went into the round boy's eye of Robert, "let's
have the little wish first."

"We don't want the servants to notice the gifts you give us."

"Are kind enough to give us," said Anthea in a whisper.

"Are kind enough to give us, I mean," said Robert.

The Fairy swelled himself out a bit, let his breath go, and said--

"I've done _that_ for you--it was quite easy. People don't notice things
much, anyway. What's the next wish?"

"We want," said Robert slowly, "to be rich beyond the dreams of
something or other."

"Avarice," said Jane.

"So it is," said the Fairy unexpectedly. "But it won't do you much good,
that's one comfort," it muttered to itself. "Come--I can't go beyond
dreams, you know! How much do you want, and will you have it in gold or
notes?"

"Gold, please--and millions of it"--

"This gravel-pit full be enough?" said the Fairy in an off-hand manner.

"Oh _yes_"--

"Then go out before I begin, or you'll be buried alive in it."

It made its skinny arms so long, and waved them so frighteningly, that
the children ran as hard as they could towards the road by which carts
used to come to the gravel-pits. Only Anthea had presence of mind enough
to shout a timid "Good-morning, I hope your whisker will be better
to-morrow," as she ran.

On the road they turned and looked back, and they had to shut their
eyes, and open them very slowly, a little bit at a time, because the
sight was too dazzling for their eyes to be able to bear. It was
something like trying to look at the sun at high noon on Midsummer Day.
For the whole of the sand-pit was full, right up to the very top, with
new shining gold pieces, and all the little bank-martins' little front
doors were covered out of sight. Where the road for carts wound into the
gravel-pit the gold lay in heaps like stones lie by the roadside, and a
great bank of shining gold shelved down from where it lay flat and
smooth between the tall sides of the gravel-pit. And all the gleaming
heaps was minted gold. And on the sides and edges of these countless
coins the mid-day sun shone and sparkled, and glowed and gleamed till
the quarry looked like the mouth of a smelting furnace, or one of the
fairy halls that you see sometimes in the sky at sunset.

The children stood with their mouths open, and no one said a word.

At last Robert stooped and picked up one of the loose coins from the
edge of the heap by the cart-road, and looked at it. He looked on both
sides. Then he said in a low voice, quite different to his own, "It's
not sovereigns."

"It's gold, anyway," said Cyril. And now they all began to talk at once.
They all picked up the golden treasure by handfuls and let it run
through their fingers like water, and the chink it made as it fell was
wonderful music. At first they quite forgot to think of spending the
money, it was so nice to play with. Jane sat down between two heaps of
the gold, and Robert began to bury her, as you bury your father in sand
when you are at the seaside and he has gone to sleep on the beach with
his newspaper over his face. But Jane was not half buried before she
cried out, "Oh stop, it's too heavy! It hurts!"

Robert said "Bosh!" and went on.

"Let me out, I tell you," cried Jane, and was taken out, very white, and
trembling a little.

"You've no idea what it's like," said she; "it's like stones on you--or
like chains."

"Look here," Cyril said, "if this is to do us any good, it's no good our
staying gasping at it like this. Let's fill our pockets and go and buy
things. Don't you forget, it won't last after sunset. I wish we'd asked
the Sammyadd why things don't turn to stone. Perhaps this will. I'll
tell you what, there's a pony and cart in the village."

"Do you want to buy that?" asked Jane.

"No, silly,--we'll _hire_ it. And then we'll go to Rochester and buy
heaps and heaps of things. Look here, let's each take as much as we can
carry. But it's not sovereigns. They've got a man's head on one side and
a thing like the ace of spades on the other. Fill your pockets with it,
I tell you, and come along. You can talk as we go--if you _must_ talk."

Cyril sat down and began to fill his pockets.

"You made fun of me for getting father to have nine pockets in my suit,"
said he, "but now you see!"

They did. For when Cyril had filled his nine pockets and his
handkerchief and the space between himself and his shirt front with the
gold coins, he had to stand up. But he staggered, and had to sit down
again in a hurry.

"Throw out some of the cargo," said Robert. "You'll sink the ship, old
chap. That comes of nine pockets."

And Cyril had to do so.

Then they set off to walk to the village. It was more than a mile, and
the road was very dusty indeed, and the sun seemed to get hotter and
hotter, and the gold in their pockets got heavier and heavier.

It was Jane who said, "I don't see how we're to spend it all. There must
be thousands of pounds among the lot of us. I'm going to leave some of
mine behind this stump in the hedge. And directly we get to the village
we'll buy some biscuits; I know it's long past dinner-time." She took
out a handful or two of gold and hid it in the hollows of an old
hornbeam. "How round and yellow they are," she said. "Don't you wish
they were made of gingerbread and we were going to eat them?"

"Well, they're not, and we're not," said Cyril. "Come on!"

But they came on heavily and wearily. Before they reached the village,
more than one stump in the hedge concealed its little hoard of hidden
treasure. Yet they reached the village with about twelve hundred guineas
in their pockets. But in spite of this inside wealth they looked
quite ordinary outside, and no one would have thought they could have
more than a half-crown each at the outside. The haze of heat, the blue
of the wood smoke, made a sort of dim misty cloud over the red roofs of
the village. The four sat down heavily on the first bench to which they
came. It happened to be outside the Blue Boar Inn.

[Illustration: He staggered, and had to sit down again in a hurry]

It was decided that Cyril should go into the Blue Boar and ask for
ginger-beer, because, as Anthea said, "It was not wrong for men to go
into beer-saloons, only for children. And Cyril is nearer being a man
than us, because he is the eldest." So he went. The others sat in the
sun and waited.

"Oh, how hot it is!" said Robert. "Dogs put their tongues out when
they're hot; I wonder if it would cool us at all to put out ours?"

"We might try," Jane said; and they all put their tongues out as far as
ever they could go, so that it quite stretched their throats, but it
only seemed to make them thirstier than ever, besides annoying everyone
who went by. So they took their tongues in again, just as Cyril came
back with ginger-beer.

"I had to pay for it out of my own money, though, that I was going to
buy rabbits with," he said. "They wouldn't change the gold. And when I
pulled out a handful the man just laughed and said it was card-counters.
And I got some sponge-cakes too, out of a glass jar on the bar-counter.
And some biscuits with caraways in."

The sponge-cakes were both soft and dry and the biscuits were dry too,
and yet soft, which biscuits ought not to be. But the ginger-beer made
up for everything.

"It's my turn now to try to buy something with the money," Anthea said;
"I'm next eldest. Where is the pony-cart kept?"

It was at The Chequers, and Anthea went in the back way to the yard,
because they all knew that little girls ought not to go into the bars of
beer-saloons. She came out, as she herself said, "pleased but not
proud."

"He'll be ready in a brace of shakes, he says," she remarked, "and he's
to have one sovereign--or whatever it is--to drive us into Rochester and
back, besides waiting there till we've got everything we want. I think I
managed very well."

"You think yourself jolly clever, I daresay," said Cyril moodily. "How
did you do it?"

"I wasn't jolly clever enough to go taking handfuls of money out of my
pocket, to make it seem cheap, anyway," she retorted. "I just found a
young man doing something to a horse's legs with a sponge and a pail.
And I held out one sovereign, and I said--'Do you know what this is?' He
said 'No,' and he'd call his father. And the old man came, and he said
it was a spade guinea; and he said was it my own to do as I liked with,
and I said 'Yes'; and I asked about the pony-cart, and I said he could
have the guinea if he'd drive us into Rochester. And his name is S.
Crispin. And he said, 'Right oh.'"

It was a new sensation to be driven in a smart pony-trap along pretty
country roads; it was very pleasant too (which is not always the case
with new sensations), quite apart from the beautiful plans of spending
the money which each child made as they went along, silently of course
and quite to itself, for they felt it would never have done to let the
old innkeeper hear them talk in the affluent sort of way in which they
were thinking. The old man put them down by the bridge at their request.

"If you were going to buy a carriage and horses, where would you go?"
asked Cyril, as if he were only asking for the sake of something to say.

"Billy Peasemarsh, at the Saracen's Head," said the old man promptly.
"Though all forbid I should recommend any man where it's a question of
horses, no more than I'd take anybody else's recommending if I was
a-buying one. But if your pa's thinking of a rig of any sort, there
ain't a straighter man in Rochester, nor civiller spoken, than Billy,
though I says it."

"Thank you," said Cyril. "The Saracen's Head."

And now the children began to see one of the laws of nature turn upside
down and stand on its head like an acrobat. Any grown-up person would
tell you that money is hard to get and easy to spend. But the fairy
money had been easy to get, and spending it was not only hard, it was
almost impossible. The trades-people of Rochester seemed to shrink, to a
trades-person, from the glittering fairy gold ("furrin money" they
called it, for the most part).

To begin with, Anthea, who had had the misfortune to sit on her hat
earlier in the day, wished to buy another. She chose a very beautiful
one, trimmed with pink roses and the blue breasts of peacocks. It was
marked in the window, "Paris Model, three guineas."

"I'm glad," she said, "because it says guineas, and not sovereigns,
which we haven't got."

But when she took three of the spade guineas in her hand, which was by
this time rather dirty owing to her not having put on gloves before
going to the gravel-pit, the black-silk young lady in the shop looked
very hard at her, and went and whispered something to an older and
uglier lady, also in black silk, and then they gave her back the money
and said it was not current coin.

"It's good money," said Anthea, "and it's my own."

"I daresay," said the lady, "but it's not the kind of money that's
fashionable now, and we don't care about taking it."

"I believe they think we've stolen it," said Anthea, rejoining the
others in the street; "if we had gloves they wouldn't think we were so
dishonest. It's my hands being so dirty fills their minds with doubts."

So they chose a humble shop, and the girls bought cotton gloves, the
kind at a shilling, but when they offered a guinea the woman looked at
it through her spectacles and said she had no change; so the gloves had
to be paid for out of Cyril's money with which he meant to buy rabbits
and so had the green imitation crocodile-skin purse at nine-pence which
had been bought at the same time. They tried several more shops, the
kinds where you buy toys and perfume and silk handkerchiefs and books,
and fancy boxes of stationery, and photographs of objects of interest in
the vicinity. But nobody cared to change a guinea that day in Rochester,
and as they went from shop to shop they got dirtier and dirtier, and
their hair got more and more untidy, and Jane slipped and fell down on a
part of the road where a water cart had just gone by. Also they got very
hungry, but they found no one would give them anything to eat for their
guineas.

After trying two baker shops in vain, they became so hungry, perhaps
from the smell of the cake in the shops, as Cyril suggested, that they
formed a plan of campaign in whispers and carried it out in desperation.
They marched into a third baker shop,--Beale was his name,--and before
the people behind the counter could interfere each child had seized
three new penny buns, clapped the three together between its dirty
hands, and taken a big bite out of the triple sandwich. Then they stood
at bay, with the twelve buns in their hands and their mouths very full
indeed. The shocked baker's man bounded round the corner.

"Here," said Cyril, speaking as distinctly as he could, and holding out
the guinea he got ready before entering the shops, "pay yourself out of
that."

Mr. Beale snatched the coin, bit it, and put it in his pocket.

[Illustration: Mr. Beale snatched the coin, bit it, and put it in his
pocket]

"Off you go," he said, brief and stern like the man in the song.

"But the change?" said Anthea, who had a saving mind.

"Change!" said the man, "I'll change you! Hout you goes; and you may
think yourselves lucky I don't send for the police to find out where you
got it!"

In the Gardens of the Castle the millionaires finished the buns, and
though the curranty softness of these were delicious, and acted like a
charm in raising the spirits of the party, yet even the stoutest heart
quailed at the thought of venturing to sound Mr. Billy Peasemarsh at the
Saracen's Head on the subject of a horse and carriage. The boys would
have given up the idea, but Jane was always a hopeful child, and Anthea
generally an obstinate one, and their earnestness prevailed.

The whole party, by this time indescribably dirty, therefore betook
itself to the Saracen's Head. The yard-method of attack having been
successful at The Chequers, was tried again here. Mr. Peasemarsh was in
the yard, and Robert opened the business in these terms--

"They tell me you have a lot of horses and carriages to sell." It had
been agreed that Robert should be spokesman, because in books it is
always gentlemen who buy horses, and not ladies, and Cyril had had his
go at the Blue Boar.

"They tell you true, young man," said Mr. Peasemarsh. He was a long lean
man, with very blue eyes and a tight mouth and narrow lips.

"We should like to buy some, please," said Robert politely.

"I daresay you would."

"Will you show us a few, please? To choose from."

"Who are you a-kiddin of?" inquired Mr. Billy Peasemarsh. "Was you sent
here of a message?"

"I tell you," said Robert, "we want to buy some horses and carriages,
and a man told us you were straight and civil spoken, but I shouldn't
wonder if he was mistaken"--

"Upon my sacred!" said Mr. Peasemarsh. "Shall I trot the whole stable
out for your Honor's worship to see? Or shall I send round to the
Bishop's to see if he's a nag or two to dispose of?"

"Please do," said Robert, "if it's not too much trouble. It would be
very kind of you."

Mr. Peasemarsh put his hands in his pockets and laughed, and they did
not like the way he did it. Then he shouted "Willum!"

A stooping ostler appeared in a stable door.

"Here, Willum, come and look at this 'ere young dook! Wants to buy the
whole stud, lock, stock, and bar'l. And ain't got tuppence in his
pocket to bless hisself with, I'll go bail!"

Willum's eyes followed his master's pointing thumb with contemptuous
interest.

"Do 'e, for sure?" he said.

But Robert spoke, though both the girls were now pulling at his jacket
and begging him to "come along." He spoke, and he was very angry; he
said--

"I'm not a young duke, and I never pretended to be. And as for
tuppence--what do you call this?" And before the others could stop him
he had pulled out two fat handfuls of shining guineas, and held them out
for Mr. Peasemarsh to look at. He did look. He snatched one up in his
finger and thumb. He bit it, and Jane expected him to say, "The best
horse in my stables is at your service." But the others knew better.
Still it was a blow, even to the most desponding, when he said shortly--

"Willum, shut the yard doors;" and Willum grinned and went to shut them.

"Good-afternoon," said Robert hastily; "we shan't buy any horses now,
whatever you say, and I hope it'll be a lesson to you." He had seen a
little side gate open, and was moving towards it as he spoke. But Billy
Peasemarsh put himself in the way.

"Not so fast, you young off-scouring!" he said. "Willum, fetch the
pleece."

Willum went. The children stood huddled together like frightened sheep,
and Mr. Peasemarsh spoke to them till the pleece arrived. He said many
things. Among other things he said--

"Nice lot you are, aren't you, coming tempting honest men with your
guineas!"

"They _are_ our guineas," said Cyril boldly.

"Oh, of course we don't know all about that, no more we don't--oh
no--course not! And dragging little gells into it, too. 'Ere--I'll let
the gells go if you'll come along to the pleece quiet."

"We won't be let go," said Jane heroically; "not without the boys. It's
our money just as much as theirs, you wicked old man."

"Where'd you get it, then?" said the man, softening slightly, which was
not at all what the boys expected when Jane began to call names.

Jane cast a silent glance of agony at the others.

"Lost your tongue, eh? Got it fast enough when it's for calling names
with. Come, speak up! Where'd you get it?"

"Out of the gravel-pit," said truthful Jane.

"Next article," said the man.

"I tell you we did," Jane said. "There's a fairy there--all over brown
fur--with ears like a bat's and eyes like a snail's, and he gives you a
wish a day, and they all come true."

"Touched in the head, eh?" said the man in a low voice; "all the more
shame to you boys dragging the poor afflicted child into your sinful
burglaries."

"She's not mad; it's true," said Anthea; "there _is_ a fairy. If I ever
see him again I'll wish for something for you; at least I would if
vengeance wasn't wicked--so there!"

"Lor' lumme," said Billy Peasemarsh, "if there ain't another on 'em!"

And now Willum came back, with a spiteful grin on his face, and at his
back a policeman, with whom Mr. Peasemarsh spoke long in a hoarse
earnest whisper.

"I daresay you're right," said the policeman at last. "Anyway, I'll take
'em up on a charge of unlawful possession, pending inquiries. And the
magistrate will deal with the case. Send the afflicted ones to a home,
as likely as not, and the boys to a reformatory. Now then, come along,
youngsters! No use making a fuss. You bring the gells along, Mr.
Peasemarsh, sir, and I'll shepherd the boys."

Speechless with rage and horror, the four children were driven along the
streets of Rochester. Tears of anger and shame blinded them, so that
when Robert ran right into a passer-by he did not recognise her till a
well-known voice said, "Well, if ever I did! Oh, Master Robert, whatever
have you been a-doing of now?" And another voice, quite as well known,
said, "Panty; want go own Panty!"

They had run into Martha and the Baby!

[Illustration: They had run into Martha and the baby]

Martha behaved admirably. She refused to believe a word of the
policeman's story, or of Mr. Peasemarsh's either, even when they made
Robert turn out his pockets in an archway and show the guineas.

"I don't see nothing," she said. "You've gone out of your senses, you
two! There ain't any gold there--only the poor child's hands, all over
dirt, and like the very chimbley. Oh that I should ever see the day!"

And the children thought this very noble of Martha, even if rather
wicked, till they remembered how the Fairy had promised that the
servants should never notice any of the fairy gifts. So of course Martha
couldn't see the gold, and so was only speaking the truth, and that was
quite right, of course, but not extra noble.

It was getting dusk when they reached the police-station. The policeman
told his tale to an inspector, who sat in a large bare room with a thing
like a clumsy nursery-fender at one end to put prisoners in. Robert
wondered whether it was a cell or a dock.

"Produce the coins, officer," said the inspector.

"Turn out your pockets," said the constable.

Cyril desperately plunged his hands in his pockets, stood still a
moment, and then began to laugh--an odd sort of laugh that hurt, and
that felt much more like crying. His pockets were empty. So were the
pockets of the others. For of course at sunset all the fairy gold had
vanished away.

"Turn out your pockets, and stop that noise," said the inspector.

Cyril turned out his pockets, every one of the nine which enriched his
suit. And every pocket was empty.

"Well!" said the inspector.

"I don't know how they done it--artful little beggars! They walked in
front of me the 'ole way, so as for me to keep my eye on them and not to
attract a crowd and obstruct the traffic."

"It's very remarkable," said the inspector, frowning.

"If you've done a-browbeating of the innocent children," said Martha,
"I'll hire a private carriage and we'll drive home to their papa's
mansion. You'll hear about this again, young man!--I told you they
hadn't got any gold, when you were pretending to see it in their poor
helpless hands. It's early in the day for a constable on duty not to be
able to trust his own eyes. As to the other one, the less said the
better; he keeps the Saracen's Head, and he knows best what his liquor's
like."

[Illustration: He said, "Now then!" to the policeman and Mr. Peasemarsh]

"Take them away, for goodness' sake," said the inspector crossly. But as
they left the police-station he said, "Now then!" to the policeman and
Mr. Peasemarsh, and he said it twenty times as crossly as he had spoken
to Martha.

       *       *       *       *       *

Martha was as good as her word. She took them home in a very grand
carriage, because the carrier's cart was gone, and, though she had stood
by them so nobly with the police, she was so angry with them as soon as
they were alone for "trapesing into Rochester by themselves," that none
of them dared to mention the old man with the pony-cart from the
village who was waiting for them in Rochester. And so, after one day of
boundless wealth, the children found themselves sent to bed in deep
disgrace, and only enriched by two pairs of cotton gloves, dirty inside
because of the state of the hands they had been put on to cover, an
imitation crocodile-skin purse, and twelve penny buns, long since
digested.

The thing that troubled them most was the fear that the old gentleman's
guinea might have disappeared at sunset with all the rest, so they went
down to the village next day to apologise for not meeting him in
Rochester, and to _see_. They found him very friendly. The guinea had
not disappeared, and he had bored a hole in it and hung it on his
watch-chain. As for the guinea the baker took, the children felt they
_could_ not care whether it had vanished or not, which was not perhaps
very honest, but on the other hand was not wholly unnatural. But
afterwards this preyed on Anthea's mind, and at last she secretly sent
twelve postage stamps by post to "Mr. Beale, Baker, Rochester." Inside
she wrote, "To pay for the buns." I hope the guinea did disappear, for
that baker was really not at all a nice man, and, besides, penny buns
are seven for sixpence in all really respectable shops.




CHAPTER III

BEING WANTED


The morning after the children had been the possessors of boundless
wealth, and had been unable to buy anything really useful or enjoyable
with it, except two pairs of cotton gloves, twelve penny buns, an
imitation crocodile-skin purse, and a ride in a pony-cart, they awoke
without any of the enthusiastic happiness which they had felt on the
previous day when they remembered how they had had the luck to find a
Psammead, or Sand-fairy, and to receive its promise to grant them a new
wish every day. For now they had had two wishes, Beauty and Wealth, and
neither had exactly made them happy. But the happening of strange
things, even if they are not completely pleasant things, is more amusing
than those times when nothing happens but meals, and they are not always
completely pleasant, especially on the days when it is cold mutton or
hash.

There was no chance of talking things over before breakfast, because
everyone overslept itself, as it happened, and it needed a vigorous and
determined struggle to get dressed so as to be only ten minutes late for
breakfast. During this meal some efforts were made to deal with the
question of the Psammead in an impartial spirit, but it is very
difficult to discuss anything thoroughly and at the same time to attend
faithfully to your baby brother's breakfast needs. The Baby was
particularly lively that morning. He not only wriggled his body through
the bar of his high chair, and hung by his head, choking and purple, but
he seized a tablespoon with desperate suddenness, hit Cyril heavily on
the head with it, and then cried because it was taken away from him. He
put his fat fist in his bread-and-milk, and demanded "nam," which was
only allowed for tea. He sang, he put his feet on the table--he
clamoured to "go walky." The conversation was something like this--

"Look here--about that Sand-fairy---- Look out!--he'll have the milk
over."

Milk removed to a safe distance.

"Yes--about that Fairy---- No, Lamb dear, give Panther the narky poon."

Then Cyril tried. "Nothing we've had yet has turned out---- He nearly
had the mustard that time!"

"I wonder whether we'd better wish---- Hullo!--you've done it now, my
boy!" And in a flash of glass and pink baby-paws, the bowl of golden
carp in the middle of the table rolled on its side and poured a flood of
mixed water and gold-fish into the Baby's lap and into the laps of the
others.

Everyone was almost as much upset as the gold-fish; the Lamb only
remaining calm. When the pool on the floor had been mopped up, and the
leaping, gasping gold-fish had been collected and put back in the water,
the Baby was taken away to be entirely re-dressed by Martha, and most of
the others had to change completely. The pinafores and jackets that had
been bathed in gold-fish-and-water were hung out to dry, and then it
turned out that Jane must either mend the dress she had torn the day
before or appear all day in her best petticoat. It was white and soft
and frilly, and trimmed with lace, and very, very pretty, quite as
pretty as a frock, if not more so. Only it was _not_ a frock, and
Martha's word was law. She wouldn't let Jane wear her best frock, and
she refused to listen for a moment to Robert's suggestion that Jane
should wear her best petticoat and call it a dress.

"It's not respectable," she said. And when people say that, it's no use
anyone's saying anything. You'll find this out for yourselves some day.

So there was nothing for it but for Jane to mend her frock. The hole had
been torn the day before when she happened to tumble down in the High
Street of Rochester, just where a water-cart had passed on its silvery
way. She had grazed her knee, and her stocking was much more than
grazed, and her dress was cut by the same stone which had attended to
the knee and the stocking. Of course the others were not such sneaks as
to abandon a comrade in misfortune, so they all sat on the grass-plot
round the sun-dial, and Jane darned away for dear life. The Lamb was
still in the hands of Martha having its clothes changed, so conversation
was possible.

Anthea and Robert timidly tried to conceal their inmost thought, which
was that the Psammead was not to be trusted; but Cyril said--

"Speak out--say what you've got to say--I hate hinting, and 'don't
know,' and sneakish ways like that."

So then Robert said, as in honour bound, "Sneak yourself--Anthea and me
weren't so gold-fishy as you two were, so we got changed quicker, and
we've had time to think it over, and if you ask me"--

"I didn't ask you," said Jane, biting off a needleful of thread as she
had always been strictly forbidden to do. (Perhaps you don't know that
if you bite off ends of cotton and swallow them they wind tight round
your heart and kill you? My nurse told me this, and she told me also
about the earth going round the sun. Now what is one to believe--what
with nurses and science?)

"I don't care who asks or who doesn't," said Robert, "but Anthea and I
think the Sammyadd is a spiteful brute. If it can give us our wishes I
suppose it can give itself its own, and I feel almost sure it wishes
every time that our wishes shan't do us any good. Let's let the tiresome
beast alone, and just go and have a jolly good game of forts, on our
own, in the chalk-pit."

(You will remember that the happily-situated house where these children
were spending their holidays lay between a chalk-quarry and a
gravel-pit.)

Cyril and Jane were more hopeful--they generally were.

"I don't think the Sammyadd does it on purpose," Cyril said; "and, after
all, it _was_ silly to wish for boundless wealth. Fifty pounds in
two-shilling pieces would have been much more sensible. And wishing to
be beautiful as the day was simply donkeyish. I don't want to be
disagreeable, but it _was_. We must try to find a really useful wish,
and wish it."

Jane dropped her work and said--

"I think so too, it's too silly to have a chance like this and not use
it. I never heard of anyone else outside a book who had such a chance;
there must be simply heaps of things we could wish for that wouldn't
turn out Dead Sea fish, like these two things have. Do let's think hard
and wish something nice, so that we can have a real jolly day--what
there is left of it."

Jane darned away again like mad, for time was indeed getting on, and
everyone began to talk at once. If you had been there you could not
possibly have made head or tail of the talk, but these children were
used to talking "by fours," as soldiers march, and each of them could
say what it had to say quite comfortably, and listen to the agreeable
sound of its own voice, and at the same time have three-quarters of two
sharp ears to spare for listening to what the others said. That is an
easy example in multiplication of vulgar fractions, but, as I daresay
you can't do even that, I won't ask you to tell me whether 3/4 × 2 =
1-1/2, but I will ask you to believe me that this was the amount of ear
each child was able to lend to the others. Lending ears was common in
Roman times, as we learn from Shakespeare; but I fear I am getting too
instructive.

When the frock was darned, the start for the gravel-pit was delayed by
Martha's insisting on everybody's washing its hands--which was nonsense,
because nobody had been doing anything at all, except Jane, and how can
you get dirty doing nothing? That is a difficult question, and I cannot
answer it on paper. In real life I could very soon show you--or you me,
which is much more likely.

During the conversation in which the six ears were lent (there were four
children, so _that_ sum comes right), it had been decided that fifty
pounds in two-shilling pieces was the right wish to have. And the lucky
children, who could have anything in the wide world by just wishing for
it, hurriedly started for the gravel-pit to express their wishes to the
Psammead. Martha caught them at the gate, and insisted on their taking
the Baby with them.

[Illustration: The lucky children ... hurriedly started for the gravel
pit]

"Not want him indeed! Why, everybody 'ud want him, a duck! with all
their hearts they would; and you know you promised your ma to take him
out every blessed day," said Martha.

"I know we did," said Robert in gloom, "but I wish the Lamb wasn't quite
so young and small. It would be much better fun taking him out."

"He'll mend of his youngness with time," said Martha; "and as for
smallness, I don't think you'd fancy carrying of him any more, however
big he was. Besides he can walk a bit, bless his precious fat legs, a
ducky! He feels the benefit of the new-laid air, so he does, a pet!"

With this and a kiss, she plumped the Lamb into Anthea's arms, and went
back to make new pinafores on the sewing-machine. She was a rapid
performer on this instrument.

The Lamb laughed with pleasure, and said, "Walky wif Panty," and rode on
Robert's back with yells of joy, and tried to feed Jane with stones,
and altogether made himself so agreeable that nobody could long be sorry
that he was of the party.

The enthusiastic Jane even suggested that they should devote a week's
wishes to assuring the Baby's future, by asking such gifts for him as
the good fairies give to Infant Princes in proper fairy-tales, but
Anthea soberly reminded her that as the Sand-fairy's wishes only lasted
till sunset they could not ensure any benefit to the Baby's later years;
and Jane owned that it would be better to wish for fifty pounds in
two-shilling pieces, and buy the Lamb a three-pound fifteen
rocking-horse, like those in the big stores, with a part of the money.

It was settled that, as soon as they had wished for the money and got
it, they would get Mr. Crispin to drive them into Rochester again,
taking Martha with them if they could not get out of taking her. And
they would make a list of things they really wanted before they started.
Full of high hopes and excellent resolutions, they went round the safe
slow cart-road to the gravel-pits, and as they went in between the
mounds of gravel a sudden thought came to them, and would have turned
their ruddy cheeks pale if they had been children in a book. Being real
live children, it only made them stop and look at each other with rather
blank and silly expressions. For now they remembered that yesterday,
when they had asked the Psammead for boundless wealth, and it was
getting ready to fill the quarry with the minted gold of bright
guineas--millions of them--it had told the children to run along outside
the quarry for fear they should be buried alive in the heavy splendid
treasure. And they had run. And so it happened that they had not had
time to mark the spot where the Psammead was, with a ring of stones, as
before. And it was this thought that put such silly expressions on their
faces.

"Never mind," said the hopeful Jane, "we'll soon find him."

But this, though easily said, was hard in the doing. They looked and
they looked, and, though they found their seaside spades, nowhere could
they find the Sand-fairy.

At last they had to sit down and rest--not at all because they were
weary or disheartened, of course, but because the Lamb insisted on being
put down, and you cannot look very carefully after anything you may have
happened to lose in the sand if you have an active baby to look after at
the same time. Get someone to drop your best knife in the sand next time
you go to the seashore and then take your baby brother with you when you
go to look for it, and you will see that I am right.

The Lamb, as Martha had said, was feeling the benefit of the country
air, and he was as frisky as a sandhopper. The elder ones longed to go
on talking about the new wishes they would have when (or if) they found
the Psammead again. But the Lamb wished to enjoy himself.

He watched his opportunity and threw a handful of sand into Anthea's
face, and then suddenly burrowed his own head in the sand and waved his
fat legs in the air. Then of course the sand got into his eyes, as it
had into Anthea's, and he howled.

The thoughtful Robert had brought one solid brown bottle of ginger-beer
with him, relying on a thirst that had never yet failed him. This had to
be uncorked hurriedly--it was the only wet thing within reach, and it
was necessary to wash the sand out of the Lamb's eyes somehow. Of course
the ginger hurt horribly, and he howled more than ever. And, amid his
anguish of kicking, the bottle was upset and the beautiful ginger-beer
frothed out into the sand and was lost for ever.

It was then that Robert, usually a very patient brother, so far forgot
himself as to say--

"Anybody would want him, indeed! Only they don't; Martha doesn't, not
really, or she'd jolly well keep him with her. He's a little nuisance,
that's what he is. It's too bad. I only wish everybody _did_ want him
with all their hearts; we might get some peace in our lives."

The Lamb stopped howling now, because Jane had suddenly remembered that
there is only one safe way of taking things out of little children's
eyes, and that is with your own soft wet tongue. It is quite easy if you
love the Baby as much as you ought to do.

Then there was a little silence. Robert was not proud of himself for
having been so cross, and the others were not proud of him either. You
often notice that sort of silence when someone has said something it
ought not to--and everyone else holds its tongue and waits for the one
who oughtn't to have said it is sorry.

The silence was broken by a sigh--a breath suddenly let out. The
children's heads turned as if there had been a string tied to each nose,
and somebody had pulled all the strings at once.

And everyone saw the Sand-fairy sitting quite close to them, with the
expression which it used as a smile on its hairy face.

"Good-morning," it said; "I did that quite easily! Everyone wants him
now."

"It doesn't matter," said Robert sulkily, because he knew he had been
behaving rather like a pig. "No matter who wants him--there's no one
here to--anyhow."

"Ingratitude," said the Psammead, "is a dreadful vice."

"We're not ungrateful," Jane made haste to say, "but we didn't _really_
want that wish. Robert only just said it. Can't you take it back and
give us a new one?"

"No--I can't," the Sand-fairy said shortly; "chopping and changing--it's
not business. You ought to be careful what you _do_ wish. There was a
little boy once, he'd wished for a Plesiosaurus instead of an
Ichthyosaurus, because he was too lazy to remember the easy names of
everyday things, and his father had been very vexed with him, and had
made him go to bed before tea-time, and wouldn't let him go out in the
nice flint boat along with the other children,--it was the annual
school-treat next day,--and he came and flung himself down near me on
the morning of the treat, and he kicked his little prehistoric legs
about and said he wished he was dead. And of course then he was."

"How awful! said the children all together.

"Only till sunset, of course," the Psammead said; "still it was quite
enough for his father and mother. And he caught it when he woke up--I
tell you. He didn't turn to stone--I forget why--but there must have
been some reason. They didn't know being dead is only being asleep, and
you're bound to wake up somewhere or other, either where you go to sleep
or in some better place. You may be sure he caught it, giving them such
a turn. Why, he wasn't allowed to taste Megatherium for a month after
that. Nothing but oysters and periwinkles, and common things like that."

All the children were quite crushed by this terrible tale. They looked
at the Psammead in horror. Suddenly the Lamb perceived that something
brown and furry was near him.

"Poof, poof, poofy," he said, and made a grab.

[Illustration: "Poof, poof, poofy," he said, and made a grab]

"It's not a pussy," Anthea was beginning, when the Sand-fairy leaped
back.

"Oh, my left whisker!" it said; "don't let him touch me. He's wet."

Its fur stood on end with horror--and indeed a good deal of the
ginger-beer had been spilt on the blue smock of the Lamb.

The Psammead dug with its hands and feet, and vanished in an instant and
a whirl of sand.

The children marked the spot with a ring of stones.

"We may as well get along home," said Robert. "I'll say I'm sorry; but
anyway if it's no good it's no harm, and we know where the sandy thing
is for to-morrow."

The others were noble. No one reproached Robert at all. Cyril picked up
the Lamb, who was now quite himself again, and off they went by the safe
cart-road.

The cart-road from the gravel-pits joins the road almost directly.

At the gate into the road the party stopped to shift the Lamb from
Cyril's back to Robert's. And as they paused a very smart open carriage
came in sight, with a coachman and a groom on the box, and inside the
carriage a lady--very grand indeed, with a dress all white lace and
red ribbons and a parasol all red and white--and a white fluffy dog on
her lap with a red ribbon round its neck. She looked at the children,
and particularly at the Baby, and she smiled at him. The children were
used to this, for the Lamb was, as all the servants said, a "very taking
child." So they waved their hands politely to the lady and expected her
to drive on. But she did not. Instead she made the coachman stop. And
she beckoned to Cyril, and when he went up to the carriage she said--

"What a dear darling duck of a baby! Oh, I _should_ so like to adopt it!
Do you think its mother would mind?"

"She'd mind very much indeed," said Anthea shortly.

"Oh, but I should bring it up in luxury, you know. I am Lady Chittenden.
You must have seen my photograph in the illustrated papers. They call me
a Beauty, you know, but of course that's all nonsense. Anyway"--

She opened the carriage door and jumped out. She had the wonderfullest
red high-heeled shoes with silver buckles. "Let me hold him a minute,"
she said. And she took the Lamb and held him very awkwardly, as if she
was not used to babies.

Then suddenly she jumped into the carriage with the Lamb in her arms and
slammed the door, and said, "Drive on!"

The Lamb roared, the little white dog barked, and the coachman
hesitated.

"Drive on, I tell you!" cried the lady; and the coachman did, for, as he
said afterwards, it was as much as his place was worth not to.

The four children looked at each other, and then with one accord they
rushed after the carriage and held on behind. Down the dusty road went
the smart carriage, and after it, at double-quick time, ran the
twinkling legs of the Lamb's brothers and sisters.

[Illustration: At double-quick time, ran the twinkling legs of the
Lamb's brothers and sisters]

The Lamb howled louder and louder, but presently his howls changed by
slow degrees to hiccupy gurgles, and then all was still, and they knew
he had gone to sleep.

The carriage went on, and the eight feet that twinkled through the
dust were growing quite stiff and tired before the carriage stopped at
the lodge of a grand park. The children crouched down behind the
carriage, and the lady got out. She looked at the Baby as it lay on the
carriage seat, and hesitated.

"The darling--I won't disturb it," she said, and went into the lodge to
talk to the woman there about a setting of eggs that had not turned out
well.

The coachman and footman sprang from the box and bent over the sleeping
Lamb.

"Fine boy--wish he was mine," said the coachman.

"He wouldn't favour _you_ much," said the groom sourly; "too 'andsome."

The coachman pretended not to hear. He said--

"Wonder at her now--I do really! Hates kids. Got none of her own, and
can't abide other folkses'."

The children, crouched in the white dust under the carriage, exchanged
uncomfortable glances.

"Tell you what," the coachman went on firmly, "blowed if I don't hide
the little nipper in the hedge and tell her his brothers took 'im! Then
I'll come back for him afterwards."

"No, you don't," said the footman. "I've took to that kid so as never
was. If anyone's to have him, it's me--so there!"

"Stop your talk!" the coachman rejoined. "You don't want no kids, and,
if you did, one kid's the same as another to you. But I'm a married man
and a judge of breed. I knows a firstrate yearling when I sees him. I'm
a-goin' to 'ave him, an' least said soonest mended."

"I should 'a' thought," said the footman sneeringly, "you'd a'most
enough. What with Alfred, an' Albert, an' Louise, an' Victor Stanley,
and Helena Beatrice, and another"--

The coachman hit the footman in the chin--the footman hit the coachman
in the waist-coat--the next minute the two were fighting here and there,
in and out, up and down, and all over everywhere, and the little dog
jumped on the box of the carriage and began barking like mad.

[Illustration: The next minute the two were fighting]

Cyril, still crouching in the dust, waddled on bent legs to the side of
the carriage farthest from the battlefield. He unfastened the door of
the carriage--the two men were far too much occupied with their quarrel
to notice anything--took the Lamb in his arms, and, still stooping,
carried the sleeping baby a dozen yards along the road to where a stile
led into a wood. The others followed, and there among the hazels and
young oaks and sweet chestnuts, covered by high strong-scented
brake-fern, they all lay hidden till the angry voices of the men were
hushed at the angry voice of the red-and-white lady, and, after a long
and anxious search, the carriage at last drove away.

"My only hat!" said Cyril, drawing a deep breath as the sound of wheels
at last died away. "Everyone _does_ want him now--and no mistake! That
Sammyadd has done us again! Tricky brute! For any sake, let's get the
kid safe home."

So they peeped out, and finding on the right hand only lonely white
road, and nothing but lonely white road on the left, they took courage,
and the road, Anthea carrying the sleeping Lamb.

Adventures dogged their footsteps. A boy with a bundle of faggots on his
back dropped his bundle by the roadside and asked to look at the Baby,
and then offered to carry him; but Anthea was not to be caught that way
twice. They all walked on, but the boy followed, and Cyril and Robert
couldn't make him go away till they had more than once invited him to
smell their fists. Afterwards a little girl in a blue-and-white checked
pinafore actually followed them for a quarter of a mile crying for "the
precious Baby," and then she was only got rid of by threats of tying her
to a tree in the wood with all their pocket handkerchiefs. "So that
bears can come and eat you as soon as it gets dark," said Cyril
severely. Then she went off crying. It presently seemed wise, to the
brothers and sisters of the Baby who was wanted by everyone, to hide in
the hedge whenever they saw anyone coming, and thus they managed to
prevent the Lamb from arousing the inconvenient affection of a milkman,
a stone-breaker, and a man who drove a cart with a paraffin barrel at
the back of it. They were nearly home when the worst thing of all
happened. Turning a corner suddenly they came upon two vans, a tent, and
a company of gipsies encamped by the side of the road. The vans were
hung all round with wicker chairs and cradles, and flower-stands and
feather brushes. A lot of ragged children were industriously making
dust-pies in the road, two men lay on the grass smoking, and three women
were doing the family washing in an old red watering-can with the top
broken off.

In a moment every gipsy, men, women, and children, surrounded Anthea and
the Baby.

"Let me hold him, little lady," said one of the gipsy women, who had a
mahogany-coloured face and dust-coloured hair; "I won't hurt a hair of
his head, the little picture!"

"I'd rather not," said Anthea.

"Let _me_ have him," said the other woman, whose face was also of the
hue of mahogany, and her hair jet-black, in greasy curls. "I've nineteen
of my own, so I have"--

"No," said Anthea bravely, but her heart beat so that it nearly choked
her.

Then one of the men pushed forward.

"Swelp me if it ain't!" he cried, "my own long-lost cheild! Have he a
strawberry mark on his left ear? No? Then he's my own babby, stolen from
me in hinnocent hinfancy. 'And 'im over--and we'll not 'ave the law on
yer this time."

He snatched the Baby from Anthea, who turned scarlet and burst into
tears of pure rage.

[Illustration: He snatched the baby from Anthea]

The others were standing quite still; this was much the most terrible
thing that had ever happened to them. Even being taken up by the police
in Rochester was nothing to this. Cyril was quite white, and his hands
trembled a little, but he made a sign to the others to shut up. He was
silent a minute, thinking hard. Then he said--

"We don't want to keep him if he's yours. But you see he's used to us.
You shall have him if you want him"--

"No, no!" cried Anthea,--and Cyril glared at her.

"Of course we want him," said the women, trying to get the Baby out of
the man's arms. The Lamb howled loudly.

"Oh, he's hurt!" shrieked Anthea; and Cyril, in a savage undertone, bade
her "stop it!"

"You trust to me," he whispered. "Look here," he went on, "he's awfully
tiresome with people he doesn't know very well. Suppose we stay here a
bit till he gets used to you, and then when it's bedtime I give you my
word of honour we'll go away and let you keep him if you want to. And
then when we're gone you can decide which of you is to have him, as you
all want him so much."

"That's fair enough," said the man who was holding the Baby, trying to
loosen the red neckerchief which the Lamb had caught hold of and drawn
round his mahogany throat so tight that he could hardly breathe. The
gipsies whispered together, and Cyril took the chance to whisper too. He
said, "Sunset! we'll get away then."

And then his brothers and sisters were filled with wonder and admiration
at his having been so clever as to remember this.

"Oh, do let him come to us!" said Jane. "See, we'll sit down here and
take care of him for you till he gets used to you."

"What about dinner?" said Robert suddenly. The others looked at him with
scorn. "Fancy bothering about your beastly dinner when your br--I mean
when the Baby"--Jane whispered hotly. Robert carefully winked at her and
went on--

"You won't mind my just running home to get our dinner?" he said to the
gipsy; "I can bring it out here in a basket."

His brothers and sisters felt themselves very noble and despised him.
They did not know his thoughtful secret intention. But the gipsies did
in a minute.

"Oh yes!" they said; "and then fetch the police with a pack of lies
about it being your baby instead of ours! D'jever catch a weasel
asleep?" they asked.

"If you're hungry you can pick a bit along of us," said the light-haired
gipsy-woman, not unkindly. "Here Levi, that blessed kid'll howl all his
buttons off. Give him to the little lady, and let's see if they can't
get him used to us a bit."

So the Lamb was handed back; but the gipsies crowded so closely that he
could not possibly stop howling. Then the man with the red handkerchief
said--

"Here, Pharaoh, make up the fire; and you girls see to the pot. Give the
kid a chanst." So the gipsies, very much against their will, went off to
their work, and the children and the Lamb were left sitting on the
grass.

"He'll be all right at sunset," Jane whispered. "But, oh, it is awful!
Suppose they are frightfully angry when they come to their senses! They
might beat us, or leave us tied to trees, or something."

"No, they won't," Anthea said ("Oh, my Lamb, don't cry any more, it's
all right, Panty's got oo, duckie"); "they aren't unkind people, or they
wouldn't be going to give us any dinner."

"Dinner?" said Robert; "I won't touch their nasty dinner. It would choke
me!"

The others thought so too then. But when the dinner was ready--it turned
out to be supper, and happened between four and five--they were all glad
enough to take what they could get. It was boiled rabbit, with onions,
and some bird rather like a chicken, but stringier about its legs and
with a stronger taste. The Lamb had bread soaked in hot water and brown
sugar sprinkled on the top. He liked this very much, and consented to
let the two gipsy women feed him with it, as he sat on Anthea's lap. All
that long hot afternoon Robert and Cyril and Anthea and Jane had to keep
the Lamb amused and happy, while the gipsies looked eagerly on. By the
time the shadows grew long and black across the meadows he had really
"taken to" the woman with the light hair, and even consented to kiss
his hand to the children, and to stand up and bow, with his hand on his
chest--"like a gentleman"--to the two men. The whole gipsy camp was in
raptures with him, and his brothers and sisters could not help taking
some pleasure in showing off his accomplishments to an audience so
interested and enthusiastic. But they longed for sunset.

[Illustration: He consented to let the two gypsy women feed him]

"We're getting into the habit of longing for sunset," Cyril whispered.
"How I do wish we could wish something really sensible, that would be of
some use, so that we should be quite sorry when sunset came."

The shadows got longer and longer, and at last there were no separate
shadows any more, but one soft glowing shadow over everything; for the
sun was out of sight--behind the hill--but he had not really set yet.
The people who make the laws about lighting bicycle lamps are the people
who decide when the sun sets; she has to do it too, to the minute, or
they would know the reason why!

But the gipsies were getting impatient.

"Now, young uns," the red-handkerchief man said, "it's time you were
laying of your heads on your pillowses--so it is! The kid's all right
and friendly with us now--so you just hand him over and get home like
you said."

The women and children came crowding round the Lamb, arms were held out,
fingers snapped invitingly, friendly faces beaming with admiring smiles;
but all failed to tempt the loyal Lamb. He clung with arms and legs to
Jane, who happened to be holding him, and uttered the gloomiest roar of
the whole day.

"It's no good," the woman said, "hand the little poppet over, miss.
We'll soon quiet him."

And still the sun would not set.

"Tell her about how to put him to bed," whispered Cyril; "anything to
gain time--and be ready to bolt when the sun really does make up its
silly old mind to set."

"Yes, I'll hand him over in just one minute," Anthea began, talking very
fast,--"but do let me just tell you he has a warm bath every night and
cold in the morning, and he has a crockery rabbit to go into the warm
bath with him, and little Samuel saying his prayers in white china on a
red cushion for the cold bath; and he hates you to wash his ears, but
you must; and if you let the soap get into his eyes, the Lamb"--

"Lamb kyes," said he--he had stopped roaring to listen.

The woman laughed. "As if I hadn't never bath'd a babby!" she said.
"Come--give us a hold of him. Come to 'Melia, my precious"--

"G'way, ugsie!" replied the Lamb at once.

"Yes, but," Anthea went on, "about his meals; you really _must_ let me
tell you he has an apple or banana every morning, and bread and milk for
breakfast, and an egg for his tea sometimes, and"--

"I've brought up ten," said the black ringleted woman, "besides the
others. Come, miss, 'and 'im over--I can't bear it no longer. I just
must give him a hug."

"We ain't settled yet whose he's to be, Esther," said one of the men.

"It won't be you, Esther, with seven of 'em at your tail a'ready."

"I ain't so sure of that," said Esther's husband.

"And ain't I nobody, to have a say neither?" said the husband of 'Melia.

Zillah, the girl, said, "An' me? I'm a single girl--and no one but 'im
to look after--I ought to have him."

"Hold your tongue!"

"Shut your mouth!"

"Don't you show me no more of your imperence!"

Everyone was getting very angry. The dark gipsy faces were frowning and
anxious-looking. Suddenly a change swept over them, as if some invisible
sponge had wiped away these cross and anxious expressions, and left only
a blank.

The children saw that the sun really _had_ set. But they were afraid to
move. And the gipsies were feeling so muddled because of the invisible
sponge that had washed all the feelings of the last few hours out of
their hearts, that they could not say a word.

The children hardly dared to breathe. Suppose the gipsies, when they
recovered speech, should be furious to think how silly they had been all
day?

It was an awkward moment. Suddenly Anthea, greatly daring, held out the
Lamb to the red-handkerchief man.

"Here he is!" she said.

The man drew back. "I shouldn't like to deprive you, miss," he said
hoarsely.

"Anyone who likes can have my share of him," said the other man.

"After all, I've got enough of my own," said Esther.

"He's a nice little chap, though," said Amelia. She was the only one who
now looked affectionately at the whimpering Lamb.

Zillah said, "If I don't think I must have had a touch of the sun. _I_
don't want him."

"Then shall we take him away?" said Anthea.

"Well--suppose you do," said Pharaoh heartily, "and we'll say no more
about it!"

And with great haste all the gipsies began to be busy about their tents
for the night. All but Amelia. She went with the children as far as the
bend in the road--and there she said--

"Let me give him a kiss, miss,--I don't know what made us go for to
behave so silly. Us gipsies don't steal babies, whatever they may tell
you when you're naughty. We've enough of our own, mostly. But I've lost
all mine."

She leaned towards the Lamb; and he, looking in her eyes, unexpectedly
put up a grubby soft paw and stroked her face.

"Poor, poor!" said the Lamb. And he let the gipsy woman kiss him, and,
what is more, he kissed her brown cheek in return--a very nice kiss, as
all his kisses are, and not a wet one like some babies give. The gipsy
woman moved her finger about on his forehead as if she had been writing
something there, and the same with his chest and his hands and his
feet; then she said--

"May he be brave, and have the strong head to think with, and the strong
heart to love with, and the strong arms to work with, and the strong
feet to travel with, and always come safe home to his own." Then she
said something in a strange language no one could understand, and
suddenly added--

"Well, I must be saying 'so long'--and glad to have made your
acquaintance." And she turned and went back to her home--the tent by the
grassy roadside.

The children looked after her till she was out of sight. Then Robert
said, "How silly of her! Even sunset didn't put _her_ right. What rot
she talked!"

"Well," said Cyril, "if you ask me, I think it was rather decent of
her"--

"Decent?" said Anthea; "it was very nice indeed of her. I think she's a
dear"--

"She's just too frightfully nice for anything," said Jane.

And they went home--very late for tea and unspeakably late for dinner.
Martha scolded, of course. But the Lamb was safe.

"I say--it turned out we wanted the Lamb as much as anyone," said
Robert, later.

"Of course."

"But do you feel different about it now the sun's set?"

"_No_," said all the others together.

"Then it's lasted over sunset with us."

"No, it hasn't," Cyril explained. "The wish didn't do anything to _us_.
We always wanted him with all our hearts when we were our proper selves,
only we were all pigs this morning; especially you, Robert." Robert bore
this much with a strange calm.

"I certainly _thought_ I didn't want him this morning," said he.
"Perhaps I _was_ a pig. But everything looked so different when we
thought we were going to lose him."

And that, my dear children, is the moral of this chapter. I did not mean
it to have a moral, but morals are nasty forward beings, and will keep
putting in their oars where they are not wanted. And since the moral has
crept in, quite against my wishes, you might as well think of it next
time you feel piggy yourself and want to get rid of any of your brothers
and sisters. I hope this doesn't often happen, but I daresay it has
happened sometimes, even to you!




CHAPTER IV

WINGS


The next day was very wet--too wet to go out, and far too wet to think
of disturbing a Sand-fairy so sensitive to water that he still, after
thousands of years, felt the pain of once having his left whisker
wetted. It was a long day, and it was not till the afternoon that all
the children suddenly decided to write letters to their mother. It was
Robert who had the misfortune to upset the ink well--an unusually deep
and full one--straight into that part of Anthea's desk where she had
long pretended that an arrangement of mucilage and cardboard painted
with Indian ink was a secret drawer. It was not exactly Robert's fault;
it was only his misfortune that he chanced to be lifting the ink across
the desk just at the moment when Anthea had got it open, and that that
same moment should have been the one chosen by the Lamb to get under
the table and break his squeaking bird. There was a sharp convenient
wire inside the bird, and of course the Lamb ran the wire into Robert's
leg at once; and so, without anyone's meaning to do it the secret drawer
was flooded with ink. At the same time a stream was poured over Anthea's
half-finished letter.

So that her letter was something like this--

          "DARLING MOTHER,--I hope you are quite well, and I
          hope Granny is better. The other day we...."

Then came a flood of ink, and at the bottom these words in pencil--

          "It was not me upset the ink, but it took such a
          time clearing up, so no more as it is
          post-time.--From your loving daughter     "ANTHEA."

Robert's letter had not even been begun. He had been drawing a ship on
the blotting paper while he was trying to think of what to say. And of
course after the ink was upset he had to help Anthea to clean out her
desk, and he promised to make her another secret drawer, better than
the other. And she said, "Well, make it now." So it was post-time and
his letter wasn't done. And the secret drawer wasn't done either.

Cyril wrote a long letter, very fast, and then went to set a trap for
slugs that he had read about in the _Home-made Gardener_, and when it
was post-time the letter could not be found, and it was never found.
Perhaps the slugs ate it.

Jane's letter was the only one that went. She meant to tell her mother
all about the Psammead,--in fact they had all meant to do this,--but she
spent so long thinking how to spell the word that there was no time to
tell the story properly, and it is useless to tell a story unless you
_do_ tell it properly, so she had to be contented with this--

          "MY DEAR MOTHER DEAR,--We are all as good as we
          can, like you told us to, and the Lamb has a
          little cold, but Martha says it is nothing, only
          he upset the gold-fish into himself yesterday
          morning. When we were up at the sand-pit the other
          day we went round by the safe way where carts go,
          and we found  a"--

Half an hour went by before Jane felt quite sure that they could none of
them spell Psammead. And they could not find it in the dictionary
either, though they looked. Then Jane hastily finished her letter--

          "We found a strange thing, but it is nearly
          post-time, so no more at present from your little
          girl,

                                                   "JANE.

          "P.S.--If you could have a wish come true what
          would you have?"

Then the postman was heard blowing his horn, and Robert rushed out in
the rain to stop his cart and give him the letters. And that was how it
happened that, though all the children meant to tell their mother about
the Sand-fairy, somehow or other she never got to know. There were other
reasons why she never got to know, but these come later.

The next day Uncle Richard came and took them all to Maidstone in a
wagonette--all except the Lamb. Uncle Richard was the very best kind of
uncle. He bought them toys at Maidstone. He took them into a shop and
let them all choose exactly what they wanted, without any restrictions
about price, and no nonsense about things being instructive. It is very
wise to let children choose exactly what they like, because they are
very foolish and inexperienced, and sometimes they will choose a really
instructive thing without meaning to do so. This happened to Robert, who
chose, at the last moment, and in a great hurry, a box with pictures on
it of winged bulls with men's heads and winged men with eagles' heads.
He thought there would be animals inside, the same as on the box. When
he got it home it was a Sunday puzzle about ancient Nineveh! The others
chose in haste, and were happy at leisure. Cyril had a model engine, and
the girls had two dolls, as well as a china tea-set with forget-me-nots
on it, to be "between them." The boys' "between them" was bow and arrow.

Then Uncle Richard took them on the beautiful Medway in a boat, and then
they all had tea at a beautiful confectioner's and when they reached
home it was far too late to have any wishes that day.

They did not tell Uncle Richard anything about the Psammead. I do not
know why. And they do not know why. But I daresay you can guess.

The day after Uncle Richard had behaved so handsomely was a very hot day
indeed. The people who decide what the weather is to be, and put its
orders down for it in the newspapers every morning, said afterwards that
it was the hottest day there had been for years. They had ordered it to
be "warmer--some showers," and warmer it certainly was. In fact it was
so busy being warmer that it had no time to attend to the order about
showers, so there weren't any.

Have you ever been up at five o'clock on a fine summer morning? It is
very beautiful. The sunlight is pinky and yellowy, and all the grass and
trees are covered with dew-diamonds. And all the shadows go the opposite
way to the way they do in the evening, which is very interesting and
makes you feel as though you were in a new other world.

Anthea woke at five. She had made herself wake, and I must tell you how
it is done, even if it keeps you waiting for the story to go on.

You get into bed at night, and lie down quite flat on your little back,
with your hands straight down by your sides. Then you say "I _must_ wake
up at five" (or six, or seven, or eight, or nine, or whatever the time
is that you want), and as you say it you push your chin down on your
chest and then whack your head back on the pillow. And you do this as
many times as there are ones in the time you want to wake up at. (It is
quite an easy sum.) Of course everything depends on your really wanting
to get up at five (or six, or seven, or eight, or nine); if you don't
really want to, it's all of no use. But if you do--well, try it and see.
Of course in this, as in doing Latin proses or getting into mischief,
practice makes perfect.

Anthea was quite perfect.

At the very moment when she opened her eyes she heard the black-and-gold
clock down in the dining-room strike eleven. So she knew it was three
minutes to five. The black-and-gold clock always struck wrong, but it
was all right when you knew what it meant. It was like a person talking
a foreign language. If you know the language it is just as easy to
understand as English. And Anthea knew the clock language. She was very
sleepy, but she jumped out of bed and put her face and hands into a
basin of cold water. This is a fairy charm that prevents your wanting to
get back into bed again. Then she dressed, and folded up her night
dress. She did not tumble it together by the sleeves, but folded it by
the seams from the hem, and that will show you the kind of
well-brought-up little girl she was.

Then she took her shoes in her hand and crept softly down the stairs.
She opened the dining-room window and climbed out. It would have been
just as easy to go out by the door, but the window was more romantic,
and less likely to be noticed by Martha.

"I will always get up at five," she said to herself. "It was quite too
awfully pretty for anything."

Her heart was beating very fast, for she was carrying out a plan quite
her own. She could not be sure that it was a good plan, but she was
quite sure that it would not be any better if she were to tell the
others about it. And she had a feeling that, right or wrong, she would
rather go through with it alone. She put on her shoes under the iron
verandah, on the red-and-yellow shining tiles, and then she ran straight
to the sand-pit, and found the Psammead's place, and dug it out; it was
very cross indeed.

"It's too bad," it said, fluffing up its fur as pigeons do their
feathers at Christmas time. "The weather's arctic, and it's the middle
of the night."

"I'm so sorry," said Anthea gently, and she took off her white pinafore
and covered the Sand-fairy up with it, all but its head, its bat's ears,
and its eyes that were like a snail's eyes.

"Thank you," it said, "that's better. What's the wish this morning?"

"I don't know," she said; "that's just it. You see we've been very
unlucky, so far. I wanted to talk to you about it. But--would you mind
not giving me any wishes till after breakfast? It's so hard to talk to
anyone if they jump out at you with wishes you don't really want!"

"You shouldn't say you wish for things if you don't wish for them. In
the old days people almost always knew whether it was Megatherium or
Ichthyosaurus they really wanted for dinner."

"I'll try not to do so," said Anthea, "but I do wish"--

"Look out!" said the Psammead in a warning voice, and it began to blow
itself out.

"Oh, this isn't a magic wish--it's just--I should be so glad if you'd
not swell yourself out and nearly burst to give me anything just now.
Wait till the others are here."

"Well, well," it said indulgently, but it shivered.

"Would you," asked Anthea kindly--"would you like to come and sit on my
lap? You'd be warmer, and I could turn the skirt of my frock up around
you. I'd be very careful."

Anthea had never expected that it would, but it did.

"Thank you," it said; "you really are rather thoughtful." It crept on to
her lap and snuggled down, and she put her arms round it with a rather
frightened gentleness. "Now then!" it said.

"Well then," said Anthea, "everything we have wished has turned out
rather horrid. I wish you would advise us. You are so old, you must be
very wise."

"I was always generous from a child," said the Sand-fairy. "I've spent
the whole of my waking hours in giving. But one thing I won't
give--that's advice."

"You see," Anthea went on, "it's such a wonderful thing--such a
splendid, glorious chance. It's so good and kind and dear of you to give
us our wishes, and it seems such a pity it should all be wasted just
because we are too silly to know what to wish for."

Anthea had meant to say that--and she had not wanted to say it before
the others. It's one thing to say you're silly, and quite another to
say that other people are.

"Child," said the Sand-fairy sleepily, "I can only advise you to think
before you speak"--

"But I thought you never gave advice."

"That piece doesn't count," it said. "You'll never take it! Besides,
it's not original. It's in all the copy-books."

"But won't you just say if you think wings would be a silly wish?"

"Wings?" it said. "I should think you might do worse. Only, take care
you aren't flying high at sunset. There was a little Ninevite boy I
heard of once. He was one of King Sennacherib's sons, and a traveller
brought him a Psammead. He used to keep it in a box of sand on the
palace terrace. It was a dreadful degradation for one of us, of course;
still the boy _was_ the Assyrian King's son. And one day he wished for
wings and got them. But he forgot that they would turn into stone at
sunset, and when they did he fell on to one of the winged lions at the
top of his father's great staircase; and what with _his_ stone wings
and the lion's stone wings--well it's not a very pretty story! But I
believe the boy enjoyed himself very much till then."

"Tell me," said Anthea, "why don't our wishes turn into stone now? Why
do they just vanish?"

"_Autre temps autres moeurs_," said the creature.

"Is that the Ninevite language?" asked Anthea, who had learned no
foreign language at school except French.

"What I mean is," the Psammead went on, "that in the old days people
wished for good solid everyday gifts,--Mammoths and Pterodactyls and
things,--and those could be turned into stone as easy as not. But people
wish such high-flying fanciful things nowadays. How are you going to
turn being beautiful as the day, or being wanted by everybody, into
stone? You see it can't be done. And it would never do to have two
rules, so they simply vanish. If being beautiful as the day _could_ be
turned into stone it would last an awfully long time, you know--much
longer than you would. Just look at the Greek statues. It's just as
well as it is. Good-bye. I _am_ so sleepy."

It jumped off her lap--dug frantically, and vanished.

Anthea was late for breakfast. It was Robert who quietly poured a
spoonful of molasses down the Lamb's frock, so that he had to be taken
away and washed thoroughly directly after breakfast. And it was of
course a very naughty thing to do; yet it served two purposes--it
delighted the Lamb, who loved above all things to be completely sticky,
and it engaged Martha's attention so that the others could slip away to
the sand-pit without the Lamb.

They did it, and in the lane Anthea, breathless from the hurry of that
slipping, panted out--

"I want to propose we take turns to wish. Only, nobody's to have a wish
if the others don't think it's a nice wish. Do you agree?"

"Who's to have first wish?" asked Robert cautiously.

"Me, if you don't mind," said Anthea apologetically. "And I've thought
about it--and it's _wings_."

There was a silence. The others rather wanted to find fault, but it was
hard, because the word "wings" raised a flutter of joyous excitement in
every breast.

"Not so dusty," said Cyril generously; and Robert added, "Really,
Panther, you're not quite such a fool as you look."

Jane said, "I think it would be perfectly lovely. It's like a bright
dream of delirium."

They found the Sand-fairy easily. Anthea said--

"I wish we all had beautiful wings to fly with."

The Sand-fairy blew himself out, and next moment each child felt a funny
feeling, half heaviness and half lightness, on its shoulders. The
Psammead put its head on one side and turned its snail eyes from one
side to the other.

[Illustration: The Sand-fairy blew himself out]

"Not so bad," it said dreamily. "But really, Robert, you're not quite
such an angel as you look." Robert almost blushed.

The wings were very big, and more beautiful than you can possibly
imagine--for they were soft and smooth, and every feather lay neatly in
its place. And the feathers were of the most lovely mixed changing
colors, like the rainbow, or iridescent glass, or the beautiful scum
that sometimes floats on water that is not at all nice to drink.

"Oh--but how can we fly?" Jane said, standing anxiously first on one
foot and then on the other.

"Look out!" said Cyril; "you're treading on my wing."

"Does it hurt?" asked Anthea with interest; but no one answered, for
Robert had spread his wings and jumped up, and now he was slowly rising
in the air. He looked very awkward in his knickerbocker suit--his boots
in particular hung helplessly, and seemed much larger than when he was
standing in them. But the others cared but little how he looked,--or how
they looked, for that matter. For now they all spread out their wings
and rose in the air. Of course you all know what flying feels like,
because everyone has dreamed about flying, and is seems so beautifully
easy--only, you can never remember how you did it; and as a rule you
have to do it without wings, in your dreams, which is more clever and
uncommon, but not so easy to remember the rule for. Now the four
children rose flapping from the ground, and you can't think how good the
air felt as it ran against their faces. Their wings were tremendously
wide when they were spread out, and they had to fly quite a long way
apart so as not to get in each other's way. But little things like this
are easily learned.

All the words in the English Dictionary, and in the Greek Lexicon as
well, are, I find, of no use at all to tell you exactly what it feels
like to be flying, so I will not try. But I will say that to look _down_
on the fields and woods instead of _along_ at them, is something like
looking at a beautiful live map, where, instead of silly colors on
paper, you have real moving sunny woods and green fields laid out one
after the other. As Cyril said, and I can't think where he got hold of
such a strange expression, "It does you a fair treat!" It was most
wonderful and more like real magic than any wish the children had had
yet. They flapped and flew and sailed on their great rainbow wings,
between green earth and blue sky; and they flew over Rochester and then
swerved round towards Maidstone, and presently they all began to feel
extremely hungry. Curiously enough, this happened when they were flying
rather low, and just as they were crossing an orchard where some early
plums shone red and ripe.

[Illustration: They flew over Rochester]

They paused on their wings. I cannot explain to you how this is done,
but it is something like treading water when you are swimming, and hawks
do it extremely well.

"Yes, I daresay," said Cyril, though no one had spoken. "But stealing is
stealing even if you've got wings."

"Do you really think so?" said Jane briskly. "If you've got wings you're
a bird, and no one minds birds breaking the commandments. At least,
they may _mind_, but the birds always do it, and no one scolds them or
sends them to prison."

It was not so easy to perch on a plum-tree as you might think, because
the rainbow wings were so _very_ large; but somehow they all managed to
do it, and the plums were certainly very sweet and juicy.

Fortunately, it was not till they had all had quite as many plums as
were good for them that they saw a stout man, who looked exactly as
though he owned the plum-trees, come hurrying through the orchard gate
with a thick stick, and with one accord they disentangled their wings
from the plum-laden branches and began to fly.

The man stopped short, with his mouth open. For he had seen the boughs
of his trees moving and twitching, and he had said to himself, "Them
young varmint--at it again!" And he had come out at once, for the lads
of the village had taught him in past seasons that plums want looking
after. But when he saw the rainbow wings flutter up out of the
plum-tree he felt that he must have gone quite mad, and he did not like
the feeling at all. And when Anthea looked down and saw his mouth go
slowly open, and stay so, and his face become green and mauve in
patches, she called out--

"Don't be frightened," and felt hastily in her pocket for a
threepenny-bit with a hole in it, which she had meant to hang on a
ribbon round her neck, for luck. She hovered round the unfortunate
plum-owner, and said, "We have had some of your plums; we thought it
wasn't stealing, but now I am not so sure. So here's some money to pay
for them."

She swooped down toward the terror-stricken grower of plums, and slipped
the coin into the pocket of his jacket, and in a few flaps she had
rejoined the others.

The farmer sat down on the grass, suddenly and heavily.

[Illustration: The farmer sat down on the grass suddenly and heavily]

"Well--I'm blessed!" he said. "This here is what they call delusions, I
suppose. But this here threepenny"--he had pulled it out and bitten
it,--"_that's_ real enough. Well, from this day forth I'll be a better
man. It's the kind of thing to sober a chap for life, this is. I'm glad
it was only wings, though. I'd rather see the birds as aren't there, and
couldn't be, even if they pretend to talk, than some things as I could
name."

He got up slowly and heavily, and went indoors, and he was so nice to
his wife that day that she felt quite happy, and said to herself, "Law,
whatever have a-come to the man!" and smartened herself up and put a
blue ribbon bow at the place where her collar fastened on, and looked so
pretty that he was kinder than ever. So perhaps the winged children
really did do one good thing that day. If so, it was the only one; for
really there is nothing like wings for getting you into trouble. But, on
the other hand, if you are in trouble, there is nothing like wings for
getting you out of it.

This was the case in the matter of the fierce dog who sprang out at them
when they had folded up their wings as small as possible and were going
up to a farm door to ask for a crust of bread and cheese, for in
spite of the plums they were soon just as hungry as ever again.

Now there is no doubt whatever that, if the four had been ordinary
wingless children, that black and fierce dog would have had a good bite
out of the brown-stockinged leg of Robert, who was the nearest. But at
its first growl there was a flutter of wings, and the dog was left to
strain at his chain and stand on his hind-legs as if he were trying to
fly too.

They tried several other farms, but at those where there were no dogs
the people were far too frightened to do anything but scream; and at
last, when it was nearly four o'clock, and their wings were getting
miserably stiff and tired, they alighted on a church-tower and held a
council of war.

"We can't possibly fly all the way home without dinner _or_ tea," said
Robert with desperate decision.

"And nobody will give us any dinner, or even lunch, let alone tea," said
Cyril.

"Perhaps the clergyman here might," suggested Anthea. "He must know all
about angels"--

"Anybody could see we're not that," said Jane. "Look at Robert's boots
and Squirrel's plaid necktie."

"Well," said Cyril firmly, "if the country you're in won't _sell_
provisions, you _take_ them. In wars I mean. I'm quite certain you do.
And even in other stories no good brother would allow his little sisters
to starve in the midst of plenty."

"Plenty?" repeated Robert hungrily; and the others looked vaguely round
the bare leads of the church-tower, and murmured, "In the midst of?"

"Yes," said Cyril impressively. "There is a larder window at the side of
the clergyman's house, and I saw things to eat inside--custard pudding
and cold chicken and tongue--and pies--and jam. It's rather a high
window--but with wings"--

"How clever of you!" said Jane.

"Not at all," said Cyril modestly; "any born general--Napoleon or the
Duke of Marlborough--would have seen it just the same as I did."

"It seems very wrong," said Anthea.

"Nonsense," said Cyril. "What was it Sir Philip Sidney said when the
soldier wouldn't give him a drink?--'My necessity is greater than his.'"

"We'll club together our money, though, and leave it to pay for the
things, won't we?" Anthea was persuasive, and very nearly in tears,
because it is most trying to feel enormously hungry and unspeakably
sinful at one and the same time.

"Some of it," was the cautious reply.

Everyone now turned out its pockets on the lead roof of the tower, where
visitors for the last hundred and fifty years had cut their own and
their sweethearts' initials with penknives in the soft lead. There was
five-and-seven-pence halfpenny altogether, and even the upright Anthea
admitted that that was too much to pay for four people's dinners. Robert
said he thought eighteenpence.

[Illustration: Every one now turned out his pockets]

And half-a-crown was finally agreed to be "handsome."

So Anthea wrote on the back of her last term's report, which happened to
be in her pocket, and from which she first tore her own name and that of
the school, the following letter:--

          "DEAR REVEREND CLERGYMAN,--We are very hungry
          indeed because of having to fly all day, and we
          think it is not stealing when you are starving to
          death. We are afraid to ask you for fear you
          should say 'No,' because of course you know about
          angels, but you would not think we were angels. We
          will only take the necessities of life, and no
          pudding or pie, to show you it is not grediness
          but true starvation that makes us make your larder
          stand and deliver. But we are not highwaymen by
          trade."

"Cut it short," said the others with one accord. And Anthea hastily
added--

          "Our intentions are quite honourable if you only
          knew. And here is half-a-crown to show we are
          sinseer and grateful.

          "Thank you for your kind hospitality.

                                          "FROM US FOUR."

The half-crown was wrapped in this letter, and all the children felt
that when the clergyman had read it he would understand everything, as
well as anyone could who had not even seen the wings.

"Now," said Cyril, "of course there's some risk; we'd better fly
straight down the other side of the tower and then flutter low across
the churchyard and in through the shrubbery. There doesn't seem to be
anyone about. But you never know. The window looks out into the
shrubbery. It is embowered in foliage, like a window in a story. I'll go
in and get the things. Robert and Anthea can take them as I hand them
out through the window; and Jane can keep watch,--her eyes are
sharp,--and whistle if she sees anyone about. Shut up, Robert! she can
whistle quite well enough for that, anyway. It ought not to be a very
good whistle--it'll sound more natural and birdlike. Now then--off we
go!"

I cannot pretend that stealing is right. I can only say that on this
occasion it did not look like stealing to the hungry four, but appeared
in the light of a fair and reasonable business transaction. They had
never happened to learn that a tongue,--hardly cut into,--a chicken and
a half, a loaf of bread, and a syphon of soda-water cannot be bought in
the stores for half-a-crown. These were the necessaries of life, which
Cyril handed out of the larder window when, quite unobserved and without
hindrance or adventure, he had led the others to that happy spot. He
felt that to refrain from jam, apple pie, cake, and mixed candied peel,
was a really heroic act--and I agree with him. He was also proud of not
taking the custard pudding,--and there I think he was wrong,--because if
he had taken it there would have been a difficulty about returning the
dish; no one, however starving, has a right to steal china pie-dishes
with little pink flowers on them. The soda-water syphon was different.
They could not do without something to drink, and as the maker's name
was on it they felt sure it would be returned to him wherever they might
leave it. If they had time they would take it back themselves. The
man appeared to live in Rochester, which would not be much out of their
way home.

[Illustration: These were the necessaries of life]

Everything was carried up to the top of the tower, and laid down on a
sheet of kitchen paper which Cyril had found on the top shelf of the
larder. As he unfolded it, Anthea said, "I don't think _that's_ a
necessity of life."

"Yes, it is," said he. "We must put the things down somewhere to cut
them up; and I heard father say the other day people got diseases from
germans in rain-water. Now there must be lots of rain-water here,--and
when it dries up the germans are left, and they'd get into the things,
and we should all die of scarlet fever."

"What are germans?"

"Little waggly things you see with microscopes," said Cyril, with a
scientific air. "They give you every illness you can think of. I'm sure
the paper was a necessary, just as much as the bread and meat and water.
Now then! Oh, I'm hungry!"

I do not wish to describe the picnic party on the top of the tower. You
can imagine well enough what it is like to carve a chicken and a tongue
with a knife that has only one blade and that snapped off short about
half-way down. But it was done. Eating with your fingers is greasy and
difficult--and paper dishes soon get to look very spotty and horrid. But
one thing you _can't_ imagine, and that is how soda-water behaves when
you try to drink it straight out of a syphon--especially a quite full
one. But if imagination will not help you, experience will, and you can
easily try it for yourself if you can get a grown-up to give you the
syphon. If you want to have a really thorough experience, put the tube
in your mouth and press the handle very suddenly and very hard. You had
better do it when you are alone--and out of doors is best for this
experiment.

However you eat them, tongue and chicken and new bread are very good
things, and no one minds being sprinkled a little with soda-water on a
really fine hot day. So that everyone enjoyed the dinner very much
indeed, and everyone ate as much as it possibly could: first, because it
was extremely hungry; and secondly, because, as I said, tongue and
chicken and new bread are very nice.

Now, I daresay you will have noticed that if you have to wait for your
dinner till long after the proper time, and then eat a great deal more
dinner than usual, and sit in the hot sun on the top of a
church-tower--or even anywhere else--you become soon and strangely
sleepy. Now Anthea and Jane and Cyril and Robert were very like you in
many ways, and when they had eaten all they could, and drunk all there
was, they became sleepy, strangely and soon--especially Anthea, because
she had gotten up so early.

[Illustration: The children were fast asleep]

One by one they left off talking and leaned back, and before it was a
quarter of an hour after dinner they had all curled round and tucked
themselves up under their large soft warm wings and were fast asleep.
And the sun was sinking slowly in the west. (I must say it was in the
west, because it is usual in books to say so, for fear careless people
should think it was setting in the east. In point of fact, it was not
exactly in the west either--but that's near enough.) The sun, I repeat,
was sinking slowly in the west, and the children slept warmly and
happily on--for wings are cosier than eider-down quilts to sleep under.
The shadow of the church-tower fell across the churchyard, and across
the Vicarage, and across the field beyond; and presently there were no
more shadows, and the sun had set, and the wings were gone. And still
the children slept. But not for long. Twilight is very beautiful, but it
is chilly; and you know, however sleepy you are, you wake up soon enough
if your brother or sister happens to be up first and pulls your blankets
off you. The four wingless children shivered and woke. And there they
were,--on the top of a church-tower in the dusky twilight, with blue
stars coming out by ones and twos and tens and twenties over their
heads,--miles away from home, with three shillings and three-halfpence
in their pockets, and a doubtful act about the necessities of life to
be accounted for if anyone found them with the soda-water syphon.

They looked at each other. Cyril spoke first, picking up the syphon--

"We'd better get along down and get rid of this beastly thing. It's dark
enough to leave it on the clergyman's doorstep, I should think. Come
on."

There was a little turret at the corner of the tower, and the little
turret had a door in it. They had noticed this when they were eating,
but had not explored it, as you would have done in their place. Because,
of course, when you have wings and can explore the whole sky, doors seem
hardly worth exploring.

Now they turned towards it.

"Of course," said Cyril "this is the way down."

It was. But the door was locked on the inside!

And the world was growing darker and darker. And they were miles from
home. And there was the soda-water syphon.

I shall not tell you whether anyone cried, nor, if so, how many cried,
nor who cried. You will be better employed in making up your minds what
you would have done if you had been in their place.




CHAPTER V

NO WINGS


Whether anyone cried or not, there was certainly an interval during
which none of the party was quite itself. When they grew calmer, Anthea
put her handkerchief in her pocket and her arm round Jane, and said--

"It can't be for more than one night. We can signal with our
handkerchiefs in the morning. They'll be dry then. And someone will come
up and let us out"--

"And find the syphon," said Cyril gloomily; "and we shall be sent to
prison for stealing"--

"You said it wasn't stealing. You said you were sure it wasn't."

"I'm not sure _now_" said Cyril shortly.

"Let's throw the thing away among the trees," said Robert, "then no one
can do anything to us."

"Oh yes,"--Cyril's laugh was not a light-hearted one,--"and hit some
chap on the head, and be murderers as well as--as the other thing."

"But we can't stay up here all night," said Jane; "and I want my tea."

"You _can't_ want your tea," said Robert; "you've only just had your
dinner."

"But I _do_ want it," she said; "especially when you begin talking about
stopping up here all night. Oh, Panther--I want to go home! I want to go
home!"

"Hush, hush," Anthea said. "Don't, dear. It'll be all right, somehow.
Don't, don't"--

"Let her cry," said Robert desperately; "if she howls loud enough,
someone may hear and come and let us out."

"And see the soda-water thing," said Anthea swiftly. "Robert, don't be a
brute. Oh, Jane, do try to be a man! It's just the same for all of us."

Jane did try to "be a man"--and reduced her howls to sniffs.

There was a pause. Then Cyril said slowly, "Look here. We must risk that
syphon. I'll button it up inside my jacket--perhaps no one will notice
it. You others keep well in front of me. There are lights in the
clergyman's house. They've not gone to bed yet. We must just yell as
loud as ever we can. Now all scream when I say three. Robert, you do the
yell like a railway engine, and I'll do the coo-ee like father's. The
girls can do as they please. One, two, three!"

A four-fold yell rent the silent peace of the evening, and a maid at one
of the Vicarage windows paused with her hand on the blind-cord.

"One, two, three!" Another yell, piercing and complex, startled the owls
and starlings to a flutter of feathers in the belfry below. The maid
flew from the Vicarage window and ran down the Vicarage stairs and into
the Vicarage kitchen, and fainted as soon as she had explained to the
man-servant and the cook and the cook's cousin that she had seen a
ghost. It was quite untrue, of course, but I suppose the girl's nerves
were a little upset by the yelling.

"One, two, three!" The Vicar was on his doorstep by this time, and there
was no mistaking the yell that greeted him.

"Goodness me," he said to his wife, "my dear, someone's being murdered
in the church! Give me my hat and a thick stick, and tell Andrew to come
after me. I expect it's the lunatic who stole the tongue."

The children had seen the flash of light when the Vicar opened his front
door. They had seen his dark form on his doorstep, and they had paused
for breath, and also to see what he would do.

When he turned back for his hat, Cyril said hastily--

"He thinks he only fancied he heard something. You don't half yell! Now!
One, two, three!"

It was certainly a whole yell this time, and the Vicar's wife flung her
arms round her husband and screamed a feeble echo of it.

"You shan't go!" she said, "not alone. Jessie!"--the maid unfainted and
came out of the kitchen,--"send Andrew at once. There's a dangerous
lunatic in the church, and he must go immediately and catch him."

"I expect he _will_ catch it too," said Jessie to herself as she went
through the kitchen door. "Here, Andrew," she said, "there's someone
screaming like mad in the church, and the missus says you're to go along
and catch it."

"Not alone, I don't," said Andrew in low firm tones. To his master he
merely said, "Yis sir."

"You heard those screams?"

"I did think I noticed a sort of something," said Andrew.

"Well, come on, then," said the Vicar. "My dear, I _must_ go!" He pushed
her gently into the sitting-room, banged the door, and rushed out,
dragging Andrew by the arm.

A volley of yells greeted them. Then as it died into silence Andrew
shouted, "Hullo, you there! Did you call?"

"Yes," shouted four far-away voices.

"They seem to be in the air," said the Vicar. "Very remarkable."

"Where are you?" shouted Andrew; and Cyril replied in his deepest
voice, very slow and loud--

"CHURCH! TOWER! TOP!"

"Come down, then!" said Andrew; and the same voice replied--

"_Can't! Door locked!_"

"My goodness!" said the Vicar. "Andrew, fetch the stable lantern.
Perhaps it would be as well to fetch another man from the village."

"With the rest of the gang about, very likely. No, sir; if this 'ere
ain't a trap--well, may I never! There's cook's cousin at the back door
now. He's a keeper, sir, and used to dealing with vicious characters.
And he's got his gun, sir."

"Hullo there!" shouted Cyril from the church-tower; "come up and let us
out."

"We're a-coming," said Andrew. "I'm a-going to get a policeman and a
gun."

"Andrew, Andrew," said the Vicar, "that's not the truth."

"It's near enough, sir, for the likes of them."

So Andrew fetched the lantern and the cook's cousin; and the Vicar's
wife begged them all to be very careful.

They went across the churchyard--it was quite dark now--and as they went
they talked. The Vicar was certain a lunatic was on the
church-tower--the one who had written the mad letter, and taken the cold
tongue and things. Andrew thought it was a "trap"; the cook's cousin
alone was calm. "Great cry, little wool," said he; "dangerous chaps is
quieter." He was not at all afraid. But then he had a gun. That was why
he was asked to lead the way up the worn, steep, dark steps of the
church-tower. He did lead the way, with the lantern in one hand and the
gun in the other. Andrew went next. He pretended afterwards that this
was because he was braver than his master, but really it was because he
thought of traps and he did not like the idea of being behind the others
for fear someone should come softly up behind him and catch hold of his
legs in the dark. They went on and on, and round and round the little
corkscrew staircase--then through the bell-ringers' loft, where the
bell-ropes hung with soft furry ends like giant caterpillars--then up
another stair into the belfry, where the big quiet bells are--and then
on up a ladder with broad steps--and then up a little stone stair. And
at the top of that there was a little door. And the door was bolted on
the stair side.

The cook's cousin, who was a gamekeeper, kicked at the door, and said--

"Hullo, you there!"

The children were holding on to each other on the other side of the
door, and trembling with anxiousness--and very hoarse with their howls.
They could hardly speak, but Cyril managed to reply huskily--

"Hullo, you there!"

"How did you get up there?"

It was no use saying "We flew up," so Cyril said--

"We got up--and then we found the door was locked and we couldn't get
down. Let us out--do."

"How many of you are there?" asked the keeper.

"Only four," said Cyril.

"Are you armed?"

"Are we what?"

"I've got my gun handy--so you'd best not try any tricks," said the
keeper. "If we open the door, will you promise to come quietly down, and
no nonsense?"

"Yes--oh YES!" said all the children together.

"Bless me," said the Vicar, "surely that was a female voice?"

"Shall I open the door, sir?" said the keeper. Andrew went down a few
steps, "to leave room for the others" he said afterwards.

"Yes," said the Vicar, "open the door. Remember," he said through the
keyhole, "we have come to release you. You will keep your promise to
refrain from violence?"

"How this bolt do stick," said the keeper; "anyone 'ud think it hadn't
been drawed for half a year." As a matter of fact it hadn't.

When all the bolts were drawn, the keeper spoke deep-chested words
through the keyhole.

[Illustration: The keeper spoke deep-chested words through the keyhole]

"I don't open," said he, "till you've gone over to the other side of the
tower. And if one of you comes at me I fire. Now!"

"We're all over on the other side," said the voices.

The keeper felt pleased with himself, and owned himself a bold man when
he threw open that door, and, stepping out into the leads, flashed the
full light of the stable lantern on the group of desperadoes standing
against the parapet on the other side of the tower.

He lowered his gun, and he nearly dropped the lantern.

"So help me," he cried, "if they ain't a pack of kiddies!"

The Vicar now advanced.

"How did you come here?" he asked severely. "Tell me at once."

"Oh, take us down," said Jane, catching at his coat, "and we'll tell you
anything you like. You won't believe us, but it doesn't matter. Oh, take
us down!"

The others crowded round him, with the same entreaty. All but Cyril.
He had enough to do with the soda-water syphon, which would keep
slipping down under his jacket. It needed both hands to keep it steady
in its place.

But he said, standing as far out of the lantern light as possible--

"Please do take us down."

So they were taken down. It is no joke to go down a strange church-tower
in the dark, but the keeper helped them--only, Cyril had to be
independent because of the soda-water syphon. It would keep trying to
get away. Half-way down the ladder it all but escaped. Cyril just caught
it by its spout, and as nearly as possible lost his footing. He was
trembling and pale when at last they reached the bottom of the winding
stair and stepped out on to the stones of the church-porch.

Then suddenly the keeper caught Cyril and Robert each by an arm.

"You bring along the gells, sir," said he; "you and Andrew can manage
them."

"Let go!" said Cyril; "we aren't running away. We haven't hurt your old
church. Leave go!"

"You just come along," said the keeper; and Cyril dared not oppose him
with violence, because just then the syphon began to slip again.

So they were marched into the Vicarage study, and the Vicar's wife came
rushing in.

"Oh, William, _are_ you safe?" she cried.

Robert hastened to allay her anxiety.

"Yes," he said, "he's quite safe. We haven't hurt them at all. And
please, we're very late, and they'll be anxious at home. Could you send
us home in your carriage?"

"Or perhaps there's a hotel near where we could get a carriage," said
Anthea. "Martha will be very anxious as it is."

The Vicar had sunk into a chair, overcome by emotion and amazement.

Cyril had also sat down, and was leaning forward with his elbows on his
knees because of the soda-water syphon.

"But how did you come to be locked up in the church-tower?" asked the
Vicar.

"We went up," said Robert slowly, "and we were tired, and we all went to
sleep, and when we woke up we found the door was locked, so we yelled."

"I should think you did!" said the Vicar's wife. "Frightening everybody
out of their wits like this! You ought to be ashamed of yourselves."

"We _are_," said Jane gently.

"But who locked the door?" asked the Vicar.

"I don't know at all," said Robert, with perfect truth. "Do please send
us home."

"Well, really," said the Vicar, "I suppose we'd better. Andrew, put the
horse to, and you can take them home."

"Not alone, I don't," said Andrew to himself.

And the Vicar went on, "let this be a lesson to you"---- He went on
talking, and the children listened miserably. But the keeper was not
listening. He was looking at the unfortunate Cyril. He knew all about
poachers, of course, so he knew how people look when they're hiding
something. The Vicar had just got to the part about trying to grow up
to be a blessing to your parents, and not a trouble and disgrace, when
the keeper suddenly said--

"Arst him what he's got there under his jacket;" and Cyril knew that
concealment was at an end. So he stood up, and squared his shoulders and
tried to look noble, like the boys in books that no one can look in the
face of and doubt that they come of brave and noble families, and will
be faithful to the death, and he pulled out the syphon and said--

"Well, there you are, then."

There was silence. Cyril went on--there was nothing else for it--

"Yes, we took this out of your larder, and some chicken and tongue and
bread. We were very hungry, and we didn't take the custard or jam. We
only took bread and meat and water,--and we couldn't help its being soda
kind,--just the necessaries of life; and we left half-a-crown to pay for
it, and we left a letter. And we're very sorry. And my father will pay a
fine and anything you like, but don't send us to prison. Mother would
be so vexed. You know what you said about not being a disgrace. Well,
don't you go and do it to us--that's all! We're as sorry as we can be.
There!"

"However did you get up to the larder window?" said Mrs. Vicar.

"I can't tell you that," said Cyril firmly.

"Is this the whole truth you've been telling me?" asked the clergyman.

"No," answered Jane suddenly; "it's all true, but it's not the whole
truth. We can't tell you that. It's no good asking. Oh, do forgive us
and take us home!" She ran to the Vicar's wife and threw her arms round
her. The Vicar's wife put her arms round Jane, and the keeper whispered
behind his hand to the Vicar--

"They're all right, sir--I expect it's a pal they're standing by.
Someone put 'em up to it, and they won't peach. Game little kids."

"Tell me," said the Vicar kindly, "are you screening someone else? Had
anyone else anything to do with this?"

"Yes," said Anthea, thinking of the Psammead; "but it wasn't their
fault."

"Very well, my dears," said the Vicar, "then let's say no more about it.
Only just tell us why you wrote such an odd letter."

"I don't know," said Cyril. "You see, Anthea wrote it in such a hurry,
and it really didn't seem like stealing then. But afterwards, when we
found we couldn't get down off the church-tower, it seemed just exactly
like it. We are all very sorry"--

"Say no more about it," said the Vicar's wife; "but another time just
think before you take other people's tongues. Now--some cake and milk
before you go home?"

When Andrew came to say that the horse was put to, and was he expected
to be led alone into the trap that he had plainly seen from the first,
he found the children eating cake and drinking milk and laughing at the
Vicar's jokes. Jane was sitting on the Vicar's wife's lap.

So you see they got off better than they deserved.

The gamekeeper, who was the cook's cousin, asked leave to drive home
with them, and Andrew was only too glad to have someone to protect him
from that trap he was so certain of.

When the wagonette reached their own house, between the chalk-quarry and
the gravel-pit, the children were very sleepy, but they felt that they
and the keeper were friends for life.

Andrew dumped the children down at the iron gate without a word.

"You get along home," said the Vicarage cook's cousin, who was a
gamekeeper. "I'll get me home on shanks' mare."

So Andrew had to drive off alone, which he did not like at all, and it
was the keeper that was cousin to the Vicarage cook who went with the
children to the door, and, when they had been swept to bed in a
whirlwind of reproaches, remained to explain to Martha and the cook and
the housemaid exactly what had happened. He explained so well that
Martha was quite amicable the next morning.

After that he often used to come over and see Martha, and in the
end--but that is another story, as dear Mr. Kipling says.

Martha was obliged to stick to what she had said the night before about
keeping the children indoors the next day for a punishment. But she
wasn't at all ugly about it, and agreed to let Robert go out for half an
hour to get something he particularly wanted.

This, of course, was the day's wish.

Robert rushed to the gravel-pit, found the Psammead, and presently
wished for--

But that, too, is another story.




CHAPTER VI

A CASTLE AND NO DINNER


The others were to be kept in as a punishment for the misfortunes of the
day before. Of course Martha thought it was naughtiness, and not
misfortune--so you must not blame her. She only thought she was doing
her duty. You know, grown-up people often say they do not like to punish
you, and that they only do it for your own good, and that it hurts them
as much as it hurts you--and this is really very often the truth.

Martha certainly hated having to punish the children quite as much as
they hated to be punished. For one thing, she knew what a noise there
would be in the house all day. And she had other reasons.

"I declare," she said to the cook, "it seems almost a shame keeping of
them indoors this lovely day; but they are that audacious, they'll be
walking in with their heads knocked off some of these days, if I don't
put my foot down. You make them a cake for tea to-morrow, dear. And
we'll have Baby along of us soon as we've got a bit forrard with our
work. Then they can have a good romp with him, out of the way. Now,
Eliza, come, get on with them beds. Here's ten o'clock nearly, and no
rabbits caught!"

People say that in Kent when they mean "and no work done."

So all the others were kept in, but Robert, as I have said, was allowed
to go out for half an hour to get something they all wanted. And that,
of course, was the day's wish.

He had no difficulty in finding the Sand-fairy, for the day was already
so hot that it had actually, for the first time, come out of its own
accord, and was sitting in a sort of pool of soft sand, stretching
itself, and trimming its whiskers, and turning its snail's eyes round
and round.

"Ha!" it said when its left eye saw Robert; "I've been looking for you.
Where are the rest of you? Not smashed themselves up with those wings,
I hope?"

"No," said Robert; "but the wings got us into a row, just like all the
wishes always do. So the others are kept indoors, and I was only let out
for half an hour--to get the wish. So please let me wish as quickly as I
can."

"Wish away," said the Psammead, twisting itself round in the sand. But
Robert couldn't wish away. He forgot all the things he had been thinking
about, and nothing would come into his head but little things for
himself, like candy, a foreign stamp album, or a knife with three blades
and a corkscrew. He sat down to think better of things the others would
not have cared for--such as a football, or a pair of leg-guards, or to
be able to lick Simpkins Minor thoroughly when he went back to school.

"Well," said the Psammead at last, "you'd better hurry up with that wish
of yours. Time flies."

"I know it does," said Robert. "_I_ can't think what to wish for. I wish
you could give one of the others their wish without their having to
come here to ask for it. Oh, _don't_!"

But it was too late. The Psammead had blown itself out to about three
times its proper size, and now it collapsed like a pricked bubble, and
with a deep sigh leaned back against the edge of the sand-pool, quite
faint with the effort.

"There!" it said in a weak voice; "it was tremendously hard--but I did
it. Run along home, or they're sure to wish for something silly before
you get there."

They were--quite sure; Robert felt this, and as he ran home his mind was
deeply occupied with the sort of wishes he might find they had wished in
his absence. They might wish for rabbits, or white mice, or chocolate,
or a fine day to-morrow, or even--and that was most likely--someone
might have said, "I do wish to goodness Robert would hurry up." Well, he
_was_ hurrying up, and so they would have had their wish, and the day
would be wasted. Then he tried to think what they could wish
for--something that would be amusing indoors. That had been his own
difficulty from the beginning. So few things are amusing indoors when
the sun is shining outside and you mayn't go out, however much you want
to do so.

Robert was running as fast as he could, but when he turned the corner
that ought to have brought him within sight of the architect's
nightmare--the ornamental iron-work on the top of the house--he opened
his eyes so wide that he had to drop into a walk; for you cannot run
with your eyes wide open. Then suddenly he stopped short, for there was
no house to be seen. The front garden railings were gone too, and where
the house had stood--Robert rubbed his eyes and looked again. Yes, the
others _had_ wished,--there was no doubt about it,--and they must have
wished that they lived in a castle; for there the castle stood, black
and stately, and very tall and broad, with battlements and lancet
windows, and eight great towers; and, where the garden and the orchard
had been, there were white things dotted like mushrooms. Robert walked
slowly on, and as he got nearer he saw that these were tents, and men in
armor were walking about among the tents--crowds and crowds of them.

[Illustration: There the castle stood, black and stately]

"Oh!" said Robert fervently. "They _have_! They've wished for a castle,
and it's being besieged! It's just like that Sand-fairy! I wish we'd
never seen the beastly thing!"

At the little window above the great gateway, across the moat that now
lay where the garden had been but half an hour ago, someone was waving
something pale dust-colored. Robert thought it was one of Cyril's
handkerchiefs. They had never been white since the day when he had upset
the bottle of "Combined Toning and Fixing Solution" into the drawer
where they were. Robert waved back, and immediately felt that he had
been unwise. For this signal had been seen by the besieging force, and
two men in steel-caps were coming towards him. They had high brown boots
on their long legs, and they came towards him with such great strides
that Robert remembered the shortness of his own legs and did not run
away. He knew it would be useless to himself, and he feared it might be
irritating to the foe. So he stood still--and the two men seemed quite
pleased with him.

"By my halidom," said one, "a brave varlet this!"

Robert felt pleased at being _called_ brave, and somehow it made him
_feel_ brave. He passed over the "varlet." It was the way people talked
in historical romances for the young, he knew, and it was evidently not
meant for rudeness. He only hoped he would be able to understand what
they said to him. He had not been always able quite to follow the
conversations in the historical romances for the young.

"His garb is strange," said the other. "Some outlandish treachery,
belike."

"Say, lad, what brings thee hither?"

Robert knew this meant, "Now then, youngster, what are you up to here,
eh?"--so he said--

"If you please, I want to go home."

"Go, then!" said the man in the longest boots; "none hindereth, and
nought lets us to follow. Zooks!" he added in a cautious undertone, "I
misdoubt me but he beareth tidings to the besieged."

"Where dwellest thou, young knave?" inquired the man with the largest
steel-cap.

"Over there," said Robert; and directly he had said it he knew he ought
to have said "Yonder!"

"Ha--sayest so?" rejoined the longest boots. "Come hither, boy. This is
matter for our leader."

And to the leader Robert was dragged forthwith--by the reluctant ear.

[Illustration: Robert was dragged forthwith--by the reluctant ear]

The leader was the most glorious creature Robert had ever seen. He was
exactly like the pictures Robert had so often admired in the historical
romances. He had armor, and a helmet, and a horse, and a crest, and
feathers, and a shield and a lance and a sword. His armor and his
weapons were all, I am almost sure, of quite different periods. The
shield was thirteenth century, while the sword was of the pattern
used in the Peninsular War. The cuirass was of the time of Charles I.,
and the helmet dated from the Second Crusade. The arms on the shield
were very grand--three red running lions on a blue ground. The tents
were of the latest brand approved of by our modern War Office, and the
whole appearance of camp, army, and leader might have been a shock to
some. But Robert was dumb with admiration, and it all seemed to him
perfectly correct, because he knew no more of heraldry or archæology
than the gifted artists who usually drew the pictures for the historical
romances. The scene was indeed "exactly like a picture." He admired it
all so much that he felt braver than ever.

"Come hither, lad," said the glorious leader, when the men in
Cromwellian steel-caps had said a few low eager words. And he took off
his helmet, because he could not see properly with it on. He had a kind
face, and long fair hair. "Have no fear; thou shalt take no scathe," he
said.

Robert was glad of that. He wondered what "scathe" was, and if it was
nastier than the medicine which he had to take sometimes.

"Unfold thy tale without alarm," said the leader kindly. "Whence comest
thou, and what is thine intent?"

"My what?" said Robert.

"What seekest thou to accomplish? What is thine errand, that thou
wanderest here alone among these rough men-at-arms? Poor child, thy
mother's heart aches for thee e'en now, I'll warrant me."

"I don't think so," said Robert; "you see, she doesn't know I'm out."

[Illustration: He wiped away a manly tear]

The leader wiped away a manly tear, exactly as a leader in a historical
romance would have done, and said--

"Fear not to speak the truth, my child; thou hast nought to fear from
Wulfric de Talbot."

Robert had a wild feeling that this glorious leader of the besieging
party--being himself part of a wish--would be able to understand better
than Martha, or the gipsies, or the policeman in Rochester, or the
clergyman of yesterday, the true tale of the wishes and the Psammead.
The only difficulty was that he knew he could never remember enough
"quothas" and "beshrew me's," and things like that, to make his talk
sound like the talk of a boy in a historical romance. However, he began
boldly enough, with a sentence straight out of _Ralph de Courcy; or, The
Boy Crusader_. He said--

"Grammercy for thy courtesy, fair sir knight. The fact is, it's like
this--and I hope you're not in a hurry, because the story's rather a
breather. Father and mother are away, and when we went down playing in
the sand-pits we found a Psammead."

"I cry thee mercy! A Sammyadd?" said the knight.

"Yes, a sort of--of fairy, or enchanter--yes, that's it, an enchanter;
and he said we could have a wish every day, and we wished first to be
beautiful."

"Thy wish was scarce granted," muttered one of the men-at-arms, looking
at Robert, who went on as if he had not heard, though he thought the
remark very rude indeed.

"And then we wished for money--treasure, you know; but we couldn't spend
it. And yesterday we wished for wings, and we got them, and we had a
ripping time to begin with"--

"Thy speech is strange and uncouth," said Sir Wulfric de Talbot. "Repeat
thy words--what hadst thou?"

"A ripping--I mean a jolly--no--we were contented with our lot--that's
what I mean; only, after we got into an awful fix."

"What is a fix? A fray, mayhap?"

"No--not a fray. A--a--a tight place."

"A dungeon? Alas for thy youthful fettered limbs!" said the knight, with
polite sympathy.

"It wasn't a dungeon. We just--just encountered undeserved misfortunes,"
Robert explained, "and to-day we are punished by not being allowed to go
out. That's where I live,"--he pointed to the castle. "The others are in
there, and they're not allowed to go out. It's all the Psammead's--I
mean the enchanter's fault. I wish we'd never seen him."

"He is an enchanter of might?"

"Oh yes--of might and main. Rather!"

"And thou deemest that it is the spells of the enchanter whom thou hast
angered that have lent strength to the besieging party," said the
gallant leader; "but know thou that Wulfric de Talbot needs no
enchanter's aid to lead his followers to victory."

"No, I'm sure you don't," said Robert, with hasty courtesy; "of course
not--you wouldn't, you know. But, all the same, it's partly his fault,
but we're most to blame. You couldn't have done anything if it hadn't
been for us."

"How now, bold boy?" asked Sir Wulfric haughtily. "Thy speech is dark,
and eke scarce courteous. Unravel me this riddle!"

"Oh," said Robert desperately, "of course you don't know it, but you're
not _real_ at all. You're only here because the others must have been
idiots enough to wish for a castle--and when the sun sets you'll just
vanish away, and it'll be all right."

The captain and the men-at-arms exchanged glances at first pitying, and
then sterner, as the longest-booted man said, "Beware, my noble lord;
the urchin doth but feign madness to escape from our clutches. Shall we
not bind him?"

"I'm no more mad than you are," said Robert angrily, "perhaps not so
much--Only, I was an idiot to think you'd understand anything. Let me
go--I haven't done anything to you."

"Whither?" asked the knight, who seemed to have believed all the
enchanter story till it came to his own share in it. "Whither wouldst
thou wend?"

"Home, of course." Robert pointed to the castle.

"To carry news of succor? Nay!"

"All right, then," said Robert, struck by a sudden idea; "then let me go
somewhere else." His mind sought eagerly among the memories of the
historical romance.

"Sir Wulfric de Talbot," he said slowly, "should think foul scorn to--to
keep a chap--I mean one who has done him no hurt--when he wants to cut
off quietly--I mean to depart without violence."

"This to my face! Beshrew thee for a knave!" replied Sir Wulfric. But
the appeal seemed to have gone home. "Yet thou sayest sooth," he added
thoughtfully. "Go where thou wilt," he added nobly, "thou art free.
Wulfric de Talbot warreth not with babes, and Jakin here shall bear thee
company."

"All right," said Robert wildly. "Jakin will enjoy himself, I think.
Come on, Jakin. Sir Wulfric, I salute thee."

He saluted after the modern military manner, and set off running to the
sand-pit, Jakin's long boots keeping up easily.

He found the Fairy. He dug it up, he woke it up, he implored it to give
him one more wish.

"I've done two to-day already," it grumbled, "and one was as stiff a bit
of work as ever I did."

"Oh, do, do, do, do, _do_!" said Robert, while Jakin looked on with an
expression of open-mouthed horror at the strange beast that talked, and
gazed with its snail's eyes at him.

[Illustration: "Oh, do, do, _do_!" said Robert]

"Well, what is it?" snapped the Psammead, with cross sleepiness.

"I wish I was with the others," said Robert. And the Psammead began to
swell. Robert never thought of wishing the castle and the siege away. Of
course he knew they had all come out of a wish, but swords and daggers
and pikes and lances seemed much too real to be wished away. Robert lost
consciousness for an instant. When he opened his eyes the others were
crowding round him.

"We never heard you come in," they said. "How awfully jolly of you to
wish it to give us our wish!"

"Of course we understood that was what you'd done."

"But you ought to have told us. Suppose we'd wished something silly."

"Silly?" said Robert, very crossly indeed. "How much sillier could you
have been, I'd like to know? You nearly settled _me_--I can tell
you."

Then he told his story, and the others admitted that it certainly had
been rough on him. But they praised his courage and cleverness so much
that he presently got back his lost temper, and felt braver than ever,
and consented to be captain of the besieged force.

"We haven't done anything yet," said Anthea comfortably; "we waited for
you. We're going to shoot at them through these little loopholes with
the bow and arrows uncle gave you, and you shall have first shot."

"I don't think I would," said Robert cautiously; "you don't know what
they're like near to. They've got _real_ bows and arrows--an awful
length--and swords and pikes and daggers, and all sorts of sharp things.
They're all quite, quite real. It's not just a--a picture, or a vision
or anything; they can _hurt us_--or kill us even, I shouldn't wonder. I
can feel my ear all sore yet. Look here--have you explored the castle?
Because I think we'd better let them alone as long as they let us alone.
I heard that Jakin man say they weren't going to attack till just
before sundown. We can be getting ready for the attack. Are there any
soldiers in the castle to defend it?"

"We don't know," said Cyril. "You see, directly I'd wished we were in a
besieged castle, everything seemed to go upside down, and when it came
straight we looked out of the window, and saw the camp and things and
you--and of course we kept on looking at everything. Isn't this room
jolly? It's as real as real!"

It was. It was square, with stone walls four feet thick, and great beams
for ceiling. A low door at the corner led to a flight of steps, up and
down. The children went down; they found themselves in a great arched
gate-house--the enormous doors were shut and barred. There was a window
in a little room at the bottom of the round turret up which the stair
wound, rather larger than the other windows, and looking through it they
saw that the drawbridge was up and the portcullis down; the moat looked
very wide and deep. Opposite the great door that led to the moat was
another great door, with a little door in it. The children went through
this, and found themselves in a big courtyard, with the great grey walls
of the castle rising dark and heavy on all four sides.

Near the middle of the courtyard stood Martha, moving her right hand
backwards and forwards in the air. The cook was stooping down and moving
her hands, also in a very curious way. But the oddest and at the same
time most terrible thing was the Lamb, who was sitting on nothing, about
three feet from the ground, laughing happily.

The children ran towards him. Just as Anthea was reaching out her arms
to take him, Martha said crossly, "Let him alone--do, miss, when he _is_
good."

"But what's he _doing_?" said Anthea.

"Doing? Why, a-setting in his high chair as good as gold, a precious,
watching me doing of the ironing. Get along with you, do--my iron's cold
again."

She went towards the cook, and seemed to poke an invisible fire with an
unseen poker--the cook seemed to be putting an unseen dish into an
invisible oven.

"Run along with you, do," she said; "I'm behindhand as it is. You won't
get no dinner if you come a-hindering of me like this. Come, off you
goes, or I'll pin a discloth to some of your tails."

"You're _sure_ the Lamb's all right?" asked Jane anxiously.

"Right as ninepence, if you don't come unsettling of him. I thought
you'd like to be rid of him for to-day; but take him, if you want him,
for gracious' sake."

"No, no," they said, and hastened away. They would have to defend the
castle presently, and the Lamb was safer even suspended in mid air in an
invisible kitchen than in the guard-room of the besieged castle. They
went through the first doorway they came to, and sat down helplessly on
a wooden bench that ran along the room inside.

"How awful!" said Anthea and Jane together; and Jane added, "I feel as
if I was in a lunatic asylum."

"What does it mean?" Anthea said. "It's creepy; I don't like it. I wish
we'd wished for something plain--a rocking-horse, or a donkey, or
something."

"It's no use wishing _now_," said Robert bitterly; and Cyril said--

"Do be quiet; I want to think."

He buried his face in his hands, and the others looked about them. They
were in a long room with an arched roof. There were wooden tables along
it, and one across at the end of the room, on a sort of raised platform.
The room was very dim and dark. The floor was strewn with dry things
like sticks, and they did not smell nice.

Cyril sat up suddenly and said--

"Look here--it's all right. I think it's like this. You know, we wished
that the servants shouldn't notice any difference when we got wishes.
And nothing happens to the Lamb unless we specially wish it to. So of
course they don't notice the castle or anything. But then the castle is
on the same place where our house was--is, I mean--and the servants have
to go on being in the house, or else they _would_ notice. But you can't
have a castle mixed up with our house--and so _we_ can't see the house,
because we see the castle; and they can't see the castle, because they
go on seeing the house; and so"--

"Oh, _don't_," said Jane; "you make my head go all swimmy, like being on
a roundabout. It doesn't matter! Only, I hope we shall be able to see
our dinner, that's all--because if it's invisible it'll be unfeelable as
well, and then we can't eat it! I _know_ it will, because I tried to
feel if I could feel the Lamb's chair and there was nothing under him at
all but air. And we can't eat air, and I feel just as if I hadn't had
any breakfast for years and years."

"It's no use thinking about it," said Anthea. "Let's go on exploring.
Perhaps we might find something to eat."

This lighted hope in every breast, and they went on exploring the
castle. But though it was the most perfect and delightful castle you can
possibly imagine, and furnished in the most complete and beautiful
manner, neither food nor men-at-arms were to be found in it.

"If you'd only thought of wishing to be besieged in a castle thoroughly
garrisoned and provisioned!" said Jane reproachfully.

"You can't think of everything, you know," said Anthea. "I should think
it must be nearly dinner-time by now."

It wasn't; but they hung about watching the strange movements of the
servants in the middle of the courtyard, because, of course, they
couldn't be sure where the dining-room of the invisible house was.
Presently they saw Martha carrying an invisible tray across the
courtyard, for it seemed that, by the most fortunate accident, the
dining-room of the house and the banqueting-hall of the castle were in
the same place. But oh, how their hearts sank when they perceived that
the tray _was_ invisible!

They waited in wretched silence while Martha went through the form of
carving an unseen leg of mutton and serving invisible greens and
potatoes with a spoon that no one could see. When she had left the room,
the children looked at the empty table, and then at each other.

"This is worse than anything," said Robert, who had not till now been
particularly keen on his dinner.

"I'm not so very hungry," said Anthea, trying to make the best of
things, as usual.

Cyril tightened his belt ostentatiously. Jane burst into tears.




CHAPTER VII

A SIEGE AND BED


The children were sitting in the gloomy banqueting-hall, at the end of
one of the long bare wooden tables. There was now no hope. Martha had
brought in the dinner, and the dinner was invisible, and unfeelable too;
for, when they rubbed their hands along the table, they knew but too
well that for them there was nothing there _but_ table.

Suddenly Cyril felt in his pocket.

"Right, _oh_!" he cried. "Look here! Biscuits."

Somewhat broken and crumbled, certainly, but still biscuits. Three whole
ones, and a generous handful of crumbs and fragments.

"I got them this morning--cook--and I'd quite forgotten," he explained
as he divided them with scrupulous fairness into four heaps.

They were eaten in a happy silence, though they had an odd taste,
because they had been in Cyril's pocket all the morning with a hank of
tarred twine, some green fir-cones, and a ball of cobbler's wax.

"Yes, but look here, Squirrel," said Robert; "you're so clever at
explaining about invisibleness and all that. How is it the biscuits are
here, and all the bread and meat and things have disappeared?"

"I don't know," said Cyril after a pause, "unless it's because _we_ had
them. Nothing about _us_ has changed. Everything's in my pocket all
right."

"Then if we _had_ the mutton it would be real," said Robert. "Oh, don't
I wish we could find it!"

"But we can't find it. I suppose it isn't ours till we've got it in our
mouths."

"Or in our pockets," said Jane, thinking of the biscuits.

"Who puts mutton in their pockets, goose-girl?" said Cyril. "But I
know--at any rate, I'll try it!"

He leaned over the table with his face about an inch from it, and kept
opening and shutting his mouth as if he were taking bites out of air.

"It's no good," said Robert in deep dejection. "You'll only---- Hullo!"

Cyril stood up with a grin of triumph, holding a square piece of bread
in his mouth. It was quite real. Everyone saw it. It is true that,
directly he bit a piece off, the rest vanished; but it was all right,
because he knew he had it in his hand though he could neither see nor
feel it. He took another bite from the air between his fingers, and it
turned into bread as he bit. The next moment all the others were
following his example, and opening and shutting their mouths an inch or
so from the bare-looking table. Robert captured a slice of mutton,
and--but I think I will draw a veil over the rest of this painful scene.
It is enough to say that they all had enough mutton, and that when
Martha came to change the plates she said she had never seen such a mess
in all her born days.

The pudding was, fortunately, a plain suet one, and in answer to
Martha's questions the children all with one accord said that they would
_not_ have molasses on it--nor jam, nor sugar--"Just plain, please,"
they said. Martha said, "Well, I never--what next, I wonder!" and went
away.

Then ensued another scene on which I will not dwell, for nobody looks
nice picking up slices of suet pudding from the table in its mouth, like
a dog.

The great thing, after all, was that they had had dinner; and now
everyone felt more courage to prepare for the attack that was to be
delivered before sunset. Robert, as captain, insisted on climbing to the
top of one of the towers to reconnoitre, so up they all went. And now
they could see all round the castle, and could see, too, that beyond the
moat, on every side, tents of the besieging party were pitched. Rather
uncomfortable shivers ran down the children's backs as they saw that all
the men were very busy cleaning or sharpening their arms, re-stringing
their bows, and polishing their shields. A large party came along the
road, with horses dragging along the great trunk of a tree; and Cyril
felt quite pale, because he knew this was for a battering-ram.

"What a good thing we've got a moat," he said; "and what a good thing
the drawbridge is up--I should never have known how to work it."

"Of course it would be up in a besieged castle."

"You'd think there ought to have been soldiers in it, wouldn't you?"
said Robert.

"You see you don't know how long it's been besieged," said Cyril darkly;
"perhaps most of the brave defenders were killed early in the siege and
all the provisions eaten, and now there are only a few intrepid
survivors,--that's us, and we are going to defend it to the death."

"How do you begin--defending to the death, I mean?" asked Anthea.

"We ought to be heavily armed--and then shoot at them when they advance
to the attack."

"They used to pour boiling lead down on besiegers when they got too
close," said Anthea. "Father showed me the holes on purpose for pouring
it down through at Bodiam Castle. And there are holes like it in the
gate-tower here."

"I think I'm glad it's only a game; it _is_ only a game, isn't it?" said
Jane.

But no one answered.

The children found plenty of strange weapons in the castle, and if they
were armed at all it was soon plain that they would be, as Cyril said,
"armed heavily"--for these swords and lances and crossbows were far too
weighty even for Cyril's manly strength; and as for the longbows, none
of the children could even begin to bend them. The daggers were better;
but Jane hoped that the besiegers would not come close enough for
daggers to be of any use.

"Never mind, we can hurl them like javelins," said Cyril, "or drop them
on people's heads. I say--there are lots of stones on the other side of
the courtyard. If we took some of those up? Just to drop on their heads
if they were to try swimming the moat."

So a heap of stones grew apace, up in the room above the gate; and
another heap, a shiny spiky dangerous-looking heap, of daggers and
knives.

As Anthea was crossing the courtyard for more stones, a sudden and
valuable idea came to her.

She went to Martha and said, "May we have just biscuits for tea? We're
going to play at besieged castles, and we'd like the biscuits to
provision the garrison. Put mine in my pocket, please, my hands are so
dirty. And I'll tell the others to fetch theirs."

This was indeed a happy thought, for now with four generous handfuls of
air, which turned to biscuits as Martha crammed it into their pockets,
the garrison was well provisioned till sundown.

They brought up some iron pots of cold water to pour on the besiegers
instead of hot lead, with which the castle did not seem to be provided.

The afternoon passed with wonderful quickness. It was very exciting; but
none of them, except Robert, could feel all the time that this was real
deadly dangerous work. To the others, who had only seen the camp and the
besiegers from a distance, the whole thing seemed half a game of
make-believe, and half a splendidly distinct and perfectly safe dream.
But it was only now and then that Robert could feel this.

When it seemed to be tea-time the biscuits were eaten, with water from
the deep well in the courtyard, drunk out of horns. Cyril insisted on
putting by eight of the biscuits, in case anyone should feel faint in
stress of battle.

Just as he was putting away the reserve biscuits in a sort of little
stone cupboard without a door, a sudden sound made him drop three. It
was the loud fierce cry of a trumpet.

"You see it _is_ real," said Robert, "and they are going to attack."

All rushed to the narrow windows.

"Yes," said Robert, "they're all coming out of their tents and moving
about like ants. There's that Jakin dancing about where the bridge
joins on. I wish he could see me put my tongue out at him! Yah!"

The others were far too pale to wish to put their tongues out at
anybody. They looked at Robert with surprised respect. Anthea said--

"You really _are_ brave, Robert."

"Rot!" Cyril's pallor turned to redness now, all in a minute. "He's been
getting ready to be brave all the afternoon. And I wasn't ready, that's
all. I shall be braver than he is in half a jiffy."

"Oh dear!" said Jane, "what does it matter which of you is the bravest?
I think Cyril was a perfect silly to wish for a castle, and I don't want
to play."

"It _isn't_"--Robert was beginning sternly, but Anthea interrupted--

"Oh yes, you do," she said coaxingly; "it's a very nice game, really,
because they can't possibly get in, and if they do the women and
children are always spared by civilised armies."

"But are you quite, quite sure they _are_ civilised?" asked Jane,
panting. "They seem to be such a long time ago."

"Of course they are." Anthea pointed cheerfully through the narrow
window. "Why, look at the little flags on their lances, how bright they
are--and how fine the leader is! Look, that's him--isn't it, Robert?--on
the gray horse."

Jane consented to look, and the scene was almost too pretty to be
alarming. The green turf, the white tents, the flash of pennoned lances,
the gleam of armour, and the bright colours of scarf and tunic--it was
just like a splendid coloured picture. The trumpets were sounding, and
when the trumpeters stopped for breath the children could hear the
cling-clang of armour and the murmur of voices.

A trumpeter came forward to the edge of the moat, which now seemed very
much narrower than at first, and blew the longest and loudest blast they
had yet heard. When the blaring noise had died away, a man who was with
the trumpeter shouted--

"What ho, within there!" and his voice came plainly to the garrison in
the gate-house.

"Hullo there!" Robert bellowed back at once.

"In the name of our Lord the King, and of our good lord and trusty
leader Sir Wulfric de Talbot, we summon this castle to surrender--on
pain of fire and sword and no quarter. Do ye surrender?"

"_No_" bawled Robert; "of course we don't! Never, _Never, NEVER_!"

The man answered back--

"Then your fate be on your own heads."

"Cheer," said Robert in a fierce whisper. "Cheer to show them we aren't
afraid, and rattle the daggers to make more noise. One, two, three! Hip,
hip, hooray! Again--Hip, hip, hooray! One more--Hip, hip, hooray!" The
cheers were rather high and weak, but the rattle of the daggers lent
them strength and depth.

There was another shout from the camp across the moat--and then the
beleaguered fortress felt that the attack had indeed begun.

It was getting rather dark in the room above the great gate, and Jane
took a very little courage as she remembered that sunset _couldn't_ be
far off now.

"The moat is dreadfully thin," said Anthea.

"But they can't get into the castle even if they do swim over," said
Robert. And as he spoke he heard feet on the stair outside--heavy feet
and the clang of steel. No one breathed for a moment. The steel and the
feet went on up the turret stairs. Then Robert sprang softly to the
door. He pulled off his shoes.

"Wait here," he whispered, and stole quickly and softly after the boots
and the spur-clank. He peeped into the upper room. The man was
there--and it was Jakin, all dripping with moat-water, and he was
fiddling about with the machinery which Robert felt sure worked the
drawbridge. Robert banged the door suddenly, and turned the great key in
the lock, just as Jakin sprang to the inside of the door. Then he tore
downstairs and into the little turret at the foot of the tower where the
biggest window was.

"We ought to have defended _this_!" he cried to the others as they
followed him. He was just in time. Another man had swum over, and his
fingers were on the window-ledge. Robert never knew how the man had
managed to climb up out of the water. But he saw the clinging fingers,
and hit them as hard as he could with an iron bar that he caught up from
the floor. The man fell with a splash into the moat-water. In another
moment Robert was outside the little room, had banged its door and was
shooting home the enormous bolts, and calling to Cyril to lend a hand.

[Illustration: The man fell with a splash into the moat-water]

Then they stood in the arched gate-house, breathing hard and looking at
each other.

Jane's mouth was open.

"Cheer up, Jenny," said Robert,--"it won't last much longer."

There was a creaking above, and something rattled and shook. The
pavement they stood on seemed to tremble. Then a crash told them that
the drawbridge had been lowered to its place.

"That's that beast Jakin," said Robert. "There's still the portcullis;
I'm almost certain that's worked from lower down."

And now the drawbridge rang and echoed hollowly to the hoofs of horses
and the tramp of armed men.

"Up--quick!" cried Robert,--"let's drop things on them."

Even the girls were feeling almost brave now. They followed Robert
quickly, and under his directions began to drop stones out through the
long narrow windows. There was a confused noise below, and some groans.

"Oh dear!" said Anthea, putting down the stone she was just going to
drop out, "I'm afraid we've hurt somebody!"

Robert caught up the stone in a fury.

"I should hope we _had_!" he said; "I'd give something for a jolly good
boiling kettle of lead. Surrender, indeed!"

And now came more tramping and a pause, and then the thundering thump of
the battering-ram. And the little room was almost pitch dark.

"We've held it," cried Robert, "we _won't_ surrender! The sun _must_ set
in a minute. Here--they're all jawing underneath again. Pity there's no
time to get more stones! Here, pour that water down on them. It's no
good, of course, but they'll hate it."

"Oh dear!" said Jane, "don't you think we'd better surrender?"

"Never!" said Robert; "we'll have a parley if you like, but we'll never
surrender. Oh, I'll be a soldier when I grow up--you just see if I
don't. I won't go into the Civil Service, whatever anyone says."

"Let's wave a handkerchief and ask for a parley," Jane pleaded. "I don't
believe the sun's going to set to-night at all."

"Give them the water first--the brutes!" said the bloodthirsty Robert.
So Anthea tilted the pot over the nearest lead-hole, and poured. They
heard a splash below, but no one below seemed to have felt it. And again
the ram battered the great door. Anthea paused.

[Illustration: Anthea tilted the pot over the nearest lead-hole]

"How idiotic," said Robert, lying flat on the floor and putting one eye
to the lead-hole. "Of course the holes go straight down into the
gate-house--that's for when the enemy has got past the door and the
portcullis, and almost all is lost. Here, hand me the pot." He crawled
on to the three-cornered window-ledge in the middle of the wall, and,
taking the pot from Anthea, poured the water out through the arrow-slit.

And as he began to pour, the noise of the battering-ram and the
trampling of the foe and the shouts of "Surrender!" and "De Talbot for
ever!" all suddenly stopped and went out like the snuff of a candle; the
little dark room seemed to whirl round and turn topsy-turvy, and when
the children came to themselves there they were, safe and sound, in the
big front bedroom of their own house--the house with the ornamental
nightmare iron-top to the roof.

They all crowded to the window and looked out. The moat and the tents
and the besieging force were all gone--and there was the garden with its
tangle of dahlias and marigolds and asters and later roses, and the
spiky iron railings and the quiet white road.

Everyone drew a deep breath.

"And that's all right!" said Robert. "I told you so! And, I say, we
didn't surrender, did we?"

"Aren't you glad now I wished for a castle?" asked Cyril.

"I think I am _now_," said Anthea slowly. "But I wouldn't wish for it
again, I think, Squirrel dear!"

"Oh, it was simply splendid!" said Jane unexpectedly. "I wasn't
frightened a bit."

"Oh, I say!" Cyril was beginning, but Anthea stopped him.

"Look here," she said, "it's just come into my head. This is the very
first thing we've wished for that hasn't got us into a row. And there
hasn't been the least little scrap of a row about this. Nobody's raging
downstairs, we're safe and sound, we've had an awfully jolly day--at
least, not jolly exactly, but you know what I mean. And we know now how
brave Robert is--and Cyril too, of course," she added hastily, "and
Jane as well. And we haven't got into a row with a single grown-up."

The door was opened suddenly and fiercely.

"You ought to be ashamed of yourselves," said the voice of Martha, and
they could tell by her voice that she was very angry indeed. "I thought
you couldn't last through the day without getting up to some mischief! A
person can't take a breath of air on the front doorstep but you must be
emptying the water jug on their heads! Off you go to bed, the lot of
you, and try to get up better children in the morning. Now then--don't
let me have to tell you twice. If I find any of you not in bed in ten
minutes I'll let you know it, that's all! A new cap, and everything!"

She flounced out amid a disregarded chorus of regrets and apologies. The
children were very sorry, but really it was not their faults.

You can't help it if you are pouring water on a besieging foe, and your
castle suddenly changes into your house--and everything changes with it
except the water, and that happens to fall on somebody else's clean cap.

"I don't know why the water didn't change into nothing, though," said
Cyril.

"Why should it?" asked Robert. "Water's water all the world over."

"I expect the castle well was the same as ours in the stable-yard," said
Jane. And that was really the case.

"I thought we couldn't get through a wish-day without a row," said
Cyril; "it was much too good to be true. Come on, Bobs, my military
hero. If we lick into bed sharp she won't be so furious, and perhaps
she'll bring us up some supper. I'm jolly hungry! Good-night, kids."

"Good-night. I hope the castle won't come creeping back in the night,"
said Jane.

"Of course it won't," said Anthea briskly, "but Martha will--not in the
night, but in a minute. Here, turn round, I'll get that knot out of your
pinafore strings."

"Wouldn't it have been degrading for Sir Wulfric de Talbot," said Jane
dreamily, "if he could have known that half the besieged garrison wore
pinafores?"

"And the other half knickerbockers. Yes--frightfully. Do stand
still--you're only tightening the knot," said Anthea.




CHAPTER VIII

BIGGER THAN THE BAKER'S BOY


"Look here," said Cyril. "I've got an idea."

"Does it hurt much?" said Robert sympathetically.

"Don't be a jackanape! I'm not humbugging."

"Shut up, Bobs!" said Anthea.

"Silence for the Squirrel's oration," said Robert.

Cyril balanced himself on the edge of the water-butt in the backyard,
where they all happened to be, and spoke.

"Friends, Romans, countrymen--and women--we found a Sammyadd. We have
had wishes. We've had wings, and being beautiful as the day--ugh!--that
was pretty jolly beastly if you like--and wealth and castles, and that
rotten gipsy business with the Lamb. But we're no forrarder. We haven't
really got anything worth having for our wishes."

"We've had things happening," said Robert; "that's always something."

"It's not enough, unless they're the right things," said Cyril firmly.
"Now I've been thinking"--

"Not really?" whispered Robert.

"In the silent what's-its-names of the night. It's like suddenly being
asked something out of history--the date of the Conquest or something;
you know it all right all the time, but when you're asked it all goes
out of your head. Ladies and gentlemen, you know jolly well that when
we're all rotting about in the usual way heaps of things keep cropping
up, and then real earnest wishes come into the heads of the beholder"--

"Hear, hear!" said Robert.

"--of the beholder, however, stupid he is," Cyril went on. "Why, even
Robert might happen to think of a really useful wish if he didn't injure
his poor little brains trying so hard to think.--Shut up, Bobs, I tell
you!--You'll have the whole show over."

A struggle on the edge of a water-butt is exciting but damp. When it was
over, and the boys were partially dried, Anthea said--

"It really was you began it, Bobs. Now honour is satisfied, do let
Squirrel go on. We're wasting the whole morning."

"Well then," said Cyril, still wringing the water out of the tails of
his jacket, "I'll call it pax if Bobs will."

"Pax then," said Robert sulkily. "But I've got a lump as big as a
cricket ball over my eye."

Anthea patiently offered a dust-coloured handkerchief, and Robert bathed
his wounds in silence. "Now, Squirrel," she said.

"Well then--let's just play bandits, or forts, or soldiers, or any of
the old games. We're dead sure to think of something if we try not to.
You always do."

The others consented. Bandits was hastily chosen for the game. "It's as
good as anything else," said Jane gloomily. It must be owned that
Robert was at first but a half-hearted bandit, but when Anthea had
borrowed from Martha the red-spotted handkerchief in which the keeper
had brought her mushrooms that morning, and had tied up Robert's head
with it so that he could be the wounded hero who had saved the bandit
captain's life the day before, he cheered up wonderfully. All were soon
armed. Bows and arrows slung on the back look well; and umbrellas and
cricket stumps through the belt give a fine impression of the wearer's
being armed to the teeth. The white cotton hats that men wear in the
country nowadays have a very brigandish effect when a few turkey's
feathers are stuck in them. The Lamb's mail-cart was covered with a
red-and-blue checked table-cloth, and made an admirable baggage-wagon.
The Lamb asleep inside it was not at all in the way. So the banditti set
out along the road that led to the sand-pit.

"We ought to be near the Sammyadd," said Cyril, "in case we think of
anything suddenly."

It is all very well to make up your minds to play bandit--or chess, or
ping-pong, or any other agreeable game--but it is not easy to do it with
spirit when all the wonderful wishes you can think of, or can't think
of, are waiting for you round the corner. The game was dragging a
little, and some of the bandits were beginning to feel that the others
were disagreeable things, and were saying so candidly, when the baker's
boy came along the road with loaves in a basket. The opportunity was not
one to be lost.

"Stand and deliver!" cried Cyril.

"Your money or your life!" said Robert.

And they stood on each side of the baker's boy. Unfortunately, he did
not seem to enter into the spirit of the thing at all. He was a baker's
boy of an unusually large size. He merely said--

"Chuck it now, d'ye hear!" and pushed the bandits aside most
disrespectfully.

Then Robert lassoed him with Jane's skipping-rope, and instead of going
round his shoulders, as Robert intended, it went round his feet and
tripped him up. The basket was upset, the beautiful new loaves went
bumping and bouncing all over the dusty chalky road. The girls ran to
pick them up, and all in a moment Robert and the baker's boy were
fighting it out, man to man, with Cyril to see fair play, and the
skipping-rope twisting round their legs like an interesting snake that
wished to be a peace-maker. It did not succeed; indeed the way the
boxwood handles sprang up and hit the fighters on the shins and ankles
was not at all peace-making. I know this is the second fight--or
contest--in this chapter, but I can't help it. It was that sort of day.
You know yourself there are days when rows seem to keep on happening,
quite without your meaning them to. If I were a writer of tales of
adventure such as those which used to appear in _The Boys of England_
when I was young of course I should be able to describe the fight, but I
cannot do it. I never can see what happens during a fight, even when it
is only dogs. Also, if I had been one of these _Boys of England_
writers, Robert would have got the best of it. But I am like George
Washington--I cannot tell a lie, even about a cherry-tree, much less
about a fight, and I cannot conceal from you that Robert was badly
beaten, for the second time that day. The baker's boy blacked his other
eye, and being ignorant of the first rules of fair play and gentlemanly
behaviour, he also pulled Robert's hair, and kicked him on the knee.
Robert always used to say he could have licked the baker if it hadn't
been for the girls. But I am not sure. Anyway, what happened was this,
and very painful it was to self-respecting boys.

[Illustration: He pulled Robert's hair]

Cyril was just tearing off his coat so as to help his brother in proper
style, when Jane threw her arms round his legs and began to cry and ask
him not to go and be beaten too. That "too" was very nice for Robert, as
you can imagine--but it was nothing to what he felt when Anthea rushed
in between him and the baker's boy, and caught that unfair and degraded
fighter round the waist, imploring him not to fight any more.

"Oh, don't hurt my brother any more!" she said in floods of tears. "He
didn't mean it--it's only play. And I'm sure he's very sorry."

You see how unfair this was to Robert. Because, if the baker's boy had
had any right and chivalrous instincts, and had yielded to Anthea's
pleading and accepted her despicable apology, Robert could not, in
honour, have done anything to him at any future time. But Robert's
fears, if he had any, were soon dispelled. Chivalry was a stranger to
the breast of the baker's boy. He pushed Anthea away very roughly, and
he chased Robert with kicks and unpleasant conversation right down the
road to the sand-pit, and there, with one last kick, he landed him in a
heap of sand.

"I'll larn you, you young varmint!" he said, and went off to pick up his
loaves and go about his business. Cyril, impeded by Jane, could do
nothing without hurting her, for she clung round his legs with the
strength of despair. The baker's boy went off red and damp about the
face; abusive to the last, he called them a pack of silly idiots, and
disappeared round the corner. Then Jane's grasp loosened. Cyril turned
away in silent dignity to follow Robert, and the girls followed him,
weeping without restraint.

It was not a happy party that flung itself down in the sand beside the
sobbing Robert. For Robert was sobbing--mostly with rage. Though of
course I know that a really heroic boy is always dry-eyed after a fight.
But then he always wins, which had not been the case with Robert.

Cyril was angry with Jane; Robert was furious with Anthea; the girls
were miserable; and not one of the four was pleased with the baker's
boy. There was, as French writers say, "a silence full of emotion."

Then Robert dug his toes and his hands into the sand and wriggled in his
rage. "He'd better wait till I'm grown up--the cowardly brute! Beast!--I
hate him! But I'll pay him out. Just because he's bigger than me."

"You began," said Jane incautiously.

"I know I did, silly--but I was only jollying--and he kicked me--look
here"--

Robert tore down a stocking and showed a purple bruise touched up with
red.

"I only wish I was bigger than him, that's all."

He dug his fingers in the sand, and sprang up, for his hand had touched
something furry. It was the Psammead, of course--"On the look-out to
make sillies of them as usual," as Cyril remarked later. And of course
the next moment Robert's wish was granted, and he was bigger than the
baker's boy. Oh, but much, much bigger! He was bigger than the big
policeman who used to be at the crossing at the Mansion House years
ago,--the one who was so kind in helping old ladies over the
crossing,--and he was the biggest man _I_ have ever seen, as well as the
kindest. No one had a foot-rule in its pocket, so Robert could not be
measured--but he was taller than your father would be if he stood on
your mother's head, which I am sure he would never be unkind enough to
do. He must have been ten or eleven feet high, and as broad as a boy of
that height ought to be. His suit had fortunately grown too, and now he
stood up in it--with one of his enormous stockings turned down to show
the gigantic bruise on his vast leg. Immense tears of fury still stood
on his flushed giant face. He looked so surprised, and he was so large
to be wearing a turned down collar outside of his jacket that the others
could not help laughing.

"The Sammyadd's done us again," said Cyril.

[Illustration: "The Sammyadd's done us again," said Cyril]

"Not us--_me_," said Robert. "If you'd got any decent feeling you'd try
to make it make you the same size. You've no idea how silly it feels,"
he added thoughtlessly.

"And I don't want to; I can jolly well see how silly it looks," Cyril
was beginning; but Anthea said--

"Oh, _don't_! I don't know what's the matter with you boys to-day. Look
here, Squirrel, let's play fair. It is hateful for poor old Bobs, all
alone up there. Let's ask the Sammyadd for another wish, and, if it
will, I do really think we ought all to be made the same size."

The others agreed, but not gaily; but when they found the Psammead, it
wouldn't.

"Not I," it said crossly, rubbing its face with its feet. "He's a rude
violent boy, and it'll do him good to be the wrong size for a bit. What
did he want to come digging me out with his nasty wet hands for? He
nearly touched me! He's a perfect savage. A boy of the Stone Age would
have had more sense."

Robert's hands had indeed been wet--with tears.

"Go away and leave me in peace, do," the Psammead went on. "I can't
think why you don't wish for something sensible--something to eat or
drink, or good manners, or good tempers. Go along with you, do!"

It almost snarled as it shook its whiskers, and turned a sulky brown
back on them. The most hopeful felt that further parley was vain.

They turned again to the colossal Robert.

"What ever shall we do?" they said; and they all said it.

"First," said Robert grimly, "I'm going to reason with that baker's boy.
I shall catch him at the end of the road."

"Don't hit a chap smaller than yourself, old man," said Cyril.

"Do I look like hitting him?" said Robert scornfully. "Why, I should
_kill_ him. But I'll give him something to remember. Wait till I pull up
my stocking." He pulled up his stocking, which was as large as a small
bolster-case, and strode off. His strides were six or seven feet long,
so that it was quite easy for him to be at the bottom of the hill, ready
to meet the baker's boy when he came down swinging the empty basket to
meet his master's cart, which had been leaving bread at the cottages
along the road.

Robert crouched behind a haystack in the farmyard, that is at the
corner, and when he heard the boy come whistling along he jumped out at
him and caught him by the collar.

"Now," he said, and his voice was about four times its usual size, just
as his body was four times its, "I'm going to teach you to kick boys
smaller than you."

He lifted up the baker's boy and set him on the top of the haystack,
which was about sixteen feet from the ground, and then he sat down on
the roof of the barn and told the baker's boy exactly what he thought of
him. I don't think the boy heard it all--he was in a sort of trance of
terror. When Robert had said everything he could think of, and some
things twice over, he shook the boy and said--

[Illustration: He lifted up the baker's boy and set him on top of the
haystack]

"And now get down the best way you can," and left him.

I don't know how the baker's boy got down, but I do know that he missed
the cart and got into the very hottest of hot water when he turned up at
last at the bakehouse. I am sorry for him, but after all, it was quite
right that he should be taught that boys mustn't use their feet when
they fight, but their fists. Of course the water he got into only became
hotter when he tried to tell his master about the boy he had licked
and the giant as high as a church, because no one could possibly believe
such a tale as that. Next day the tale was believed--but that was too
late to be of any use to the baker's boy.

When Robert rejoined the others he found them in the garden. Anthea had
thoughtfully asked Martha to let them have dinner out there--because the
dining-room was rather small, and it would have been so awkward to have
a brother the size of Robert in there. The Lamb, who had slept
peacefully during the whole stormy morning, was now found to be
sneezing, and Martha said he had a cold and would be better indoors.

"And really it's just as well," said Cyril, "for I don't believe he'd
ever have stopped screaming if he'd once seen you, the awful size you
are!"

Robert was indeed what a draper would call an "out-size" in boys. He
found himself able to step right over the iron gate in the front
garden.

Martha brought out the dinner--it was cold veal and baked potatoes, with
sago pudding and stewed plums to follow.

She of course did not notice that Robert was anything but the usual
size, and she gave him as much meat and potatoes as usual and no more.
You have no idea how small your usual helping of dinner looks when you
are many times your proper size. Robert groaned, and asked for more
bread. But Martha would not go on giving more bread for ever. She was in
a hurry, because the keeper intended to call on his way to Benenhurst
Fair, and she wished to be smartly dressed before he came.

"I wish _we_ were going to the Fair," said Robert.

"You can't go anywhere that size," said Cyril.

"Why not?" said Robert. "They have giants at fairs, much bigger ones
than me."

"Not much, they don't," Cyril was beginning, when Jane screamed "Oh!"
with such loud suddenness that they all thumped her on the back and
asked whether she had swallowed a plum-stone.

"No," she said, breathless from being thumped, "it's--it's not a
plum-stone. It's an idea. Let's take Robert to the Fair, and get them to
give us money for showing him! Then we really _shall_ get something out
of the old Sammyadd at last!"

"Take me, indeed!" said Robert indignantly. "Much more likely me take
you!"

And so it turned out. The idea appealed irresistibly to everyone but
Robert, and even he was brought round by Anthea's suggestion that he
should have a double share of any money they might make. There was a
little old pony-cart in the coach-house--the kind that is called a
governess-cart. It seemed desirable to get to the Fair as quickly as
possible, so Robert--who could now take enormous steps and so go very
fast indeed--consented to wheel the others in this. It was as easy to
him now as wheeling the Lamb in the mail-cart had been in the morning.
The Lamb's cold prevented his being of the party.

It was a strange sensation being wheeled in a pony-carriage by a giant.
Everyone enjoyed the journey except Robert and the few people they
passed on the way. These mostly went into what looked like some kind of
standing-up fits by the roadside, as Anthea said. Just outside
Benenhurst, Robert hid in a barn, and the others went on to the Fair.

[Illustration: It was a strange sensation being wheeled in a
pony-carriage by a giant]

There were some swings, and a hooting-tooting blaring merry-go-round,
and a shooting-gallery and Aunt Sallies. Resisting an impulse to win a
cocoanut,--or at least to attempt the enterprise,--Cyril went up to the
woman who was loading little guns before the array of glass bottles on
strings against a sheet of canvas.

"Here you are, little gentleman!" she said. "Penny a shot!"

"No, thank you," said Cyril, "we are here on business, not on pleasure.
Who's the master?"

"The what?"

"The master--the head--the boss of the show."

"Over there," she said, pointing to a stout man in a dirty linen jacket
who was sleeping in the sun; "but I don't advise you to wake him sudden.
His temper's contrairy, especially these hot days. Better have a shot
while you're waiting."

"It's rather important," said Cyril. "It'll be very profitable to him. I
think he'll be sorry if we take it away."

"Oh, if it's money in his pocket," said the woman. "No kid now? What is
it?"

"It's a _giant_."

"You _are_ kidding?"

"Come along and see," said Anthea.

The woman looked doubtfully at them, then she called to a ragged little
girl in striped stockings and a dingy white petticoat that came below
her brown frock, and leaving her in charge of the "shooting-gallery" she
turned to Anthea and said, "Well, hurry up! But if you _are_ kidding,
you'd best say so. I'm as mild as milk myself, but my Bill he's a fair
terror and"--

Anthea led the way to the barn. "It really _is_ a giant," she said.
"He's a giant little boy--in a suit like my brother's there. And we
didn't bring him up to the Fair because people do stare so, and they
seem to go into kind of standing-up fits when they see him. And we
thought perhaps you'd like to show him and get pennies; and if you like
to pay us something, you can--only, it'll have to be rather a lot,
because we promised him he should have a double share of whatever we
made."

The woman murmured something indistinct, of which the children could
only hear the words, "Swelp me!" "balmy," and "crumpet," which conveyed
no definite idea to their minds.

She had taken Anthea's hand, and was holding it very firmly; and Anthea
could not help wondering what would happen if Robert should have
wandered off or turned his proper size during the interval. But she knew
that the Psammead's gifts really did last till sunset, however
inconvenient their lasting might be; and she did not think, somehow,
that Robert would care to go out alone while he was that size.

When they reached the barn and Cyril called "Robert!" there was a stir
among the loose hay, and Robert began to come out. His hand and arm came
first--then a foot and leg. When the woman saw the hand she said "My!"
but when she saw the foot she said "Upon my word!" and when, by slow and
heavy degrees, the whole of Robert's enormous bulk was at last
disclosed, she drew a long breath and began to say many things, compared
with which "balmy" and "crumpet" seemed quite ordinary. She dropped into
understandable English at last.

"What'll you take for him?" she said excitedly. "Anything in reason.
We'd have a special van built--leastways, I know where there's a
second-hand one would do up handsome--what a baby elephant had, as died.
What'll you take? He's soft, ain't he? Them giants mostly is--but I
never see--no, never! What'll you take? Down on the nail. We'll treat
him like a king, and give him first-rate grub and a doss fit for a
bloomin' dook. He must be dotty or he wouldn't need you kids to cart him
about. What'll you take for him?"

"They won't take anything," said Robert sternly. "I'm no more soft than
you are--not so much, I shouldn't wonder. I'll come and be a show for
to-day if you'll give me,"--he hesitated at the enormous price he was
about to ask,--"if you'll give me fifteen shillings."

"Done," said the woman, so quickly that Robert felt he had been unfair
to himself, and wished he had asked thirty. "Come on now--and see my
Bill--and we'll fix a price for the season. I dessay you might get as
much as two pounds a week reg'lar. Come on--and make yourself as small
as you can for gracious' sake!"

This was not very small, and a crowd gathered quickly, so that it was at
the head of an enthusiastic procession that Robert entered the trampled
meadow where the Fair was held, and passed over the stubby yellow dusty
grass to the door of the biggest tent. He crept in, and the woman went
to call her Bill. He was the big sleeping man, and he did not seem at
all pleased at being awakened. Cyril, watching through a slit in the
tent, saw him scowl and shake a heavy fist and a sleepy head. Then the
woman went on speaking very fast. Cyril heard "Strewth," and "biggest
draw you ever, so help me!" and he began to share Robert's feeling that
fifteen shillings was indeed far too little. Bill slouched up to the
tent and entered. When he beheld the magnificent proportions of Robert
he said but little,--"Strike me pink!" were the only words the children
could afterwards remember,--but he produced fifteen shillings, mainly in
sixpences and coppers, and handed it to Robert.

"We'll fix up about what you're to draw when the show's over to-night,"
he said with hoarse heartiness. "Lor' love a duck! you'll be that happy
with us you'll never want to leave us. Can you do a song now--or a bit
of a breakdown?"

"Not to-day," said Robert, rejecting the idea of trying to sing "As once
in May," a favourite of his mother's, and the only song he could think
of at the moment.

"Get Levi and clear them bloomin' photos out. Clear the tent. Stick out
a curtain or suthink," the man went on. "Lor', what a pity we ain't got
no tights his size! But we'll have 'em before the week's out. Young man,
your fortune's made. It's a good thing you came to me, and not to some
chaps as I could tell you on. I've known blokes as beat their giants,
and starved 'em too; so I'll tell you straight, you're in luck this day
if you never was afore. 'Cos I'm a lamb, I am--and I don't deceive you."

"I'm not afraid of anyone beating me," said Robert, looking down on the
"lamb." Robert was crouched on his knees, because the tent was not big
enough for him to stand upright in, but even in that position he could
still look down on most people. "But I'm awfully hungry--I wish you'd
get me something to eat."

"Here, 'Becca," said the hoarse Bill. "Get him some grub--the best
you've got, mind!" Another whisper followed, of which the children only
heard, "Down in black and white--first thing to-morrow."

Then the woman went to get the food--it was only bread and cheese when
it came, but it was delightful to the large and empty Robert; and the
man went to post sentinels round the tent, to give the alarm if Robert
should attempt to escape with his fifteen shillings.

"As if we weren't honest," said Anthea indignantly when the meaning of
the sentinels dawned on her.

Then began a very strange and wonderful afternoon.

Bill was a man who knew his business. In a very little while, the
photographic views, the spyglasses you look at them through so that they
really seem rather real, and the lights you see them by, were all packed
away. A curtain--it was an old red-and-black carpet really--was run
across the tent. Robert was concealed behind, and Bill was standing on a
trestle-table outside the tent making a speech. It was rather a good
speech. It began by saying that the giant it was his privilege to
introduce to the public that day was the eldest son of the Emperor of
San Francisco, compelled through an unfortunate love affair with the
Duchess of the Fiji Islands to leave his own country and take refuge in
England--the land of liberty--where freedom was the right of every man,
no matter how big he was. It ended by the announcement that the first
twenty who came to the tent door should see the giant for threepence
apiece. "After that," said Bill, "the price is riz, and I don't
undertake to say what it won't be riz to. So now's yer time."

A young man with his sweetheart on her afternoon out was the first to
come forward. For this occasion his was the princely attitude--no
expense spared--money no object. His girl wished to see the giant? Well,
she should see the giant, even though seeing the giant cost threepence
each and the other entertainments were all penny ones.

The flap of the tent was raised--the couple entered. Next moment a wild
shriek from the girl thrilled through all present. Bill slapped his leg.
"That's done the trick!" he whispered to 'Becca. It was indeed a
splendid advertisement of the charms of Robert.

When the young girl came out she was pale and trembling, and a crowd was
round the tent.

[Illustration: When the girl came out she was pale and trembling]

"What was it like?" asked a farm-hand.

"Oh!--horrid!--you wouldn't believe," she said. "It's as big as a barn,
and that fierce. It froze the blood in my bones. I wouldn't ha' missed
seeing it for anything."

The fierceness was only caused by Robert's trying not to laugh. But the
desire to do that soon left him, and before sunset he was more inclined
to cry than laugh, and more inclined to sleep than either. For, by ones
and twos and threes, people kept coming in all the afternoon, and Robert
had to shake hands with those who wished it, and to allow himself to be
punched and pulled and patted and thumped, so that people might make
sure he was really real.

The other children sat on a bench and watched and waited, and were very
bored indeed. It seemed to them that this was the hardest way of earning
money that could have been invented. And only fifteen shillings! Bill
had taken four times that already, for the news of the giant had spread,
and trades-people in carts, and gentlepeople in carriages, came from far
and near. One gentleman with an eyeglass, and a very large yellow rose
in his buttonhole, offered Robert, in an obliging whisper, ten pounds a
week to appear at the Crystal Palace. Robert had to say "No."

"I can't," he said regretfully. "It's no use promising what you can't
do."

"Ah, poor fellow, bound for a term of years, I suppose! Well, here's my
card; when your time's up come to me."

[Illustration: "When your time's up come to me"]

"I will--if I'm the same size then," said Robert truthfully.

"If you grow a bit, so much the better," said the gentleman.

When he had gone, Robert beckoned Cyril and said--

"Tell them I must and will have a rest. And I want my tea."

Tea was provided, and a paper hastily pinned on the tent. It said--

            CLOSED FOR HALF AN HOUR
          WHILE THE GIANT GETS HIS TEA

Then there was a hurried council.

"How am I to get away?" said Robert.

"I've been thinking about it all the afternoon."

"Why, walk out when the sun sets and you're your right size. They can't
do anything to us."

Robert opened his eyes. "Why, they'd nearly kill us," he said, "when
they saw me get my right size. No, we must think of some other way. We
_must_ be alone when the sun sets."

"I know," said Cyril briskly, and he went to the door, outside which
Bill was smoking a clay pipe and talking in a low voice to 'Becca.
Cyril heard him say--"Good as havin' a fortune left you."

"Look here," said Cyril, "you can let people come in again in a minute.
He's nearly finished tea. But he _must_ be left alone when the sun sets.
He's very queer at that time of day, and if he's worried I won't answer
for the consequences."

"Why--what comes over him?" asked Bill.

"I don't know; it's--it's sort of a _change_," said Cyril candidly. "He
isn't at all like himself--you'd hardly know him. He's very queer
indeed. Someone'll get hurt if he's not alone about sunset." This was
true.

"He'll pull round for the evening, I s'pose?"

"Oh yes--half an hour after sunset he'll be quite himself again."

"Best humour him," said the woman.

And so, at what Cyril judged was about half an hour before sunset, the
tent was again closed "whilst the giant gets his supper."

The crowd was very merry about the giant's meals and their coming so
close together.

"Well, he can pick a bit," Bill owned. "You see he has to eat hearty,
being the size he is."

Inside the tent the four children breathlessly arranged a plan of
retreat.

"You go _now_," said Cyril to the girls, "and get along home as fast as
you can. Oh, never mind the pony-cart; we'll get that to-morrow. Robert
and I are dressed the same. We'll manage somehow, like Sydney Carton
did. Only, you girls _must_ get out, or it's all no go. We can run, but
you can't--whatever you may think. No, Jane, it's no good Robert going
out and knocking people down. The police would follow him till he turned
his proper size, and then arrest him like a shot. Go you must! If you
don't, I'll never speak to you again. It was you got us into this mess
really, hanging round people's legs the way you did this morning. _Go_,
I tell you!"

And Jane and Anthea went.

"We're going home," they said to Bill. "We're leaving the giant with
you. Be kind to him." And that, as Anthea said afterwards, was very
deceitful, but what were they to do?

When they had gone, Cyril went to Bill.

"Look here," he said, "he wants some ears of corn--there's some in the
next field but one. I'll just run and get it. Oh, and he says can't you
loop up the tent at the back a bit? He says he's stifling for a breath
of air. I'll see no one peeps in at him. I'll cover him up, and he can
take a nap while I go for the corn. He _will_ have it--there's no
holding him when he gets like this."

The giant was made comfortable with a heap of sacks and an old
tarpaulin. The curtain was looped up, and the brothers were left alone.
They matured their plan in whispers. Outside, the merry-go-round blared
out its comic tunes, screaming now and then to attract public notice.

Half a minute after the sun had set, a boy came out past Bill.

"I'm off for the corn," he said, and mingled quickly with the crowd.

At the same instant a boy came out of the back of the tent past 'Becca,
posted there as sentinel.

"I'm off after the corn," said this boy also. And he, too, moved away
quietly and was lost in the crowd. The front-door boy was Cyril; the
back-door was Robert--now, since sunset, once more his proper size. They
walked quickly through the field, along the road, where Robert caught
Cyril up. Then they ran. They were home as soon as the girls were, for
it was a long way, and they ran most of it. It was indeed a _very_ long
way, as they found when they had to go and drag the pony-cart home next
morning, with no enormous Robert to wheel them in it as if it were a
mail-cart, and they were babies and he was their gigantic nursemaid.

       *       *       *       *       *

I cannot possibly tell you what Bill and 'Becca said when they found
that the giant had gone. For one thing, I do not know.





CHAPTER IX

GROWN UP


Cyril had once pointed out that ordinary life is full of occasions on
which a wish would be most useful. And this thought filled his mind when
he happened to wake early on the morning after the morning after Robert
had wished to be bigger than the baker's boy, and had been it. The day
that lay between these two days had been occupied entirely by getting
the governess-cart home from Benenhurst.

Cyril dressed hastily; he did not take a bath, because tin baths are so
noisy, and he had no wish to rouse Robert, and he slipped off alone, as
Anthea had once done, and ran through the dewy morning to the sand-pit.
He dug up the Psammead very carefully and kindly, and began the
conversation by asking it whether it still felt any ill effects from
the contact with the tears of Robert the day before yesterday. The
Psammead was in good temper. It replied politely.

"And now, what can I do for you?" it said. "I suppose you've come here
so early to ask for something for yourself--something your brothers and
sisters aren't to know about, eh? Now, do be persuaded for your own
good! Ask for a good fat Megatherium and have done with it."

"Thank you--not to-day, I think," said Cyril cautiously. "What I really
wanted to say was--you know how you're always wishing for things when
you're playing at anything?"

"I seldom play," said the Psammead coldly.

"Well, you know what I mean," Cyril went on impatiently. "What I want to
say is: won't you let us have our wish just when we think of it, and
just where we happen to be? So that we don't have to come and disturb
you again," added the crafty Cyril.

"It'll only end in your wishing for something you don't really want, as
you did about the castle," said the Psammead, stretching its brown arms
and yawning. "It's always the same since people left off eating really
wholesome things. However, have it your own way. Good-bye."

"Good-bye," said Cyril politely.

"I'll tell you what," said the Psammead suddenly, shooting out its long
snail's eyes,--"I'm getting tired of you--all of you. You have no more
sense than so many oysters. Go along with you!"

And Cyril went.

"What an awful long time babies _stay_ babies," said Cyril after the
Lamb had taken his watch out of his pocket while he wasn't noticing, and
with coos and clucks of naughty rapture had opened the case and used the
whole thing as a garden spade, and when even immersion in a wash basin
had failed to wash the mould from the works and make the watch go again.
Cyril had said several things in the heat of the moment; but now he was
calmer, and had even consented to carry the Lamb part of the way to
the woods. Cyril had persuaded the others to agree to his plan, and not
to wish for anything more till they really did wish it. Meantime it
seemed good to go to the woods for nuts, and on the mossy grass under a
sweet chestnut tree the five were sitting. The Lamb was pulling up the
moss by fat handfuls, and Cyril was gloomily contemplating the ruins of
his watch.

[Illustration: He opened the case and used the whole thing as a garden
spade]

"He does grow," said Anthea. "Doesn't 'oo, precious?"

"Me grow," said the Lamb cheerfully--"me grow big boy, have guns' an'
mouses--an'--an'"---- Imagination or vocabulary gave out here. But
anyway it was the longest speech the Lamb had ever made, and it charmed
everyone, even Cyril, who tumbled the Lamb over and rolled him in the
moss to the music of delighted squeals.

"I suppose he'll be grown up some day," Anthea was saying, dreamily
looking up at the blue of the sky that showed between the long straight
chestnut-leaves. But at that moment the Lamb, struggling gaily with
Cyril, thrust a stout-shod little foot against his brother's chest;
there was a crack!--the innocent Lamb had broken the glass of father's
second-best Waterbury watch, which Cyril had borrowed without leave.

"Grow up some day!" said Cyril bitterly, plumping the Lamb down on the
grass. "I daresay he will--when nobody wants him to. I wish to goodness
he would"--

"_Oh_, take care!" cried Anthea in an agony of apprehension. But it was
too late--like music to a song her words and Cyril's came out together--

Anthea--"Oh, take care!"

Cyril--"Grow up now!"

The faithful Psammead was true to its promise, and there, before the
horrified eyes of its brothers and sisters, the Lamb suddenly and
violently grew up. It was the most terrible moment. The change was not
so sudden as the wish-changes usually were. The Baby's face changed
first. It grew thinner and larger, lines came in the forehead, the eyes
grew more deep-set and darker in colour, the mouth grew longer and
thinner; most terrible of all, a little dark mustache appeared on the
lip of one who was still--except as to the face--a two-year-old baby in
a linen smock and white open-work socks.

"Oh, I wish it wouldn't! Oh, I wish it wouldn't! You boys might wish as
well!"

They all wished hard, for the sight was enough to dismay the most
heartless. They all wished so hard, indeed, that they felt quite giddy
and almost lost consciousness; but the wishing was quite vain, for, when
the wood ceased to whirl round, their dazed eyes were riveted at once by
the spectacle of a very proper-looking young man in flannels and a straw
hat--a young man who wore the same little black mustache which just
before they had actually seen growing upon the Baby's lip. This, then,
was the Lamb--grown up! Their own Lamb! It was a terrible moment. The
grown-up Lamb moved gracefully across the moss and settled himself
against the trunk of the sweet chestnut. He tilted the straw hat over
his eyes. He was evidently weary. He was going to sleep. The Lamb--the
original little tiresome beloved Lamb often went to sleep at odd times
and in unexpected places. Was this new Lamb in the grey flannel suit and
the pale green necktie like the other Lamb? or had his mind grown up
together with his body?

That was the question which the others, in a hurried council held among
the yellowing brake-fern a few yards from the sleeper, debated eagerly.

"Whichever it is, it'll be just as awful," said Anthea. "If his inside
senses are grown up too, he won't stand our looking after him; and if
he's still a baby inside of him how on earth are we to get him to do
anything? And it'll be getting on for dinner-time in a minute."

"And we haven't got any nuts," said Jane.

"Oh bother nuts!" said Robert, "but dinner's different--I didn't have
half enough dinner yesterday. Couldn't we tie him to the tree and go
home to our dinner and come back afterwards?"

"A fat lot of dinner we should get if we went back without the Lamb!"
said Cyril in scornful misery. "And it'll be just the same if we go back
with him in the state he is now. Yes, I know it's my doing; don't rub it
in! I know I'm a beast, and not fit to live; you can take that for
settled, and say no more about it. The question is, what are we going to
do?"

"Let's wake him up, and take him into Rochester or Maidstone and get
something to eat at a baker's shop," said Robert hopefully.

"Take him?" repeated Cyril. "Yes--do! It's all my fault--I don't deny
that--but you'll find you've got your work cut out for you if you try to
take that young man anywhere. The Lamb always was spoilt, but now he's
grown up he's a demon--simply. I can see it. Look at his mouth."

"Well then," said Robert, "let's wake him up and see what _he'll_ do.
Perhaps _he'll_ take _us_ to Maidstone and stand treat. He ought to have
a lot of money in the pockets of those extra-special pants. We _must_
have dinner, anyway."

They drew lots with little bits of brake fern. It fell to Jane's lot to
waken the grown-up Lamb.

She did it gently by tickling his nose with a twig of honeysuckle. He
said "Bother the flies!" twice, and then opened his eyes.

[Illustration: She did it gently by tickling his nose with a twig of
honeysuckle]

"Hullo, kiddies!" he said in a languid tone, "still here? What's the
giddy hour? You'll be late for your grub!"

"I know we shall," said Robert bitterly.

"Then cut along home," said the grown-up Lamb.

"What about your grub, though?" asked Jane.

"Oh, how far is it to the station, do you think? I've a sort of a notion
that I'll run up to town and have some lunch at the club."

Blank misery fell like a pall on the four others. The
Lamb--alone--unattended--would go to town and have lunch at a club!
Perhaps he would also have tea there. Perhaps sunset would come upon him
amid the dazzling luxury of club-land, and a helpless cross sleepy
baby would find itself alone amid unsympathetic waiters, and would wail
miserably for "Panty" from the depths of a club arm-chair! The picture
moved Anthea almost to tears.

"Oh no, Lamb ducky, you mustn't do that!" she cried incautiously.

The grown-up Lamb frowned. "My dear Anthea," he said, "how often am I to
tell you that my name is Hilary or St. Maur or Devereux?--any of my
baptismal names are free to my little brothers and sisters, but _not_
'Lamb'--a relic of foolishness and far-off childhood."

This was awful. He was their elder brother now, was he? Well of course
he was, if he was grown-up--since they weren't. Thus, in whispers,
Anthea and Robert.

But the almost daily adventures resulting from the Psammead's wishes
were making the children wise beyond their years.

"Dear Hilary," said Anthea, and the others choked at the name, "you know
father didn't wish you to go to London. He wouldn't like us to be left
alone without you to take care of us. Oh, deceitful thing that I am!"
she added to herself.

"Look here," said Cyril, "if you're our elder brother, why not behave as
sich and take us over to Maidstone and give us a jolly good blow-out,
and we'll go on the river afterwards?"

"I'm infinitely obliged to you," said the Lamb courteously, "but I
should prefer solitude. Go home to your lunch--I mean your dinner.
Perhaps I may look in about tea-time--or I may not be home till after
you are in your beds."

Their beds! Speaking glances flashed between the wretched four. Much bed
there would be for them if they went home without the Lamb.

"We promised mother not to lose sight of you if we took you out," Jane
said before the others could stop her.

"Look here, Jane," said the grown-up Lamb, putting his hands in his
pockets and looking down at her, "little girls should be seen and not
heard. You kids must learn not to make yourselves a nuisance. Run along
home now--and perhaps, if you're good, I'll give you each a penny
to-morrow."

"Look here," said Cyril, in the best "man to man" tone at his command,
"where are you going, old man? You might let Bobs and me come with
you--even if you don't want the girls."

This was really rather noble of Cyril, for he never did care much about
being seen in public with the Lamb, who of course after sunset would be
a baby again.

The "man to man" tone succeeded.

"I shall run over to Maidstone on my bike," said the new Lamb airily,
fingering the little black mustache. "I can lunch at The Crown--and
perhaps I'll have a pull on the river; but I can't take you all on the
machine--now, can I? Run along home, like good children."

The position was desperate. Robert exchanged a despairing look with
Cyril. Anthea detached a pin from her waistband, a pin whose withdrawal
left a gaping chasm between skirt and bodice, and handed it furtively to
Robert--with a grimace of the darkest and deepest meaning. Robert
slipped away to the road. There, sure enough, stood a bicycle--a
beautiful new one. Of course Robert understood at once that if the Lamb
was grown up he _must_ have a bicycle.

[Illustration: There, sure enough, stood a bicycle]

This had always been one of Robert's own reasons for wishing to be
grown-up. He hastily began to use the pin--eleven punctures in the back
tyre, seven in the front. He would have made the total twenty-two but
for the rustling of the yellow hazel-leaves, which warned him of the
approach of the others. He hastily leaned a hand on each wheel, and was
rewarded by the "whish" of the what was left of air escaping from
eighteen neat pin-holes.

"Your bike's run down," said Robert, wondering how he could so soon have
learned to deceive.

"So it is," said Cyril.

"It's a puncture," said Anthea, stooping down, and standing up again
with a thorn which she had got ready for the purpose.

"Look here."

The grown-up Lamb (or Hilary, as I suppose one must now call him) fixed
his pump and blew up the tyre. The punctured state of it was soon
evident.

[Illustration: The punctured state of it was soon evident]

"I suppose there's a cottage somewhere near--where one could get a pail
of water?" said the Lamb.

There was; and when the number of punctures had been made manifest, it
was felt to be a special blessing that the cottage provided "teas for
cyclists." It provided an odd sort of tea-and-hammy meal for the Lamb
and his brothers. This was paid for out of the fifteen shillings which
had been earned by Robert when he was a giant--for the Lamb, it
appeared, had unfortunately no money about him. This was a great
disappointment for the others; but it is a thing that will happen, even
to the most grown-up of us. However, Robert had enough to eat, and that
was something. Quietly but persistently the miserable four took it in
turns to try and persuade the Lamb (or St. Maur) to spend the rest of
the day in the woods. There was not very much of the day left by the
time he had mended the eighteenth puncture. He looked up from the
completed work with a sigh of relief, and suddenly put his tie straight.

"There's a lady coming," he said briskly,--"for goodness' sake, get out
of the way. Go home--hide--vanish somehow! I can't be seen with a pack
of dirty kids." His brothers and sisters were indeed rather dirty,
because, earlier in the day, the Lamb, in his infant state, had
sprinkled a good deal of garden soil over them. The grown-up Lamb's
voice was so tyrant-like, as Jane said afterwards, that they actually
retreated to the back garden, and left him with his little mustache and
his flannel suit to meet alone the young lady, who now came up the front
garden wheeling a bicycle.

The woman of the house came out, and the young lady spoke to her,--the
Lamb raised his hat as she passed him,--and the children could not hear
what she said, though they were craning round the corner and listening
with all their ears. They felt it to be "perfectly fair," as Robert
said, "with that wretched Lamb in that condition."

When the Lamb spoke, in a languid voice heavy with politeness, they
heard well enough.

"A puncture?" he was saying. "Can I not be of any assistance? If you
could allow me----?"

There was a stifled explosion of laughter and the grown-up Lamb
(otherwise Devereux) turned the tail of an angry eye in its direction.

"You're very kind," said the lady, looking at the Lamb. She looked
rather shy, but, as the boys put it, there didn't seem to be any
nonsense about her.

"But oh," whispered Cyril, "I should have thought he'd had enough
bicycle-mending for one day--and if she only knew that really and truly
he's only a whiny-piny, silly little baby!"

"He's _not_," Anthea murmured angrily. "He's a dear--if people only let
him alone. It's our own precious Lamb still, whatever silly idiots may
turn him into--isn't he, Pussy?"

Jane doubtfully supposed so.

Now, the Lamb--whom I must try to remember to call St. Maur--was
examining the lady's bicycle and talking to her with a very grown-up
manner indeed. No one could possibly have supposed, to see and hear him,
that only that very morning he had been a chubby child of two years
breaking other people's Waterbury watches. Devereux (as he ought to be
called for the future) took out a gold watch when he had mended the
lady's bicycle, and all the hidden onlookers said "Oh!"--because it
seemed so unfair that the Baby, who had only that morning destroyed two
cheap but honest watches, should now, in the grown-upness to which
Cyril's folly had raised him, have a real gold watch--with a chain and
seals!

Hilary (as I will now term him) withered his brothers and sisters with a
glance, and then said to the lady--with whom he seemed to be quite
friendly--

"If you will allow me, I will ride with you as far as the Cross Roads;
it is getting late, and there are tramps about."

No one will ever know what answer the young lady intended to give to
this gallant offer, for, directly Anthea heard it made, she rushed out,
knocking against a swill pail, which overflowed in a turbid stream, and
caught the Lamb (I suppose I ought to say Hilary) by the arm. The others
followed, and in an instant the four dirty children were visible beyond
disguise.

"Don't let him," said Anthea to the lady, and she spoke with intense
earnestness; "he's not fit to go with anyone!"

"Go away, little girl!" said St. Maur (as we will now call him) in a
terrible voice.

"Go home at once!"

"You'd much better not have anything to do with him," the now reckless
Anthea went on. "He doesn't know who he is. He's something very
different from what you think he is."

"What do you mean?" asked the lady, not unnaturally, while Devereux (as
I must term the grown-up Lamb) tried vainly to push Anthea away. The
others backed her up, and she stood solid as a rock.

"You just let him go with you," said Anthea, "you'll soon see what I
mean! How would you like to suddenly see a poor little helpless baby
spinning along downhill beside you with its feet up on a bicycle it had
lost control of?"

The lady had turned rather pale.

"Who are these very dirty children?" she asked the grown-up Lamb
(sometimes called St. Maur in these pages).

"I don't know," he lied miserably.

"Oh, Lamb! how _can_ you?" cried Jane,--"when you know perfectly well
you're our own little baby brother that we're so fond of. We're his big
brothers and sisters," she explained, turning to the lady, who with
trembling hands was now turning her bicycle towards the gate, "and we've
got to take care of him. And we must get him home before sunset, or I
don't know whatever will become of us. You see, he's sort of under a
spell--enchanted--you know what I mean!"

Again and again the Lamb (Devereux, I mean) had tried to stop Jane's
eloquence, but Robert and Cyril held him, one by each leg, and no proper
explanation was possible. The lady rode hastily away, and electrified
her relatives at dinner by telling them of her escape from a family of
dangerous lunatics. "The little girl's eyes were simply those of a
maniac. I can't think how she came to be at large," she said.

When her bicycle had whizzed away down the road, Cyril spoke gravely.

"Hilary, old chap," he said, "you must have had a sunstroke or
something. And the things you've been saying to that lady! Why, if we
were to tell you the things you've said when you are yourself again,
say to-morrow morning, you wouldn't ever understand them--let alone
believe them! You trust to me, old chap, and come home now, and if
you're not yourself in the morning we'll ask the milkman to ask the
doctor to come."

The poor grown-up Lamb (St. Maur was really one of his Christian names)
seemed now too bewildered to resist.

"Since you seem all to be as mad as the whole worshipful company of
hatters," he said bitterly, "I suppose I _had_ better take you home. But
you're not to suppose I shall pass this over. I shall have something to
say to you all to-morrow morning."

"Yes, you will, my Lamb," said Anthea under her breath, "but it won't be
at all the sort of thing you think it's going to be."

In her heart she could hear the pretty, soft little loving voice of the
baby Lamb--so different from the affected tones of the dreadful grown-up
Lamb (one of whose names was Devereux)--saying, "Me love Panty--wants to
come to own Panty."

"Oh, let's go home, for goodness' sake," she said. "You shall say
whatever you like in the morning--if you can," she added in a whisper.

It was a gloomy party that went home through the soft evening. During
Anthea's remarks Robert had again made play with the pin and the bicycle
tyre, and the Lamb (whom they had to call St. Maur or Devereux or
Hilary) seemed really at last to have had his fill of bicycle-mending.
So the machine was wheeled.

The sun was just on the point of setting when they arrived at the White
House. The four elder children would have liked to linger in the lane
till the complete sunsetting turned the grown-up Lamb (whose Christian
names I will not further weary you by repeating) into their own dear
tiresome baby brother. But he, in his grown-upness, insisted on going
on, and thus he was met in the front garden by Martha.

Now you remember that, as a special favour, the Psammead had arranged
that the servants in the house should never notice any change brought
about by the wishes of the children. Therefore Martha merely saw the
usual party, with the baby Lamb, about whom she had been desperately
anxious all the afternoon, trotting beside Anthea, on fat baby legs,
while the children, of course, still saw the grown-up Lamb (never mind
what names he was christened by), and Martha rushed at him and caught
him in her arms, exclaiming--

"Come to his own Martha, then--a precious poppet!"

The grown-up Lamb (whose names shall now be buried in oblivion)
struggled furiously. An expression of intense horror and annoyance was
seen on his face. But Martha was stronger than he. She lifted him up and
carried him into the house. None of the children will ever forget that
picture. The neat grey-flannel-suited grown-up young man with the green
necktie and the little black mustache--fortunately, he was slightly
built, and not tall--struggling in the sturdy arms of Martha, who
bore him away helpless, imploring him, as she went, to be a good boy
now, and come and have his nice bremmink! Fortunately, the sun set as
they reached the doorstep, the bicycle disappeared, and Martha was seen
to carry into the house the real live darling sleepy two-year-old Lamb.
The grown-up Lamb (nameless henceforth) was gone for ever.

[Illustration: The grown-up Lamb struggled]

"For ever," said Cyril, "because, as soon as ever the Lamb's old enough
to be bullied, we must jolly well begin to bully him, for his own
sake--so that he mayn't grow up like _that_."

"You shan't bully him," said Anthea stoutly,--"not if I can stop it."

"We must tame him by kindness," said Jane.

"You see," said Robert, "if he grows up in the usual way, there'll be
plenty of time to correct him as he goes along. The awful thing to-day
was his growing up so suddenly. There was no time to improve him at
all."

"He doesn't want any improving," said Anthea as the voice of the Lamb
came cooing through the open door, just as she had heard it in her heart
that afternoon--

"Me loves Panty--wants to come to own Panty!"




CHAPTER X

SCALPS


Probably the day would have been a greater success if Cyril had not been
reading _The Last of the Mohicans_. The story was running in his head at
breakfast, and as he took his third cup of tea he said dreamily, "I wish
there were Red Indians in England--not big ones, you know, but little
ones, just about the right size for us to fight."

Everyone disagreed with him at the time and no one attached any
importance to the incident. But when they went down to the sand-pit to
ask for a hundred pounds in two-shilling pieces with Queen Victoria's
head on, to prevent mistakes--which they had always felt to be a really
reasonable wish that must turn out well--they found out that they had
done it again! For the Psammead, which was very cross and sleepy,
said--

"Oh, don't bother me. You've had your wish."

"I didn't know it," said Cyril.

"Don't you remember yesterday?" said the Sand-fairy, still more
disagreeably. "You asked me to let you have your wishes wherever you
happened to be, and you wished this morning, and you've got it."

"Oh, have we?" said Robert. "What is it?"

"So you've forgotten?" said the Psammead, beginning to burrow. "Never
mind; you'll know soon enough. And I wish you joy of it! A nice thing
you've let yourselves in for!"

"We always do somehow," said Jane sadly.

And now the odd thing was that no one could remember anyone's having
wished for anything that morning. The wish about the Red Indians had not
stuck in anyone's head. It was a most anxious morning. Everyone was
trying to remember what had been wished for, and no one could, and
everyone kept expecting something awful to happen every minute. It was
most agitating; they knew from what the Psammead had said, that they
must have wished for something more than usually undesirable, and they
spent several hours in most agonizing uncertainty. It was not till
nearly dinner-time that Jane tumbled over _The Last of the
Mohicans_,--which had of course, been left face downwards on the
floor,--and when Anthea had picked her and the book up she suddenly
said, "I know!" and sat down flat on the carpet.

"Oh, Pussy, how awful! It was Indians he wished for--Cyril--at
breakfast, don't you remember? He said, 'I wish there were Red Indians
in England,'--and now there are, and they're going about scalping people
all over the country, as likely as not."

"Perhaps they're only in Northumberland and Durham," said Jane
soothingly. It was almost impossible to believe that it could really
hurt people much to be scalped so far away as that.

"Don't you believe it!" said Anthea. "The Sammyadd said we'd let
ourselves in for a nice thing. That means they'll come _here_. And
suppose they scalped the Lamb!"

"Perhaps the scalping would come right again at sunset," said Jane; but
she did not speak so hopefully as usual.

"Not it!" said Anthea. "The things that grow out of the wishes don't go.
Look at the fifteen shillings! Pussy, I'm going to break something, and
you must let me have every penny of money you've got. The Indians will
come _here_, don't you see? That Spiteful Psammead as good as said so.
You see what my plan is? Come on!"

Jane did not see at all. But she followed her sister meekly into
mother's bedroom.

Anthea lifted down the heavy water-jug--it had a pattern of storks and
long grasses on it, which Anthea never forgot. She carried it into the
dressing-room, and carefully emptied the water out of it into the bath.
Then she took the jug back into the bedroom and dropped it on the floor.
You know how a jug always breaks if you happen to drop it by accident.
If you happen to drop it on purpose, it is quite different. Anthea
dropped that jug three times, and it was as unbroken as ever. So at last
she had to take her father's boot-tree and break the jug with that in
cold blood. It was heartless work.

Next she broke open the missionary-box with the poker. Jane told her
that it was wrong, of course, but Anthea shut her lips very tight and
then said--

[Illustration: She broke open the missionary-box with the poker.]

"Don't be silly--it's a matter of life and death."

There was not very much in the missionary-box,--only
seven-and-fourpence,--but the girls between them had nearly four
shillings. This made over eleven shillings, as you will easily see.

Anthea tied up the money in a corner of her pocket-handkerchief. "Come
on, Jane!" she said, and ran down to the farm. She knew that the farmer
was going into Rochester that afternoon. In fact it had been arranged
that he was to take the four children with him. They had planned this in
the happy hour when they believed that they we're going to get that
hundred pounds, in two-shilling pieces, out of the Psammead. They had
arranged to pay the farmer two shillings each for the ride. Now Anthea
hastily explained to him that they could not go, but would he take
Martha and the Baby instead? He agreed, but he was not pleased to get
only half-a-crown instead of eight shillings.

Then the girls ran home again. Anthea was agitated, but not flurried.
When she came to think it over afterwards, she could not help seeing
that she had acted with the most far-seeing promptitude, just like a
born general. She fetched a little box from her corner drawer, and went
to find Martha, who was laying the cloth and not in the best of tempers.

"Look here," said Anthea. "I've broken the water jug in mother's room."

"Just like you--always up to some mischief," said Martha, dumping down a
salt-cellar with a bang.

"Don't be cross, Martha dear," said Anthea. "I've got enough money to
pay for a new one--if only you'll be a dear and go and buy it for us.
Your cousins keep a china-shop, don't they? And I would like you to get
it to-day, in case mother comes home to-morrow. You know she said she
might perhaps."

"But you're all going into town yourselves," said Martha.

"We can't afford to, if we get the new jug," said Anthea; "but we'll pay
for you to go, if you'll take the Lamb. And I say, Martha, look
here--I'll give you my Liberty box, if you'll go. Look, it's most
awfully pretty--all inlaid with real silver and ivory and ebony, like
King Solomon's temple."

"I see," said Martha,--"no, I don't want your box, miss. What you want
is to get the precious Lamb off your hands for the afternoon. Don't you
go for to think I don't see through you!"

This was so true that Anthea longed to deny it at once. Martha had no
business to know so much. But she held her tongue.

Martha set down the bread with a bang that made it jump off its
trencher.

"I _do_ want the jug got," said Anthea softly. "You _will_ go, won't
you?"

"Well, just for this once, I don't mind; but mind you don't get into
none of your outrageous mischief while I'm gone--that's all!"

"He's going earlier than he thought," said Anthea eagerly. "You'd better
hurry and get dressed. Do put on that lovely purple frock, Martha, and
the hat with the pink cornflowers, and the yellow-lace collar. Jane'll
finish laying the cloth, and I'll wash the Lamb and get him ready."

As she washed the unwilling Lamb and hurried him into his best clothes,
Anthea peeped out of the window from time to time; so far all was
well--she could see no Red Indians. When with a rush and a scurry and
some deepening of the damask of Martha's complexion she and the Lamb had
been got off, Anthea drew a deep breath.

"_He's_ safe!" she said, and, to Jane's horror, flung herself down on
the floor and burst into floods of tears. Jane did not understand at all
how a person could be so brave and like a general, and then suddenly
give way and go flat like an air-balloon when you prick it. It is better
not to go flat, of course, but you will observe that Anthea did not give
way till her aim was accomplished. She had got the dear Lamb out of
danger--she felt certain that the Red Indians would be round the White
House or nowhere--the farmer's cart would not come back till after
sunset, so she could afford to cry a little. It was partly with joy that
she cried, because she had done what she meant to do. She cried for
about three minutes, while Jane hugged her miserably and said at
five-second intervals, "Don't cry, Panther dear!"

Then she jumped up, rubbed her eyes hard with the corner of her
pinafore, so that they kept red for the rest of the day, and started to
tell the boys. But just at that moment cook rang the dinner-bell, and
nothing could be said till they had been helped to minced beef. Then
cook left the room, and Anthea told her tale. But it is a mistake to
tell a thrilling tale when people are eating minced beef and boiled
potatoes. There seemed somehow to be something about the food that made
the idea of Red Indians seem flat and unbelievable. The boys actually
laughed, and called Anthea a little silly.

"Why," said Cyril, "I'm almost sure it was before I said that, that Jane
said she wished it would be a fine day."

"It wasn't," said Jane briefly.

"Why, if it was Indians," Cyril went on,--"salt, please, and mustard--I
must have something to make this mush go down,--if it was Indians,
they'd have been infesting the place long before this--you know they
would. I believe it's the fine day."

"Then why did the Sammyadd say we'd let ourselves in for a nice thing?"
asked Anthea. She was feeling very cross. She knew she had acted with
nobility and discretion, and after that it was very hard to be called a
little silly, especially when she had the weight of a burglared
missionary-box and about seven-and-fourpence, mostly in coppers, lying
like lead upon her conscience.

There was a silence, during which cook took away the mincy plates and
brought in the pudding. As soon as she had retired, Cyril began again.

"Of course I don't mean to say," he admitted, "that it wasn't a good
thing to get Martha and the Lamb out of the way for the afternoon; but
as for Red Indians--why, you know jolly well the wishes always come that
very minute. If there was going to be Red Indians, they'd be here now."

"I expect they are," said Anthea; "they're lurking amid the undergrowth,
for anything you know. I do think you're most unkind."

"Indians almost always _do_ lurk, really, though, don't they?" put in
Jane, anxious for peace.

"No, they don't," said Cyril tartly. "And I'm not unkind, I'm only
truthful. And I say it was utter rot breaking the water-jug; and as for
the missionary-box, I believe it's a treason-crime, and I shouldn't
wonder if you could be hanged for it, if any of us was to split"--

"Shut up, can't you?" said Robert; but Cyril couldn't. You see, he felt
in his heart that if there _should_ be Indians they would be entirely
his own fault, so he did not wish to believe in them. And trying not to
believe things when in your heart you are almost sure they are true, is
as bad for the temper as anything I know.

"It's simply idiotic," he said, "talking about Indians, when you can see
for yourself that it's Jane who's got her wish. Look what a fine day it
is----_OH!_--"

He had turned towards the window to point out the fineness of the
day--the others turned too--and a frozen silence caught at Cyril, and
none of the others felt at all like breaking it. For there, peering
round the corner of the window, among the red leaves of the Virginia
creeper, was a face--a brown face, with a long nose and a tight mouth
and very bright eyes. And the face was painted in coloured patches. It
had long black hair, and in the hair were feathers!

Every child's mouth in the room opened, and stayed open. The pudding was
growing white and cold on their plates. No one could move.

Suddenly the feathered head was cautiously withdrawn, and the spell was
broken. I am sorry to say that Anthea's first words were very like a
girl.

"There, now!" she said. "I told you so!"

The pudding had now definitely ceased to charm. Hastily wrapping their
portions in a _Spectator_ of the week before the week before last, they
hid them behind the crinkled paper stove-ornament, and fled upstairs to
reconnoitre and to hold a hurried council.

"Pax," said Cyril handsomely when they reached their mother's bedroom.
"Panther, I'm sorry if I was a brute."

"All right," said Anthea; "but you see now!"

No further trace of Indians, however, could be discerned from the
windows.

"Well," said Robert, "what are we to do?"

"The only thing I can think of," said Anthea, who was now generally
admitted to be the heroine of the day, "is--if we dressed up as like
Indians as we can, and looked out of the windows, or even went out. They
might think we were the powerful leaders of a large neighbouring tribe,
and--and not do anything to us, you know, for fear of awful vengeance."

"But Eliza, and the cook?" said Jane.

"You forget--they can't notice anything," said Robert. "They wouldn't
notice anything out of the way, even if they were scalped or roasted at
a slow fire."

"But would they come right at sunset?"

"Of course. You can't be really scalped or burned to death without
noticing it, and you'd be sure to notice it next day, even if it escaped
your attention at the time," said Cyril. "I think Anthea's right, but we
shall want a most awful lot of feathers."

"I'll go down to the hen-house," said Robert. "There's one of the
turkeys in there--it's not very well. I could cut its feathers without
it minding much. It's very bad--doesn't seem to care what happens to it.
Get me the cutting-out scissors."

Earnest reconnoitring convinced them all that no Indians were in the
poultry-yard. Robert went. In five minutes he came back--pale, but with
many feathers.

"Look here," he said, "this is jolly serious. I cut off the feathers,
and when I turned to come out there was an Indian squinting at me from
under the old hen-coop. I just brandished the feathers and yelled, and
got away before he could get the coop off top of himself. Panther, get
the coloured blankets off our beds, and look slippy, can't you?"

It is wonderful how like an Indian you can make yourself with blankets
and feathers and coloured scarves. Of course none of the children
happened to have long black hair, but there was a lot of black calico
that had been bought to cover school-books with. They cut strips of this
into a sort of fine fringe, and fastened it round their heads with the
amber-coloured ribbons off the girls' Sunday dresses. Then they stuck
turkeys' feathers in the ribbons. The calico looked very like long black
hair, especially when the strips began to curl up a bit.

"But our faces," said Anthea, "they're not at all the right colour.
We're all rather pale, and I'm sure I don't know why, but Cyril is the
colour of putty."

"I'm not," said Cyril.

"The real Indians outside seem to be brownish," said Robert hastily. "I
think we ought to be really _red_--it's sort of superior to have a red
skin, if you are one."

The red ochre cook uses for the kitchen bricks seemed to be about the
reddest thing in the house. The children mixed some in a saucer with
milk, as they had seen cook do for the kitchen floor. Then they
carefully painted each other's faces and hands with it, till they were
quite as red as any Red Indian need be--if not redder.

They knew at once that they must look very terrible when they met Eliza
in the passage, and she screamed aloud. This unsolicited testimonial
pleased them very much. Hastily telling her not to be a goose, and that
it was only a game, the four blanketed, feathered, really and truly
Redskins went boldly out to meet the foe. I say boldly. That is because
I wish to be polite. At any rate, they went.

Along the hedge dividing the wilderness from the garden was a row of
dark heads, all highly feathered.

"It's our only chance," whispered Anthea. "Much better than to wait for
their blood-freezing attack. We must pretend like mad. Like that game of
cards where you pretend you've got aces when you haven't. Fluffing they
call it, I think. Now then. Whoop!"

With four wild war-whoops--or as near them as white children could be
expected to go without any previous practice--they rushed through the
gate and struck four war-like attitudes in face of the line of Red
Indians. These were all about the same height, and that height was
Cyril's.

"I hope to goodness they can talk English," said Cyril through his
attitude.

Anthea knew they could, though she never knew how she came to know it.
She had a white towel tied to a walking-stick. This was a flag of truce,
and she waved it, in the hope that the Indians would know what it was.
Apparently they did--for one who was browner than the others stepped
forward.

"Ye seek a pow-wow?" he said in excellent English. "I am Golden Eagle,
of the mighty tribe of Rock-dwellers."

[Illustration: "Ye seek a pow-wow?" he said]

"And I," said Anthea, with a sudden inspiration, "am the Black
Panther--chief of the--the--the--Mazawattee tribe. My brothers--I don't
mean--yes, I do--the tribe--I mean the Mazawattees--are in ambush below
the brow of yonder hill."

"And what mighty warriors be these?" asked Golden Eagle, turning to the
others.

Cyril said he was the great chief Squirrel, of the Moning Congo tribe,
and, seeing that Jane was sucking her thumb and could evidently think of
no name for herself, he added, "This great warrior is Wild Cat--Pussy
Ferox we call it in this land--leader of the vast Phiteezi tribe."

"And thou, valorous Redskin?" Golden Eagle inquired suddenly of Robert,
who, taken unawares, could only reply that he was Bobs--leader of the
Cape Mounted Police.

"And now," said Black Panther, "our tribes, if we just whistle them up,
will far outnumber your puny forces; so resistance is useless. Return,
therefore, to your land, O brother, and smoke pipes of peace in your
wampums with your squaws and your medicine-men, and dress yourselves in
the gayest wigwams, and eat happily of the juicy fresh-caught
moccasins."

"You've got it all wrong," murmured Cyril angrily. But Golden Eagle only
looked inquiringly at her.

"Thy customs are other than ours, O Black Panther," he said. "Bring up
thy tribe, that we may hold pow-wow in state before them, as becomes
great chiefs."

"We'll bring them up right enough," said Anthea, "with their bows and
arrows, and tomahawks and scalping-knives, and everything you can think
of, if you don't look sharp and go."

She spoke bravely enough, but the hearts of all the children were
beating furiously, and their breath came in shorter and shorter gasps.
For the little real Red Indians were closing up round them--coming
nearer and nearer with angry murmurs--so that they were the centre of a
crowd of dark cruel faces.

"It's no go," whispered Robert. "I knew it wouldn't be. We must make a
bolt for the Psammead. It might help us. If it doesn't--well, I suppose
we shall come alive again at sunset. I wonder if scalping hurts as much
as they say."

"I'll wave the flag again," said Anthea. "If they stand back, we'll run
for it."

She waved the towel, and the chief commanded his followers to stand
back. Then, charging wildly at the place where the line of Indians was
thinnest, the four children started to run. Their first rush knocked
down some half-dozen Indians, over whose blanketed bodies the children
leaped, and made straight for the sand-pit. This was no time for the
safe easy way by which carts go down--right over the edge of the
sand-pit they went, among the yellow and pale purple flowers and dried
grasses, past the little bank martins' little front doors, skipping,
clinging, bounding, stumbling, sprawling, and finally rolling.

Yellow Eagle and his followers came up with them just at the very spot
where they had seen the Psammead that morning.

Breathless and beaten, the wretched children now awaited their fate.
Sharp knives and axes gleamed round them, but worse than these was the
cruel light in the eyes of Golden Eagle and his followers.

"Ye have lied to us, O Black Panther of the Mazawattees--and thou, too,
Squirrel of the Moning Congos. These also, Pussy Ferox of the Phiteezi,
and Bobs of the Cape Mounted Police,--these also have lied to us, if not
with their tongues, yet by their silence. Ye have lied under the cover
of the Truce-flag of the Pale-face. Ye have no followers. Your tribes
are far away--following the hunting trail. What shall be their doom?" he
concluded, turning with a bitter smile to the other Red Indians.

"Build we the fire!" shouted his followers; and at once a dozen ready
volunteers started to look for fuel. The four children, each held
between two strong little Indians, cast despairing glances round them.
Oh, if they could only see the Psammead!

"Do you mean to scalp us first and then roast us?" asked Anthea
desperately.

"Of course!" Redskin opened his eyes at her. "It's always done."

The Indians had formed a ring round the children, and now sat on the
ground gazing at their captives. There was a threatening silence.

Then slowly, by twos and threes, the Indians who had gone to look for
firewood came back, and they came back empty-handed. They had not been
able to find a single stick of wood for a fire! No one ever can, as a
matter of fact, in that part of Kent.

The children drew a deep breath of relief, but it ended in a moan of
terror. For bright knives were being brandished all about them. Next
moment each child was seized by an Indian; each closed its eyes and
tried not to scream. They waited for the sharp agony of the knife. It
did not come. Next moment they were released, and fell in a trembling
heap. Their heads did not hurt at all. They only felt strangely cool!
Wild war-whoops rang in their ears. When they ventured to open their
eyes they saw four of their foes dancing round them with wild leaps and
screams, and each of the four brandished in his hand a scalp of long
flowing black hair. They put their hands to their heads--their own
scalps were safe! The poor untutored savages had indeed scalped the
children. But they had only, so to speak, scalped them of the black
calico ringlets!

[Illustration: Bright knives were being brandished all about them]

The children fell into each other's arms, sobbing and laughing.

"Their scalps are ours," chanted the chief; "ill-rooted were their
ill-fated hairs! They came off in the hands of the victors--without
struggle, without resistance, they yielded their scalps to the
conquering Rock-dwellers! Oh, how little a thing is a scalp so lightly
won!"

"They'll take our real ones in a minute; you see if they don't," said
Robert, trying to rub some of the red ochre off his face and hands on to
his hair.

"Cheated of our just and fiery revenge are we," the chant went on,--"but
there are other torments than the scalping-knife and the flames. Yet is
the slow fire the correct thing. O strange unnatural country, wherein a
man may find no wood to burn his enemy!--Ah for the boundless forests of
my native land, where the great trees for thousands of miles grow but to
furnish firewood wherewithal to burn our foes. Ah, would we were but in
our native forest once more!"

Suddenly like a flash of lightning, the golden gravel shone all round
the four children instead of the dusky figures. For every single
Indian had vanished on the instant at their leader's word. The Psammead
must have been there all the time. And it had given the Indian chief his
wish.

       *       *       *       *       *

Martha brought home a jug with a pattern of storks and long grasses on
it. Also she brought back all Anthea's money.

"My cousin, she gave me the jug for luck; she said it was an odd one
what the basin of had got smashed."

"Oh, Martha, you are a dear!" sighed Anthea, throwing her arms round
her.

"Yes," giggled Martha, "you'd better make the most of me while you've
got me. I shall give your ma notice directly minute she comes back."

"Oh, Martha, we haven't been so _very_ horrid to you, have we?" asked
Anthea, aghast.

"Oh, it isn't that, miss." Martha giggled more than ever. "I'm a-goin'
to be married. It's Beale the gamekeeper. He's been a-proposin' to me
off and on ever since you come home from the clergyman's where you got
locked up on the church-tower. And to-day I said the word an' made him a
happy man."

       *       *       *       *       *

Anthea put the seven-and-fourpence back in the missionary-box, and
pasted paper over the place where the poker had broken it. She was very
glad to be able to do this, and she does not know to this day whether
breaking open a missionary-box is or is not a hanging matter!




CHAPTER XI (AND LAST)

THE LAST WISH


Of course you, who see above that this is the eleventh (and last)
chapter, know very well that the day of which this chapter tells must be
the last on which Cyril, Anthea, Robert, and Jane will have a chance of
getting anything out of the Psammead, or Sand-fairy.

But the children themselves did not know this. They were full of rosy
visions, and, whereas on the other days they had often found it
extremely difficult to think of anything really nice to wish for, their
brains were now full of the most beautiful and sensible ideas. "This,"
as Jane remarked afterwards, "is always the way." Everyone was up extra
early that morning, and these plans were hopefully discussed in the
garden before breakfast. The old idea of one hundred pounds in modern
florins was still first favourite, but there were others that ran it
close--the chief of these being the "pony-each" idea. This had a great
advantage. You could wish for a pony each during the morning, ride it
all day, have it vanish at sunset, and wish it back again next day.
Which would be an economy of litter and stabling. But at breakfast two
things happened. First, there was a letter from mother. Granny was
better, and mother and father hoped to be home that very afternoon. A
cheer arose. And of course this news at once scattered all the
before-breakfast wish-ideas. For everyone saw quite plainly that the
wish of the day must be something to please mother and not to please
themselves.

"I wonder what she _would_ like," pondered Cyril.

"She'd like us all to be good," said Jane primly.

"Yes--but that's so dull for us," Cyril rejoined; "and besides, I should
hope we could be that without sand-fairies to help us. No; it must be
something splendid, that we couldn't possibly get without wishing for."

"Look out," said Anthea in a warning voice; "don't forget yesterday.
Remember, we get our wishes now just wherever we happen to be when we
say 'I wish.' Don't let's let ourselves in for anything silly--to-day of
all days."

"All right," said Cyril. "You needn't talk so much."

Just then Martha came in with a jug full of hot water for the
tea-pot--and a face full of importance for the children.

"A blessing we're all alive to eat our breakfast!" she said darkly.

"Why, whatever's happened?" everybody asked.

"Oh, nothing," said Martha, "only it seems nobody's safe from being
murdered in their beds nowadays."

"Why," said Jane as an agreeable thrill of horror ran down her back and
legs and out at her toes, "_has_ anyone been murdered in their beds?"

"Well--not exactly," said Martha; "but they might just as well. There's
been burglars over at Peasemarsh Place--Beale's just told me--and
they've took every single one of Lady Chittenden's diamonds and jewels
and things, and she's a-goin out of one fainting fit into another, with
hardly time to say 'Oh, my diamonds!' in between. And Lord Chittenden's
away in London."

"Lady Chittenden," said Anthea; "we've seen her. She wears a
red-and-white dress, and she has no children of her own and can't abide
other folkses'."

"That's her," said Martha. "Well, she's put all her trust in riches, and
you see how she's served. They say the diamonds and things was worth
thousands of pounds. There was a necklace and a river--whatever that
is--and no end of bracelets; and a tarrer and ever so many rings. But
there, I mustn't stand talking and all the place to clean down afore
your ma comes home."

"I don't see why she should ever have had such lots of diamonds," said
Anthea when Martha had flounced off. "She was not at all a nice lady, I
thought. And mother hasn't any diamonds, and hardly any jewels--the
topaz necklace, and the sapphire ring daddy gave her when they were
engaged, and the garnet star, and the little pearl brooch with
great-grandpapa's hair in it,--that's about all."

"When I'm grown up I'll buy mother no end of diamonds," said Robert, "if
she wants them. I shall make so much money exploring in Africa I shan't
know what to do with it."

"Wouldn't it be jolly," said Jane dreamily, "if mother could find all
these lovely things, necklaces and rivers of diamonds and tarrers?"

"_Ti--aras_," said Cyril.

"Ti--aras, then,--and rings and everything in her room when she came
home. I wish she would"--

The others gazed at her in horror.

"Well, she _will_," said Robert; "you've wished, my good Jane--and our
only chance now is to find the Psammead, and if it's in a good temper
it _may_ take back the wish and give us another. If not--well--goodness
knows what we're in for!--the police of course, and---- Don't cry,
silly! We'll stand by you. Father says we need never to be afraid if we
don't do anything wrong and always speak the truth."

But Cyril and Anthea exchanged gloomy glances. They remembered how
convincing the truth about the Psammead had been once before when told
to the police.

It was a day of misfortunes. Of course the Psammead could not be found.
Nor the jewels, though every one of the children searched the mother's
room again and again.

"Of course," Robert said, "_we_ couldn't find them. It'll be mother
who'll do that. Perhaps she'll think they've been in the house for years
and years, and never know they are the stolen ones at all."

"Oh yes!" Cyril was very scornful; "then mother will be a receiver of
stolen goods, and you know jolly well what _that's_ worse than."

Another and exhaustive search of the sand-pit failed to reveal the
Psammead, so the children went back to the house slowly and sadly.

"I don't care," said Anthea stoutly, "we'll tell mother the truth, and
she'll give back the jewels--and make everything all right."

"Do you think so?" said Cyril slowly. "Do you think she'll believe us?
Could anyone believe about a Sammyadd unless they'd seen it? She'll
think we're pretending. Or else she'll think we're raving mad, and then
we shall be sent to the mad-house. How would you like it?"--he turned
suddenly on the miserable Jane,--"how would you like it, to be shut up
in an iron cage with bars and padded walls, and nothing to do but stick
straws in your hair all day, and listen to the howlings and ravings of
the other maniacs? Make up your minds to it, all of you. It's no use
telling mother."

"But it's true," said Jane.

"Of course it is, but it's not true enough for grown-up people to
believe it," said Anthea.

"Cyril's right. Let's put flowers in all the vases, and try not to think
about the diamonds. After all, everything has come right in the end all
the other times."

So they filled all the pots they could find with flowers--asters and
zinnias, and loose-leaved late red roses from the wall of the
stableyard, till the house was a perfect bower.

And almost as soon as dinner was cleared away mother arrived, and was
clasped in eight loving arms. It was very difficult indeed not to tell
her all about the Psammead at once, because they had got into the habit
of telling her everything. But they did succeed in not telling her.

[Illustration: She was clasped in eight loving arms]

Mother, on her side, had plenty to tell them--about Granny, and Granny's
pigeons, and Auntie Emma's lame tame donkey. She was very delighted with
the flowery-boweryness of the house; and everything seemed so natural
and pleasant, now that she was home again, that the children almost
thought they must have dreamed the Psammead.

But, when mother moved towards the stairs to go up to her bedroom and
take off her bonnet, the eight arms clung round her just as if she only
had two children, one the Lamb and the other an octopus.

"Don't go up, mummy darling," said Anthea; "let me take your things up
for you."

"Or I will," said Cyril.

"We want you to come and look at the rose-tree," said Robert.

"Oh, don't go up!" said Jane helplessly.

"Nonsense, dears," said mother briskly, "I'm not such an old woman yet
that I can't take my bonnet off in the proper place. Besides I must wash
these black hands of mine."

So up she went, and the children, following her, exchanged glances of
gloomy foreboding.

Mother took off her bonnet,--it was a very pretty hat, really, with
white roses in it,--and when she had taken it off she went to the
dressing-table to do her pretty hair.

On the table between the ring-stand and the pin-cushion lay a green
leather case. Mother opened it.

"Oh, how lovely!" she cried. It was a ring, a large pearl with shining
many-lighted diamonds set round it. "Wherever did this come from?"
mother asked, trying it on her wedding finger, which it fitted
beautifully. "However did it come here?"

"I don't know," said each of the children truthfully.

"Father must have told Martha to put it here," mother said. "I'll run
down and ask her."

"Let me look at it," said Anthea, who knew Martha would not be able to
see the ring. But when Martha was asked, of course she denied putting
the ring there, and so did Eliza and cook.

Mother came back to her bedroom, very much interested and pleased about
the ring. But, when she opened the dressing-table drawer and found a
long case containing an almost priceless diamond necklace, she was more
interested still, though not so pleased. In the wardrobe, when she went
to put away her "bonnet," she found a tiara and several brooches, and
the rest of the jewellery turned up in various parts of the room during
the next half-hour. The children looked more and more uncomfortable, and
now Jane began to sniff.

Mother looked at her gravely.

"Jane," she said, "I am sure you know something about this. Now think
before you speak, and tell me the truth."

"We found a Fairy," said Jane obediently.

[Illustration: "We found a Fairy," said Jane obediently]

"No nonsense, please," said her mother sharply.

"Don't be silly, Jane," Cyril interrupted. Then he went on desperately.
"Look here, mother, we've never seen the things before, but Lady
Chittenden at Peasmarsh Place lost all her jewellery by wicked burglars
last night. Could this possibly be it?"

All drew a deep breath. They were saved.

"But how could they have put it here? And why should they?" asked
mother, not unreasonably. "Surely it would have been easier and safer to
make off with it?"

"Suppose," said Cyril, "they thought it better to wait for--for
sunset--nightfall, I mean, before they went off with it. No one but us
knew that you were coming back to-day."

"I must send for the police at once," said mother distractedly. "Oh, how
I wish daddy were here!"

"Wouldn't it be better to wait till he _does_ come?" asked Robert,
knowing that his father would not be home before sunset.

"No, no; I can't wait a minute with all this on my mind," cried mother.
"All this" was the heap of jewel-cases on the bed. They put them all in
the wardrobe, and mother locked it. Then mother called Martha.

"Martha," she said, "has any stranger been into my room since I've been
away? Now, answer me truthfully."

"No, mum," answered Martha; "leastways, what I mean to say"--

She stopped.

"Come," said her mistress kindly, "I see someone has. You must tell me
at once. Don't be frightened. I'm sure _you_ haven't done anything
wrong."

Martha burst into heavy sobs.

"I was a-goin' to give you warning this very day, mum, to leave at the
end of my month, so I was,--on account of me being going to make a
respectable young man happy. A gamekeeper he is by trade, mum--and I
wouldn't deceive you--of the name of Beale. And it's as true as I stand
here, it was your coming home in such a hurry, and no warning given, out
of the kindness of his heart it was, as he says, 'Martha, my beauty,' he
says,--which I ain't, and never was, but you know how them men will go
on,--'I can't see you a-toiling and a-moiling and not lend a 'elping
'and; which mine is a strong arm, and it's yours Martha, my dear,' says
he. And so he helped me a-cleanin' of the windows--but outside, mum, the
whole time, and me in; if I never say another breathing word it's gospel
truth."

"Were you with him the whole time?" asked her mistress.

"Him outside and me in, I was," said Martha; "except for fetching up a
fresh pail and the leather that that slut of a Eliza'd hidden away
behind the mangle."

"That will do," said the children's mother. "I am not pleased with you,
Martha, but you have spoken the truth, and that counts for something."

When Martha had gone, the children clung round their mother.

"Oh, mummy darling," cried Anthea, "it isn't Beale's fault, it isn't
really! He's a great dear; he is, truly and honourably, and as honest as
the day. Don't let the police take him, mummy! Oh, don't, don't, don't!"

It was truly awful. Here was an innocent man accused of robbery through
that silly wish of Jane's, and it was absolutely useless to tell the
truth. All longed to, but they thought of the straws in the hair and the
shrieks of the other frantic maniacs, and they could not do it.

"Is there a cart hereabouts?" asked the mother feverishly. "A trap of
any sort? I must drive in to Rochester and tell the police at once."

All the children sobbed, "There's a cart at the farm, but, oh, don't
go!--don't go!--oh, don't go!--wait till daddy comes home!"

Mother took not the faintest notice. When she had set her mind on a
thing she always went straight through with it; she was rather like
Anthea in this respect.

"Look here, Cyril," she said, sticking on her hat with long sharp
violet-headed pins, "I leave you in charge. Stay in the dressing-room.
You can pretend to be swimming boats in the bath, or something. Say I
gave you leave. But stay there, with the door on the landing open; I've
locked the other. And don't let anyone go into my room. Remember, no one
knows the jewels are there except me, and all of you, and the wicked
thieves who put them there. Robert, you stay in the garden and watch the
windows. If anyone tries to get in you must run and tell the two farm
men that I'll send up to wait in the kitchen. I'll tell them there are
dangerous characters about--that's true enough. Now remember, I trust
you both. But I don't think they'll try it till after dark, so you're
quite safe. Good-bye, darlings."

And she locked her bedroom door and went off with the key in her pocket.

The children could not help admiring the dashing and decided way in
which she had acted. They thought how useful she would have been in
organising escape from some of the tight places in which they had found
themselves of late in consequence of their ill-timed wishes.

"She's a born general," said Cyril,--"but _I_ don't know what's going to
happen to us. Even if the girls were to hunt for that old Sammyadd and
find it, and get it to take the jewels away again, mother would only
think we hadn't looked out properly and let the burglars sneak in and
get them--or else the police will think _we've_ got them--or else that
she's been fooling them. Oh, it's a pretty decent average ghastly mess
this time, and no mistake!"

He savagely made a paper boat and began to float it in the bath, as he
had been told to do.

Robert went into the garden and sat down on the worn yellow grass, with
his miserable head between his helpless hands.

Anthea and Jane whispered together in the passage downstairs, where the
cocoanut matting was--with the hole in it that you always caught your
foot in if you were not careful. Martha's voice could be heard in the
kitchen,--grumbling loud and long.

"It's simply quite too dreadfully awful," said Anthea. "How do you know
all the diamonds are there, too? If they aren't, the police will think
mother and father have got them, and that they've only given up some of
them for a kind of desperate blind. And they'll be put in prison, and we
shall be branded outcasts, the children of felons. And it won't be at
all nice for father and mother either," she added, by a candid
after-thought.

"But what can we _do_?" asked Jane.

"Nothing--at least we might look for the Psammead again. It's a very,
_very_ hot day. He may have come out to warm that whisker of his."

"He won't give us any more beastly wishes to-day," said Jane flatly. "He
gets crosser and crosser every time we see him. I believe he hates
having to give wishes."

Anthea had been shaking her head gloomily--now she stopped shaking it so
suddenly that it really looked as though she were pricking up her ears.

"What is it?" asked Jane. "Oh, have you thought of something?"

"Our one chance," cried Anthea dramatically; "the last lone-lorn forlorn
hope. Come on."

At a brisk trot she led the way to the sand-pit. Oh, joy!--there was the
Psammead, basking in a golden sandy hollow and preening its whiskers
happily in the glowing afternoon sun. The moment it saw them it whisked
round and began to burrow--it evidently preferred its own company to
theirs. But Anthea was too quick for it. She caught it by its furry
shoulders gently but firmly, and held it.

"Here--none of that!" said the Psammead. "Leave go of me, will you?"

But Anthea held him fast.

"Dear kind darling Sammyadd," she said breathlessly.

"Oh yes--it's all very well," it said; "you want another wish, I expect.
But I can't keep on slaving from morning till night giving people their
wishes. I must have _some_ time to myself."

"Do you hate giving wishes?" asked Anthea gently, and her voice trembled
with excitement.

"Of course I do," it said. "Leave go of me or I'll bite!--I really
will--I mean it. Oh, well, if you choose to risk it."

Anthea risked it and held on.

"Look here," she said, "don't bite me--listen to reason. If you'll only
do what we want to-day, we'll never ask you for another wish as long as
we live."

The Psammead was much moved.

"I'd do anything," it said in a tearful voice. "I'd almost burst myself
to give you one wish after another, as long as I held out, if you'd only
never, never ask me to do it after to-day. If you knew how I hate to
blow myself out with other people's wishes, and how frightened I am
always that I shall strain a muscle or something. And then to wake up
every morning and know you've _got_ to do it. You don't know what it
is--you don't know what it is, you don't!" Its voice cracked with
emotion, and the last "don't" was a squeak.

Anthea set it down gently on the sand.

"It's all over now," she said soothingly. "We promise faithfully never
to ask for another wish after to-day."

"Well, go ahead," said the Psammead; "let's get it over."

"How many can you do?"

"I don't know--as long as I can hold out."

"Well, first, I wish Lady Chittenden may find she's never lost her
jewels."

The Psammead blew itself out, collapsed, and said, "Done."

"I wish," said Anthea more slowly, "mother mayn't get to the police."

"Done," said the creature after the proper interval.

"I wish," said Jane suddenly, "mother could forget all about the
diamonds."

"Done," said the Psammead; but its voice was weaker.

"Would you like to rest a little?" asked Anthea considerately.

"Yes, please," said the Psammead; "and, before we go any further, will
you wish something for me?"

"Can't you do wishes for yourself?"

"Of course not," it said; "we were always expected to give each other
our wishes--not that we had any to speak of in the good old Megatherium
days. Just wish, will you, that you may never be able, any of you, to
tell anyone a word about _Me_."

"Why?" asked Jane.

"Why, don't you see, if you told grown-ups I should have no peace of my
life. They'd get hold of me, and they wouldn't wish silly things like
you do, but real earnest things; and the scientific people would hit on
some way of making things last after sunset, as likely as not; and
they'd ask for a graduated income-tax, and old-age pensions, and manhood
suffrage, and free secondary education, and dull things like that; and
get them, and keep them, and the whole world would be turned
topsy-turvy. Do wish it! Quick!"

Anthea repeated the Psammead's wish, and it blew itself out to a larger
size than they had yet seen it attain.

"And now," it said as it collapsed, "can I do anything more for you?"

"Just one thing; and I think that clears everything up, doesn't it,
Jane? I wish Martha to forget about the diamond ring, and mother to
forget about the keeper cleaning the windows."

"It's like the 'Brass Bottle,'" said Jane.

"Yes, I'm glad we read that or I should never have thought of it."

"Now," said the Psammead faintly, "I'm almost worn out. Is there
anything else?"

"No; only thank you kindly for all you've done for us, and I hope you'll
have a good long sleep, and I hope we shall see you again some day."

"Is that a wish?" it said in a weak voice.

"Yes, please," said the two girls together.

[Illustration: It burrowed, and disappeared, scratching fiercely to the
last]

Then for the last time in this story they saw the Psammead blow itself
out and collapse suddenly. It nodded to them, blinked its long snail's
eyes, burrowed, and disappeared, scratching fiercely to the last, and
the sand closed over it.

       *       *       *       *       *

"I hope we've done right?" said Jane.

"I'm sure we have," said Anthea. "Come on home and tell the boys."

Anthea found Cyril glooming over his paper boats, and told him. Jane
told Robert. The two tales were only just ended when mother walked in,
hot and dusty. She explained that as she was being driven into Rochester
to buy the girls' autumn school-dresses the axle had broken, and but for
the narrowness of the lane and the high soft hedges she would have been
thrown out. As it was, she was not hurt, but she had had to walk home.
"And oh, my dearest dear chicks," she said, "I am simply dying for a cup
of tea! Do run and see if the water boils!"

"So you see it's all right," Jane whispered. "She doesn't remember."

"No more does Martha," said Anthea, who had been to ask after the state
of the kettle.

As the servants sat at their tea, Beale the gamekeeper dropped in. He
brought the welcome news that Lady Chittenden's diamonds had not been
lost at all. Lord Chittenden had taken them to be re-set and cleaned,
and the maid who knew about it had gone for a holiday. So that was all
right.

"I wonder if we ever shall see the Psammead again," said Jane wistfully
as they walked in the garden, while mother was putting the Lamb to bed.

"I'm sure we shall," said Cyril, "if you really wished it."

"We've promised never to ask it for another wish," said Anthea.

"I never want to," said Robert earnestly.

They did see it again, of course, but not in this story. And it was not
in a sand-pit either, but in a very, very, very different place. It was
in a---- But I must say no more.

CHAPTER 1. THE JUNGLE



Children are like jam: all very well in the proper place, but you can’t
stand them all over the shop--eh, what?’

These were the dreadful words of our Indian uncle. They made us feel
very young and angry; and yet we could not be comforted by calling him
names to ourselves, as you do when nasty grown-ups say nasty things,
because he is not nasty, but quite the exact opposite when not
irritated. And we could not think it ungentlemanly of him to say we were
like jam, because, as Alice says, jam is very nice indeed--only not on
furniture and improper places like that. My father said, ‘Perhaps they
had better go to boarding-school.’ And that was awful, because we know
Father disapproves of boarding-schools. And he looked at us and said, ‘I
am ashamed of them, sir!’

Your lot is indeed a dark and terrible one when your father is ashamed
of you. And we all knew this, so that we felt in our chests just as if
we had swallowed a hard-boiled egg whole. At least, this is what
Oswald felt, and Father said once that Oswald, as the eldest, was the
representative of the family, so, of course, the others felt the same.

And then everybody said nothing for a short time. At last Father said--

‘You may go--but remember--’

The words that followed I am not going to tell you. It is no use telling
you what you know before--as they do in schools. And you must all have
had such words said to you many times. We went away when it was over.
The girls cried, and we boys got out books and began to read, so that
nobody should think we cared. But we felt it deeply in our interior
hearts, especially Oswald, who is the eldest and the representative of
the family.

We felt it all the more because we had not really meant to do anything
wrong. We only thought perhaps the grown-ups would not be quite pleased
if they knew, and that is quite different. Besides, we meant to put all
the things back in their proper places when we had done with them before
anyone found out about it. But I must not anticipate (that means telling
the end of the story before the beginning. I tell you this because it is
so sickening to have words you don’t know in a story, and to be told to
look it up in the dicker).

We are the Bastables--Oswald, Dora, Dicky, Alice, Noel, and H. O. If you
want to know why we call our youngest brother H. O. you can jolly well
read The Treasure Seekers and find out. We were the Treasure Seekers,
and we sought it high and low, and quite regularly, because we
particularly wanted to find it. And at last we did not find it, but
we were found by a good, kind Indian uncle, who helped Father with his
business, so that Father was able to take us all to live in a jolly big
red house on Blackheath, instead of in the Lewisham Road, where we lived
when we were only poor but honest Treasure Seekers. When we were poor
but honest we always used to think that if only Father had plenty of
business, and we did not have to go short of pocket money and wear
shabby clothes (I don’t mind this myself, but the girls do), we should
be happy and very, very good.

And when we were taken to the beautiful big Blackheath house we
thought now all would be well, because it was a house with vineries and
pineries, and gas and water, and shrubberies and stabling, and replete
with every modern convenience, like it says in Dyer & Hilton’s list
of Eligible House Property. I read all about it, and I have copied the
words quite right.

It is a beautiful house, all the furniture solid and strong, no casters
off the chairs, and the tables not scratched, and the silver not dented;
and lots of servants, and the most decent meals every day--and lots of
pocket-money.

But it is wonderful how soon you get used to things, even the things you
want most. Our watches, for instance. We wanted them frightfully; but
when I had mine a week or two, after the mainspring got broken and was
repaired at Bennett’s in the village, I hardly cared to look at the
works at all, and it did not make me feel happy in my heart any more,
though, of course, I should have been very unhappy if it had been taken
away from me. And the same with new clothes and nice dinners and having
enough of everything. You soon get used to it all, and it does not make
you extra happy, although, if you had it all taken away, you would be
very dejected. (That is a good word, and one I have never used before.)
You get used to everything, as I said, and then you want something more.
Father says this is what people mean by the deceitfulness of riches; but
Albert’s uncle says it is the spirit of progress, and Mrs Leslie said
some people called it ‘divine discontent’. Oswald asked them all what
they thought one Sunday at dinner. Uncle said it was rot, and what we
wanted was bread and water and a licking; but he meant it for a joke.
This was in the Easter holidays.

We went to live at the Red House at Christmas. After the holidays the
girls went to the Blackheath High School, and we boys went to the Prop.
(that means the Proprietary School). And we had to swot rather during
term; but about Easter we knew the deceitfulness of riches in the vac.,
when there was nothing much on, like pantomimes and things. Then there
was the summer term, and we swotted more than ever; and it was boiling
hot, and masters’ tempers got short and sharp, and the girls used to
wish the exams came in cold weather. I can’t think why they don’t. But
I suppose schools don’t think of sensible thinks like that. They teach
botany at girls’ schools.

Then the Midsummer holidays came, and we breathed again--but only for a
few days. We began to feel as if we had forgotten something, and did not
know what it was. We wanted something to happen--only we didn’t exactly
know what. So we were very pleased when Father said--

‘I’ve asked Mr Foulkes to send his children here for a week or two. You
know--the kids who came at Christmas. You must be jolly to them, and see
that they have a good time, don’t you know.’

We remembered them right enough--they were little pinky, frightened
things, like white mice, with very bright eyes. They had not been to our
house since Christmas, because Denis, the boy, had been ill, and they
had been with an aunt at Ramsgate.

Alice and Dora would have liked to get the bedrooms ready for the
honoured guests, but a really good housemaid is sometimes more ready to
say ‘Don’t’ than even a general. So the girls had to chuck it. Jane only
let them put flowers in the pots on the visitors’ mantelpieces, and then
they had to ask the gardener which kind they might pick, because nothing
worth gathering happened to be growing in our own gardens just then.

Their train got in at 12.27. We all went to meet them. Afterwards I
thought that was a mistake, because their aunt was with them, and she
wore black with beady things and a tight bonnet, and she said, when we
took our hats off--‘Who are you?’ quite crossly.

We said, ‘We are the Bastables; we’ve come to meet Daisy and Denny.’

The aunt is a very rude lady, and it made us sorry for Daisy and Denny
when she said to them--

‘Are these the children? Do you remember them?’ We weren’t very tidy,
perhaps, because we’d been playing brigands in the shrubbery; and we
knew we should have to wash for dinner as soon as we got back, anyhow.
But still--

Denny said he thought he remembered us. But Daisy said, ‘Of course they
are,’ and then looked as if she was going to cry.

So then the aunt called a cab, and told the man where to drive, and put
Daisy and Denny in, and then she said--

‘You two little girls may go too, if you like, but you little boys must
walk.’

So the cab went off, and we were left. The aunt turned to us to say a
few last words. We knew it would have been about brushing your hair and
wearing gloves, so Oswald said, ‘Good-bye’, and turned haughtily away,
before she could begin, and so did the others. No one but that kind
of black beady tight lady would say ‘little boys’. She is like Miss
Murdstone in David Copperfield. I should like to tell her so; but she
would not understand. I don’t suppose she has ever read anything but
Markham’s History and Mangnall’s Questions--improving books like that.

When we got home we found all four of those who had ridden in the cab
sitting in our sitting-room--we don’t call it nursery now--looking very
thoroughly washed, and our girls were asking polite questions and the
others were saying ‘Yes’ and ‘No’, and ‘I don’t know’. We boys did not
say anything. We stood at the window and looked out till the gong
went for our dinner. We felt it was going to be awful--and it was. The
newcomers would never have done for knight-errants, or to carry the
Cardinal’s sealed message through the heart of France on a horse; they
would never have thought of anything to say to throw the enemy off the
scent when they got into a tight place.

They said ‘Yes, please’, and ‘No, thank you’; and they ate very neatly,
and always wiped their mouths before they drank, as well as after, and
never spoke with them full.

And after dinner it got worse and worse.

We got out all our books and they said ‘Thank you’, and didn’t look at
them properly. And we got out all our toys, and they said ‘Thank you,
it’s very nice’ to everything. And it got less and less pleasant, and
towards teatime it came to nobody saying anything except Noel and H.
O.--and they talked to each other about cricket.

After tea Father came in, and he played ‘Letters’ with them and the
girls, and it was a little better; but while late dinner was going on--I
shall never forget it. Oswald felt like the hero of a book--‘almost
at the end of his resources’. I don’t think I was ever glad of bedtime
before, but that time I was.

When they had gone to bed (Daisy had to have all her strings and buttons
undone for her, Dora told me, though she is nearly ten, and Denny said
he couldn’t sleep without the gas being left a little bit on) we held
a council in the girls’ room. We all sat on the bed--it is a mahogany
fourposter with green curtains very good for tents, only the housekeeper
doesn’t allow it, and Oswald said--

‘This is jolly nice, isn’t it?’

‘They’ll be better to-morrow,’ Alice said, ‘they’re only shy.’

Dicky said shy was all very well, but you needn’t behave like a perfect
idiot.

‘They’re frightened. You see we’re all strange to them,’ Dora said.

‘We’re not wild beasts or Indians; we shan’t eat them. What have they
got to be frightened of?’ Dicky said this.

Noel told us he thought they were an enchanted prince and princess who’d
been turned into white rabbits, and their bodies had got changed back
but not their insides.

But Oswald told him to dry up.

‘It’s no use making things up about them,’ he said. ‘The thing is:
what are we going to DO? We can’t have our holidays spoiled by these
snivelling kids.’

‘No,’ Alice said, ‘but they can’t possibly go on snivelling for ever.
Perhaps they’ve got into the habit of it with that Murdstone aunt. She’s
enough to make anyone snivel.’

‘All the same,’ said Oswald, ‘we jolly well aren’t going to have another
day like today. We must do something to rouse them from their snivelling
leth--what’s its name?--something sudden and--what is it?--decisive.’

‘A booby trap,’ said H. O., ‘the first thing when they get up, and an
apple-pie bed at night.’

But Dora would not hear of it, and I own she was right.

‘Suppose,’ she said, ‘we could get up a good play--like we did when we
were Treasure Seekers.’

We said, well what? But she did not say.

‘It ought to be a good long thing--to last all day,’ Dicky said, ‘and if
they like they can play, and if they don’t--’

‘If they don’t, I’ll read to them,’ Alice said.

But we all said ‘No, you don’t--if you begin that way you’ll have to go
on.’

And Dicky added, ‘I wasn’t going to say that at all. I was going to say
if they didn’t like it they could jolly well do the other thing.’

We all agreed that we must think of something, but we none of us could,
and at last the council broke up in confusion because Mrs Blake--she is
the housekeeper--came up and turned off the gas.

But next morning when we were having breakfast, and the two strangers
were sitting there so pink and clean, Oswald suddenly said--

‘I know; we’ll have a jungle in the garden.’

And the others agreed, and we talked about it till brek was over. The
little strangers only said ‘I don’t know’ whenever we said anything to
them.

After brekker Oswald beckoned his brothers and sisters mysteriously
apart and said--

‘Do you agree to let me be captain today, because I thought of it?’

And they said they would.

Then he said, ‘We’ll play Jungle Book, and I shall be Mowgli. The rest
of you can be what you like--Mowgli’s father and mother, or any of the
beasts.’

‘I don’t suppose they know the book,’ said Noel. ‘They don’t look as if
they read anything, except at lesson times.’

‘Then they can go on being beasts all the time,’ Oswald said. ‘Anyone
can be a beast.’

So it was settled.

And now Oswald--Albert’s uncle has sometimes said he is clever at
arranging things--began to lay his plans for the jungle. The day was
indeed well chosen. Our Indian uncle was away; Father was away; Mrs
Blake was going away, and the housemaid had an afternoon off. Oswald’s
first conscious act was to get rid of the white mice--I mean the little
good visitors. He explained to them that there would be a play in the
afternoon, and they could be what they liked, and gave them the Jungle
Book to read the stories he told them to--all the ones about Mowgli.
He led the strangers to a secluded spot among the sea-kale pots in the
kitchen garden and left them. Then he went back to the others, and we
had a jolly morning under the cedar talking about what we would do when
Blakie was gone. She went just after our dinner.

When we asked Denny what he would like to be in the play, it turned out
he had not read the stories Oswald told him at all, but only the ‘White
Seal’ and ‘Rikki Tikki’.

We then agreed to make the jungle first and dress up for our parts
afterwards. Oswald was a little uncomfortable about leaving the
strangers alone all the morning, so he said Denny should be his
aide-de-camp, and he was really quite useful. He is rather handy with
his fingers, and things that he does up do not come untied. Daisy might
have come too, but she wanted to go on reading, so we let her, which is
the truest manners to a visitor. Of course the shrubbery was to be the
jungle, and the lawn under the cedar a forest glade, and then we began
to collect the things. The cedar lawn is just nicely out of the way of
the windows. It was a jolly hot day--the kind of day when the sunshine
is white and the shadows are dark grey, not black like they are in the
evening.

We all thought of different things. Of course first we dressed up
pillows in the skins of beasts and set them about on the grass to look
as natural as we could. And then we got Pincher, and rubbed him all
over with powdered slate-pencil, to make him the right colour for Grey
Brother. But he shook it all off, and it had taken an awful time to do.
Then Alice said--

‘Oh, I know!’ and she ran off to Father’s dressing-room, and came back
with the tube of creme d’amande pour la barbe et les mains, and we
squeezed it on Pincher and rubbed it in, and then the slate-pencil stuff
stuck all right, and he rolled in the dust-bin of his own accord, which
made him just the right colour. He is a very clever dog, but soon after
he went off and we did not find him till quite late in the afternoon.
Denny helped with Pincher, and with the wild-beast skins, and when
Pincher was finished he said--

‘Please, may I make some paper birds to put in the trees? I know how.’

And of course we said ‘Yes’, and he only had red ink and newspapers, and
quickly he made quite a lot of large paper birds with red tails. They
didn’t look half bad on the edge of the shrubbery.

While he was doing this he suddenly said, or rather screamed, ‘Oh?’

And we looked, and it was a creature with great horns and a fur
rug--something like a bull and something like a minotaur--and I don’t
wonder Denny was frightened. It was Alice, and it was first-class.

Up to now all was not yet lost beyond recall. It was the stuffed fox
that did the mischief--and I am sorry to own it was Oswald who thought
of it. He is not ashamed of having THOUGHT of it. That was rather clever
of him. But he knows now that it is better not to take other people’s
foxes and things without asking, even if you live in the same house with
them.

It was Oswald who undid the back of the glass case in the hall and got
out the fox with the green and grey duck in its mouth, and when the
others saw how awfully like life they looked on the lawn, they all
rushed off to fetch the other stuffed things. Uncle has a tremendous
lot of stuffed things. He shot most of them himself--but not the fox, of
course. There was another fox’s mask, too, and we hung that in a bush to
look as if the fox was peeping out. And the stuffed birds we fastened on
to the trees with string. The duck-bill--what’s its name?--looked very
well sitting on his tail with the otter snarling at him. Then Dicky had
an idea; and though not nearly so much was said about it afterwards as
there was about the stuffed things, I think myself it was just as bad,
though it was a good idea, too. He just got the hose and put the end
over a branch of the cedar-tree. Then we got the steps they clean
windows with, and let the hose rest on the top of the steps and run. It
was to be a waterfall, but it ran between the steps and was only wet and
messy; so we got Father’s mackintosh and uncle’s and covered the steps
with them, so that the water ran down all right and was glorious, and it
ran away in a stream across the grass where we had dug a little channel
for it--and the otter and the duck-bill-thing were as if in their native
haunts. I hope all this is not very dull to read about. I know it was
jolly good fun to do. Taking one thing with another, I don’t know that
we ever had a better time while it lasted.

We got all the rabbits out of the hutches and put pink paper tails on
to them, and hunted them with horns made out of The Times. They got away
somehow, and before they were caught next day they had eaten a good
many lettuces and other things. Oswald is very sorry for this. He rather
likes the gardener.

Denny wanted to put paper tails on the guinea-pigs, and it was no use
our telling him there was nothing to tie the paper on to. He thought we
were kidding until we showed him, and then he said, ‘Well, never mind’,
and got the girls to give him bits of the blue stuff left over from
their dressing-gowns.

‘I’ll make them sashes to tie round their little middles,’ he said. And
he did, and the bows stuck up on the tops of their backs. One of the
guinea-pigs was never seen again, and the same with the tortoise when we
had done his shell with vermilion paint. He crawled away and returned no
more. Perhaps someone collected him and thought he was an expensive kind
unknown in these cold latitudes.

The lawn under the cedar was transformed into a dream of beauty,
what with the stuffed creatures and the paper-tailed things and the
waterfall. And Alice said--

‘I wish the tigers did not look so flat.’ For of course with pillows you
can only pretend it is a sleeping tiger getting ready to make a spring
out at you. It is difficult to prop up tiger-skins in a life-like manner
when there are no bones inside them, only pillows and sofa cushions.

‘What about the beer-stands?’ I said. And we got two out of the cellar.
With bolsters and string we fastened insides to the tigers--and they
were really fine. The legs of the beer-stands did for tigers’ legs. It
was indeed the finishing touch.

Then we boys put on just our bathing drawers and vests--so as to be able
to play with the waterfall without hurting our clothes. I think this was
thoughtful. The girls only tucked up their frocks and took their shoes
and stockings off. H. O. painted his legs and his hands with Condy’s
fluid--to make him brown, so that he might be Mowgli, although Oswald
was captain and had plainly said he was going to be Mowgli himself. Of
course the others weren’t going to stand that. So Oswald said--

‘Very well. Nobody asked you to brown yourself like that. But now you’ve
done it, you’ve simply got to go and be a beaver, and live in the dam
under the waterfall till it washes off.’

He said he didn’t want to be beavers. And Noel said--

‘Don’t make him. Let him be the bronze statue in the palace gardens that
the fountain plays out of.’

So we let him have the hose and hold it up over his head. It made a
lovely fountain, only he remained brown. So then Dicky and Oswald and
I did ourselves brown too, and dried H. O. as well as we could with our
handkerchiefs, because he was just beginning to snivel. The brown did
not come off any of us for days.

Oswald was to be Mowgli, and we were just beginning to arrange the
different parts. The rest of the hose that was on the ground was Kaa,
the Rock Python, and Pincher was Grey Brother, only we couldn’t find
him. And while most of us were talking, Dicky and Noel got messing about
with the beer-stand tigers.

And then a really sad event instantly occurred, which was not really our
fault, and we did not mean to.

That Daisy girl had been mooning indoors all the afternoon with the
Jungle Books, and now she came suddenly out, just as Dicky and Noel had
got under the tigers and were shoving them along to fright each other.
Of course, this is not in the Mowgli book at all: but they did look
jolly like real tigers, and I am very far from wishing to blame the
girl, though she little knew what would be the awful consequence of her
rash act. But for her we might have got out of it all much better than
we did. What happened was truly horrid.

As soon as Daisy saw the tigers she stopped short, and uttering a shriek
like a railway whistle she fell flat on the ground.

‘Fear not, gentle Indian maid,’ Oswald cried, thinking with surprise
that perhaps after all she did know how to play, ‘I myself will protect
thee.’ And he sprang forward with the native bow and arrows out of
uncle’s study.

The gentle Indian maiden did not move.

‘Come hither,’ Dora said, ‘let us take refuge in yonder covert while
this good knight does battle for us.’ Dora might have remembered that we
were savages, but she did not. And that is Dora all over. And still the
Daisy girl did not move.

Then we were truly frightened. Dora and Alice lifted her up, and her
mouth was a horrid violet-colour and her eyes half shut. She looked
horrid. Not at all like fair fainting damsels, who are always of an
interesting pallor. She was green, like a cheap oyster on a stall.

We did what we could, a prey to alarm as we were. We rubbed her hands
and let the hose play gently but perseveringly on her unconscious brow.
The girls loosened her dress, though it was only the kind that comes
down straight without a waist. And we were all doing what we could as
hard as we could, when we heard the click of the front gate. There was
no mistake about it.

‘I hope whoever it is will go straight to the front door,’ said Alice.
But whoever it was did not. There were feet on the gravel, and there was
the uncle’s voice, saying in his hearty manner--

‘This way. This way. On such a day as this we shall find our young
barbarians all at play somewhere about the grounds.’

And then, without further warning, the uncle, three other gentlemen and
two ladies burst upon the scene.

We had no clothes on to speak of--I mean us boys. We were all wet
through. Daisy was in a faint or a fit, or dead, none of us then knew
which. And all the stuffed animals were there staring the uncle in the
face. Most of them had got a sprinkling, and the otter and the duck-bill
brute were simply soaked. And three of us were dark brown. Concealment,
as so often happens, was impossible.

The quick brain of Oswald saw, in a flash, exactly how it would strike
the uncle, and his brave young blood ran cold in his veins. His heart
stood still.

‘What’s all this--eh, what?’ said the tones of the wronged uncle.

Oswald spoke up and said it was jungles we were playing, and he didn’t
know what was up with Daisy. He explained as well as anyone could, but
words were now in vain.

The uncle had a Malacca cane in his hand, and we were but ill prepared
to meet the sudden attack. Oswald and H. O. caught it worst. The other
boys were under the tigers--and of course my uncle would not strike a
girl. Denny was a visitor and so got off.

But it was bread and water for us for the next three days, and our own
rooms. I will not tell you how we sought to vary the monotonousness of
imprisonment. Oswald thought of taming a mouse, but he could not find
one. The reason of the wretched captives might have given way but for
the gutter that you can crawl along from our room to the girls’. But
I will not dwell on this because you might try it yourselves, and it
really is dangerous. When my father came home we got the talking to,
and we said we were sorry--and we really were--especially about Daisy,
though she had behaved with muffishness, and then it was settled that
we were to go into the country and stay till we had grown into better
children.

Albert’s uncle was writing a book in the country; we were to go to his
house. We were glad of this--Daisy and Denny too. This we bore nobly. We
knew we had deserved it. We were all very sorry for everything, and we
resolved that for the future we WOULD be good.

I am not sure whether we kept this resolution or not. Oswald thinks now
that perhaps we made a mistake in trying so very hard to be good all at
once. You should do everything by degrees.

P.S.--It turned out Daisy was not really dead at all. It was only
fainting--so like a girl.


N.B.--Pincher was found on the drawing-room sofa.


Appendix.--I have not told you half the things we did for the
jungle--for instance, about the elephants’ tusks and the horse-hair
sofa-cushions, and uncle’s fishing-boots.



CHAPTER 2. THE WOULDBEGOODS

When we were sent down into the country to learn to be good we felt
it was rather good business, because we knew our being sent there was
really only to get us out of the way for a little while, and we knew
right enough that it wasn’t a punishment, though Mrs Blake said it was,
because we had been punished thoroughly for taking the stuffed animals
out and making a jungle on the lawn with them, and the garden hose. And
you cannot be punished twice for the same offence. This is the English
law; at least I think so. And at any rate no one would punish you three
times, and we had had the Malacca cane and the solitary confinement; and
the uncle had kindly explained to us that all ill-feeling between him
and us was wiped out entirely by the bread and water we had endured. And
what with the bread and water and being prisoners, and not being able
to tame any mice in our prisons, I quite feel that we had suffered it up
thoroughly, and now we could start fair.

I think myself that descriptions of places are generally dull, but I
have sometimes thought that was because the authors do not tell you what
you truly want to know. However, dull or not, here goes--because you
won’t understand anything unless I tell you what the place was like.

The Moat House was the one we went to stay at. There has been a house
there since Saxon times. It is a manor, and a manor goes on having a
house on it whatever happens. The Moat House was burnt down once or
twice in ancient centuries--I don’t remember which--but they always
built a new one, and Cromwell’s soldiers smashed it about, but it was
patched up again. It is a very odd house: the front door opens straight
into the dining-room, and there are red curtains and a black-and-white
marble floor like a chess-board, and there is a secret staircase, only
it is not secret now--only rather rickety. It is not very big, but there
is a watery moat all round it with a brick bridge that leads to the
front door. Then, on the other side of the moat there is the farm, with
barns and oast houses and stables, or things like that. And the other
way the garden lawn goes on till it comes to the churchyard. The
churchyard is not divided from the garden at all except by a little
grass bank. In the front of the house there is more garden, and the big
fruit garden is at the back.

The man the house belongs to likes new houses, so he built a big one
with conservatories and a stable with a clock in a turret on the top,
and he left the Moat House. And Albert’s uncle took it, and my father
was to come down sometimes from Saturday to Monday, and Albert’s uncle
was to live with us all the time, and he would be writing a book, and we
were not to bother him, but he would give an eye to us. I hope all this
is plain. I have said it as short as I can.

We got down rather late, but there was still light enough to see the
big bell hanging at the top of the house. The rope belonging to it went
right down the house, through our bedroom to the dining-room. H. O. saw
the rope and pulled it while he was washing his hands for supper, and
Dicky and I let him, and the bell tolled solemnly. Father shouted to him
not to, and we went down to supper.

But presently there were many feet trampling on the gravel, and Father
went out to see. When he came back he said--‘The whole village, or half
of it, has come up to see why the bell rang. It’s only rung for fire or
burglars. Why can’t you kids let things alone?’

Albert’s uncle said--

‘Bed follows supper as the fruit follows the flower. They’ll do no more
mischief to-night, sir. To-morrow I will point out a few of the things
to be avoided in this bucolic retreat.’

So it was bed directly after supper, and that was why we did not see
much that night.

But in the morning we were all up rather early, and we seemed to have
awakened in a new world rich in surprises beyond the dreams of anybody,
as it says in the quotation.

We went everywhere we could in the time, but when it was breakfast-time
we felt we had not seen half or a quarter. The room we had breakfast
in was exactly like in a story--black oak panels and china in corner
cupboards with glass doors. These doors were locked. There were green
curtains, and honeycomb for breakfast. After brekker my father went back
to town, and Albert’s uncle went too, to see publishers. We saw them to
the station, and Father gave us a long list of what we weren’t to do. It
began with ‘Don’t pull ropes unless you’re quite sure what will happen
at the other end,’ and it finished with ‘For goodness sake, try to keep
out of mischief till I come down on Saturday’. There were lots of other
things in between.

We all promised we would. And we saw them off and waved till the train
was quite out of sight. Then we started to walk home. Daisy was tired so
Oswald carried her home on his back. When we got home she said--

‘I do like you, Oswald.’

She is not a bad little kid; and Oswald felt it was his duty to be nice
to her because she was a visitor. Then we looked all over everything.
It was a glorious place. You did not know where to begin. We were all
a little tired before we found the hayloft, but we pulled ourselves
together to make a fort with the trusses of hay--great square
things--and we were having a jolly good time, all of us, when suddenly a
trap-door opened and a head bobbed up with a straw in its mouth. We knew
nothing about the country then, and the head really did scare us rather,
though, of course, we found out directly that the feet belonging to it
were standing on the bar of the loose-box underneath. The head said--

‘Don’t you let the governor catch you a-spoiling of that there hay,
that’s all.’ And it spoke thickly because of the straw.

It is strange to think how ignorant you were in the past. We can hardly
believe now that once we really did not know that it spoiled hay to mess
about with it. Horses don’t like to eat it afterwards.

Always remember this.

When the head had explained a little more it went away, and we turned
the handle of the chaff-cutting machine, and nobody got hurt, though the
head HAD said we should cut our fingers off if we touched it.

And then we sat down on the floor, which is dirty with the nice clean
dirt that is more than half chopped hay, and those there was room for
hung their legs down out of the top door, and we looked down at the
farmyard, which is very slushy when you get down into it, but most
interesting.

Then Alice said--

‘Now we’re all here, and the boys are tired enough to sit still for a
minute, I want to have a council.’

We said what about? And she said, ‘I’ll tell you.’ H. O., don’t wriggle
so; sit on my frock if the straws tickle your legs.’

You see he wears socks, and so he can never be quite as comfortable as
anyone else.

‘Promise not to laugh’ Alice said, getting very red, and looking at
Dora, who got red too.

We did, and then she said:

‘Dora and I have talked this over, and Daisy too, and we have written it
down because it is easier than saying it. Shall I read it? or will you,
Dora?’

Dora said it didn’t matter; Alice might. So Alice read it, and though
she gabbled a bit we all heard it. I copied it afterwards. This is what
she read:


     NEW SOCIETY FOR BEING GOOD IN

‘I, Dora Bastable, and Alice Bastable, my sister, being of sound mind
and body, when we were shut up with bread and water on that jungle day,
we thought a great deal about our naughty sins, and we made our minds up
to be good for ever after. And we talked to Daisy about it, and she had
an idea. So we want to start a society for being good in. It is Daisy’s
idea, but we think so too.’

‘You know,’ Dora interrupted, ‘when people want to do good things they
always make a society. There are thousands--there’s the Missionary
Society.’

‘Yes,’ Alice said, ‘and the Society for the Prevention of something or
other, and the Young Men’s Mutual Improvement Society, and the S.P.G.’

‘What’s S.P.G.?’ Oswald asked.

‘Society for the Propagation of the Jews, of course,’ said Noel, who
cannot always spell.

‘No, it isn’t; but do let me go on.’

Alice did go on.

‘We propose to get up a society, with a chairman and a treasurer and
secretary, and keep a journal-book saying what we’ve done. If that
doesn’t make us good it won’t be my fault.

‘The aim of the society is nobleness and goodness, and great and
unselfish deeds. We wish not to be such a nuisance to grown-up people
and to perform prodigies of real goodness. We wish to spread our
wings’--here Alice read very fast. She told me afterwards Daisy had
helped her with that part, and she thought when she came to the wings
they sounded rather silly--‘to spread our wings and rise above the kind
of interesting things that you ought not to do, but to do kindnesses to
all, however low and mean.’


Denny was listening carefully. Now he nodded three or four times.

     ‘Little words of kindness’ (he said),
     ‘Little deeds of love,
     Make this earth an eagle
     Like the one above.’

This did not sound right, but we let it pass, because an eagle does have
wings, and we wanted to hear the rest of what the girls had written. But
there was no rest.

‘That’s all,’ said Alice, and Daisy said--‘Don’t you think it’s a good
idea?’

‘That depends,’ Oswald answered, ‘who is president and what you mean by
being good.’

Oswald did not care very much for the idea himself, because being
good is not the sort of thing he thinks it is proper to talk about,
especially before strangers. But the girls and Denny seemed to like
it, so Oswald did not say exactly what he thought, especially as it was
Daisy’s idea. This was true politeness.

‘I think it would be nice,’ Noel said, ‘if we made it a sort of play.
Let’s do the Pilgrim’s Progress.’

We talked about that for some time, but it did not come to anything,
because we all wanted to be Mr Greatheart, except H. O., who wanted to
be the lions, and you could not have lions in a Society for Goodness.

Dicky said he did not wish to play if it meant reading books about
children who die; he really felt just as Oswald did about it, he told me
afterwards. But the girls were looking as if they were in Sunday school,
and we did not wish to be unkind.

At last Oswald said, ‘Well, let’s draw up the rules of the society, and
choose the president and settle the name.’

Dora said Oswald should be president, and he modestly consented. She was
secretary, and Denny treasurer if we ever had any money.

Making the rules took us all the afternoon. They were these:


               RULES

1. Every member is to be as good as possible.

2. There is to be no more jaw than necessary about being good.
(Oswald and Dicky put that rule in.)

3. No day must pass without our doing some kind action to a suffering
fellow-creature.

4. We are to meet every day, or as often as we like.

5. We are to do good to people we don’t like as often as we can.

6. No one is to leave the Society without the consent of all the
rest of us.

7. The Society is to be kept a profound secret from all the world
except us.

8. The name of our Society is--

And when we got as far as that we all began to talk at once. Dora wanted
it called the Society for Humane Improvement; Denny said the Society for
Reformed Outcast Children; but Dicky said, No, we really were not so bad
as all that.

Then H. O. said, ‘Call it the Good Society.’

‘Or the Society for Being Good In,’ said Daisy.

‘Or the Society of Goods,’ said Noel.

‘That’s priggish,’ said Oswald; ‘besides, we don’t know whether we shall
be so very.’

‘You see,’ Alice explained, ‘we only said if we COULD we would be good.’

‘Well, then,’ Dicky said, getting up and beginning to dust the chopped
hay off himself, ‘call it the Society of the Wouldbegoods and have done
with it.’

Oswald thinks Dicky was getting sick of it and wanted to make himself
a little disagreeable. If so, he was doomed to disappointment. For
everyone else clapped hands and called out, ‘That’s the very thing!’
Then the girls went off to write out the rules, and took H. O. with
them, and Noel went to write some poetry to put in the minute book.
That’s what you call the book that a society’s secretary writes what it
does in. Denny went with him to help. He knows a lot of poetry. I think
he went to a lady’s school where they taught nothing but that. He was
rather shy of us, but he took to Noel. I can’t think why. Dicky and
Oswald walked round the garden and told each other what they thought of
the new society.

‘I’m not sure we oughtn’t to have put our foot down at the beginning,’
Dicky said. ‘I don’t see much in it, anyhow.’

‘It pleases the girls,’ Oswald said, for he is a kind brother.

‘But we’re not going to stand jaw, and “words in season”, and “loving
sisterly warnings”. I tell you what it is, Oswald, we’ll have to run
this thing our way, or it’ll be jolly beastly for everybody.’

Oswald saw this plainly.

‘We must do something,’ Dicky said; ‘it’s very very hard, though. Still,
there must be SOME interesting things that are not wrong.’

‘I suppose so,’ Oswald said, ‘but being good is so much like being a
muff, generally. Anyhow I’m not going to smooth the pillows of the sick,
or read to the aged poor, or any rot out of Ministering Children.’

‘No more am I,’ Dicky said. He was chewing a straw like the head had
in its mouth, ‘but I suppose we must play the game fair. Let’s begin by
looking out for something useful to do--something like mending things or
cleaning them, not just showing off.’

‘The boys in books chop kindling wood and save their pennies to buy tea
and tracts.’

‘Little beasts!’ said Dick. ‘I say, let’s talk about something
else.’ And Oswald was glad to, for he was beginning to feel jolly
uncomfortable.

We were all rather quiet at tea, and afterwards Oswald played draughts
with Daisy and the others yawned. I don’t know when we’ve had such a
gloomy evening. And everyone was horribly polite, and said ‘Please’ and
‘Thank you’ far more than requisite.

Albert’s uncle came home after tea. He was jolly, and told us stories,
but he noticed us being a little dull, and asked what blight had fallen
on our young lives. Oswald could have answered and said, ‘It is the
Society of the Wouldbegoods that is the blight,’ but of course he didn’t
and Albert’s uncle said no more, but he went up and kissed the girls
when they were in bed, and asked them if there was anything wrong. And
they told him no, on their honour.

The next morning Oswald awoke early. The refreshing beams of the morning
sun shone on his narrow white bed and on the sleeping forms of his dear
little brothers and Denny, who had got the pillow on top of his head and
was snoring like a kettle when it sings. Oswald could not remember
at first what was the matter with him, and then he remembered the
Wouldbegoods, and wished he hadn’t. He felt at first as if there was
nothing you could do, and even hesitated to buzz a pillow at Denny’s
head. But he soon saw that this could not be. So he chucked his boot and
caught Denny right in the waistcoat part, and thus the day began more
brightly than he had expected.

Oswald had not done anything out of the way good the night before,
except that when no one was looking he polished the brass candlestick in
the girls’ bedroom with one of his socks. And he might just as well have
let it alone, for the servants cleaned it again with the other things in
the morning, and he could never find the sock afterwards. There were two
servants. One of them had to be called Mrs Pettigrew instead of Jane and
Eliza like others. She was cook and managed things.

After breakfast Albert’s uncle said--

‘I now seek the retirement of my study. At your peril violate my
privacy before 1.30 sharp. Nothing short of bloodshed will warrant the
intrusion, and nothing short of man--or rather boy--slaughter shall
avenge it.’

So we knew he wanted to be quiet, and the girls decided that we ought to
play out of doors so as not to disturb him; we should have played out of
doors anyhow on a jolly fine day like that.

But as we were going out Dicky said to Oswald--

‘I say, come along here a minute, will you?’

So Oswald came along, and Dicky took him into the other parlour and shut
the door, and Oswald said--

‘Well, spit it out: what is it?’ He knows that is vulgar, and he would
not have said it to anyone but his own brother. Dicky said--

‘It’s a pretty fair nuisance. I told you how it would be.’ And Oswald
was patient with him, and said--

‘What is? Don’t be all day about it.’

Dicky fidgeted about a bit, and then he said--

‘Well, I did as I said. I looked about for something useful to do. And
you know that dairy window that wouldn’t open--only a little bit like
that? Well, I mended the catch with wire and whip cord and it opened
wide.’

‘And I suppose they didn’t want it mended,’ said Oswald. He knew but too
well that grown-up people sometimes like to keep things far different
from what we would, and you catch it if you try to do otherwise.

‘I shouldn’t have minded THAT,’ Dicky said, ‘because I could easily have
taken it all off again if they’d only said so. But the sillies went and
propped up a milk-pan against the window. They never took the trouble to
notice I had mended it. So the wretched thing pushed the window open all
by itself directly they propped it up, and it tumbled through into the
moat, and they are most awfully waxy. All the men are out in the fields
and they haven’t any spare milk-pans. If I were a farmer, I must say
I wouldn’t stick at an extra milk-pan or two. Accidents must happen
sometimes. I call it mean.’

Dicky spoke in savage tones. But Oswald was not so unhappy, first
because it wasn’t his fault, and next because he is a far-seeing boy.

‘Never mind,’ he said kindly. ‘Keep your tail up. We’ll get the beastly
milk-pan out all right. Come on.’ He rushed hastily to the garden and
gave a low, signifying whistle, which the others know well enough to
mean something extra being up.

And when they were all gathered round him he spoke.

‘Fellow countrymen,’ he said, ‘we’re going to have a rousing good time.’

‘It’s nothing naughty, is it,’ Daisy asked, ‘like the last time you had
that was rousingly good?’

Alice said ‘Shish’, and Oswald pretended not to hear.

‘A precious treasure,’ he said, ‘has inadvertently been laid low in the
moat by one of us.’

‘The rotten thing tumbled in by itself,’ Dicky said.

Oswald waved his hand and said, ‘Anyhow, it’s there. It’s our duty to
restore it to its sorrowing owners. I say, look here--we’re going to
drag the moat.’

Everyone brightened up at this. It was our duty and it was interesting
too. This is very uncommon.

So we went out to where the orchard is, at the other side of the moat.
There were gooseberries and things on the bushes, but we did not take
any till we had asked if we might. Alice went and asked. Mrs Pettigrew
said, ‘Law! I suppose so; you’d eat ‘em anyhow, leave or no leave.’

She little knows the honourable nature of the house of Bastable. But she
has much to learn.

The orchard slopes gently down to the dark waters of the moat. We sat
there in the sun and talked about dragging the moat, till Denny said,
‘How DO you drag moats?’

And we were speechless, because, though we had read many times about a
moat being dragged for missing heirs and lost wills, we really had never
thought about exactly how it was done.

‘Grappling-irons are right, I believe,’ Denny said, ‘but I don’t suppose
they’d have any at the farm.’

And we asked, and found they had never even heard of them. I think
myself he meant some other word, but he was quite positive.

So then we got a sheet off Oswald’s bed, and we all took our shoes and
stockings off, and we tried to see if the sheet would drag the bottom
of the moat, which is shallow at that end. But it would keep floating
on the top of the water, and when we tried sewing stones into one end
of it, it stuck on something in the bottom, and when we got it up it was
torn. We were very sorry, and the sheet was in an awful mess; but the
girls said they were sure they could wash it in the basin in their room,
and we thought as we had torn it anyway, we might as well go on. That
washing never came off.

‘No human being,’ Noel said, ‘knows half the treasures hidden in this
dark tarn.’

And we decided we would drag a bit more at that end, and work gradually
round to under the dairy window where the milk-pan was. We could not see
that part very well, because of the bushes that grow between the cracks
of the stones where the house goes down into the moat. And opposite the
dairy window the barn goes straight down into the moat too. It is like
pictures of Venice; but you cannot get opposite the dairy window anyhow.

We got the sheet down again when we had tied the torn parts together in
a bunch with string, and Oswald was just saying--

‘Now then, my hearties, pull together, pull with a will! One, two,
three,’ when suddenly Dora dropped her bit of the sheet with a piercing
shriek and cried out--

‘Oh! it’s all wormy at the bottom. I felt them wriggle.’ And she was out
of the water almost before the words were out of her mouth.

The other girls all scuttled out too, and they let the sheet go in such
a hurry that we had no time to steady ourselves, and one of us went
right in, and the rest got wet up to our waistbands. The one who went
right in was only H. O.; but Dora made an awful fuss and said it was our
fault. We told her what we thought, and it ended in the girls going in
with H. O. to change his things. We had some more gooseberries while
they were gone. Dora was in an awful wax when she went away, but she is
not of a sullen disposition though sometimes hasty, and when they all
came back we saw it was all right, so we said--

‘What shall we do now?’

Alice said, ‘I don’t think we need drag any more. It is wormy. I felt it
when Dora did. And besides, the milk-pan is sticking a bit of itself out
of the water. I saw it through the dairy window.’

‘Couldn’t we get it up with fish-hooks?’ Noel said. But Alice explained
that the dairy was now locked up and the key taken out. So then Oswald
said--

‘Look here, we’ll make a raft. We should have to do it some time, and
we might as well do it now. I saw an old door in that corner stable that
they don’t use. You know. The one where they chop the wood.’

We got the door.

We had never made a raft, any of us, but the way to make rafts is better
described in books, so we knew what to do.

We found some nice little tubs stuck up on the fence of the farm garden,
and nobody seemed to want them for anything just then, so we took them.
Denny had a box of tools someone had given him for his last birthday;
they were rather rotten little things, but the gimlet worked all right,
so we managed to make holes in the edges of the tubs and fasten them
with string under the four corners of the old door. This took us a long
time. Albert’s uncle asked us at dinner what we had been playing at, and
we said it was a secret, and it was nothing wrong. You see we wished to
atone for Dicky’s mistake before anything more was said. The house has
no windows in the side that faces the orchard.

The rays of the afternoon sun were beaming along the orchard grass when
at last we launched the raft. She floated out beyond reach with the last
shove of the launching. But Oswald waded out and towed her back; he is
not afraid of worms. Yet if he had known of the other things that were
in the bottom of that moat he would have kept his boots on. So would the
others, especially Dora, as you will see.

At last the gallant craft rode upon the waves. We manned her, though not
up to our full strength, because if more than four got on the water came
up too near our knees, and we feared she might founder if over-manned.

Daisy and Denny did not want to go on the raft, white mice that they
were, so that was all right. And as H. O. had been wet through once he
was not very keen. Alice promised Noel her best paint-brush if he’d give
up and not go, because we knew well that the voyage was fraught with
deep dangers, though the exact danger that lay in wait for us under the
dairy window we never even thought of.

So we four elder ones got on the raft very carefully; and even then,
every time we moved the water swished up over the raft and hid our feet.
But I must say it was a jolly decent raft.

Dicky was captain, because it was his adventure. We had hop-poles from
the hop-garden beyond the orchard to punt with. We made the girls stand
together in the middle and hold on to each other to keep steady. Then
we christened our gallant vessel. We called it the Richard, after Dicky,
and also after the splendid admiral who used to eat wine-glasses and
died after the Battle of the Revenge in Tennyson’s poetry.

Then those on shore waved a fond adieu as well as they could with the
dampness of their handkerchiefs, which we had had to use to dry our legs
and feet when we put on our stockings for dinner, and slowly and stately
the good ship moved away from shore, riding on the waves as though they
were her native element.

We kept her going with the hop-poles, and we kept her steady in the same
way, but we could not always keep her steady enough, and we could not
always keep her in the wind’s eye. That is to say, she went where we did
not want, and once she bumped her corner against the barn wall, and
all the crew had to sit down suddenly to avoid falling overboard into a
watery grave. Of course then the waves swept her decks, and when we got
up again we said that we should have to change completely before tea.

But we pressed on undaunted, and at last our saucy craft came into port,
under the dairy window and there was the milk-pan, for whose sake we
had endured such hardships and privations, standing up on its edge quite
quietly.

The girls did not wait for orders from the captain, as they ought to
have done; but they cried out, ‘Oh, here it is!’ and then both reached
out to get it. Anyone who has pursued a naval career will see that of
course the raft capsized. For a moment it felt like standing on the roof
of the house, and the next moment the ship stood up on end and shot the
whole crew into the dark waters.

We boys can swim all right. Oswald has swum three times across the
Ladywell Swimming Baths at the shallow end, and Dicky is nearly as good;
but just then we did not think of this; though, of course, if the water
had been deep we should have.

As soon as Oswald could get the muddy water out of his eyes he opened
them on a horrid scene.

Dicky was standing up to his shoulders in the inky waters; the raft had
righted itself, and was drifting gently away towards the front of the
house, where the bridge is, and Dora and Alice were rising from the
deep, with their hair all plastered over their faces--like Venus in the
Latin verses.

There was a great noise of splashing. And besides that a feminine voice,
looking out of the dairy window and screaming--

‘Lord love the children!’

It was Mrs Pettigrew. She disappeared at once, and we were sorry we
were in such a situation that she would be able to get at Albert’s uncle
before we could. Afterwards we were not so sorry.

Before a word could be spoken about our desperate position Dora
staggered a little in the water, and suddenly shrieked, ‘Oh, my foot!
oh, it’s a shark! I know it is--or a crocodile!’

The others on the bank could hear her shrieking, but they could not
see us properly; they did not know what was happening. Noel told me
afterwards he never could care for that paint-brush.

Of course we knew it could not be a shark, but I thought of pike, which
are large and very angry always, and I caught hold of Dora. She screamed
without stopping. I shoved her along to where there was a ledge of
brickwork, and shoved her up, till she could sit on it, then she got her
foot out of the water, still screaming.

It was indeed terrible. The thing she thought was a shark came up with
her foot, and it was a horrid, jagged, old meat-tin, and she had put
her foot right into it. Oswald got it off, and directly he did so blood
began to pour from the wounds. The tin edges had cut it in several
spots. It was very pale blood, because her foot was wet, of course.

She stopped screaming, and turned green, and I thought she was going to
faint, like Daisy did on the jungle day.

Oswald held her up as well as he could, but it really was one of the
least agreeable moments in his life. For the raft was gone, and she
couldn’t have waded back anyway, and we didn’t know how deep the moat
might be in other places.

But Mrs Pettigrew had not been idle. She is not a bad sort really.

Just as Oswald was wondering whether he could swim after the raft and
get it back, a boat’s nose shot out from under a dark archway a little
further up under the house. It was the boathouse, and Albert’s uncle had
got the punt and took us back in it. When we had regained the dark arch
where the boat lives we had to go up the cellar stairs. Dora had to be
carried.

There was but little said to us that day. We were sent to bed--those who
had not been on the raft the same as the others, for they owned up all
right, and Albert’s uncle is the soul of justice.

Next day but one was Saturday. Father gave us a talking to--with other
things.

The worst was when Dora couldn’t get her shoe on, so they sent for the
doctor, and Dora had to lie down for ever so long. It was indeed poor
luck.

When the doctor had gone Alice said to me--

‘It IS hard lines, but Dora’s very jolly about it. Daisy’s been telling
her about how we should all go to her with our little joys and sorrows
and things, and about the sweet influence from a sick bed that can be
felt all over the house, like in What Katy Did, and Dora said she hoped
she might prove a blessing to us all while she’s laid up.’

Oswald said he hoped so, but he was not pleased. Because this sort
of jaw was exactly the sort of thing he and Dicky didn’t want to have
happen.

The thing we got it hottest for was those little tubs off the garden
railings. They turned out to be butter-tubs that had been put out there
‘to sweeten’.

But as Denny said, ‘After the mud in that moat not all the perfumes of
somewhere or other could make them fit to use for butter again.’

I own this was rather a bad business. Yet we did not do it to please
ourselves, but because it was our duty. But that made no difference to
our punishment when Father came down. I have known this mistake occur
before.



CHAPTER 3. BILL’S TOMBSTONE

There were soldiers riding down the road, on horses two and two. That
is the horses were two and two, and the men not. Because each man was
riding one horse and leading another. To exercise them. They came from
Chatham Barracks. We all drew up in a line outside the churchyard wall,
and saluted as they went by, though we had not read Toady Lion then. We
have since. It is the only decent book I have ever read written by Toady
Lion’s author. The others are mere piffle. But many people like them. In
Sir Toady Lion the officer salutes the child.

There was only a lieutenant with those soldiers, and he did not salute
me. He kissed his hand to the girls; and a lot of the soldiers behind
kissed theirs too. We waved ours back.

Next day we made a Union Jack out of pocket-handkerchiefs and part of a
red flannel petticoat of the White Mouse’s, which she did not want just
then, and some blue ribbon we got at the village shop.

Then we watched for the soldiers, and after three days they went by
again, by twos and twos as before. It was A1.

We waved our flag, and we shouted. We gave them three cheers. Oswald can
shout loudest. So as soon as the first man was level with us (not the
advance guard, but the first of the battery)--he shouted--

‘Three cheers for the Queen and the British Army!’ And then we waved the
flag, and bellowed. Oswald stood on the wall to bellow better, and Denny
waved the flag because he was a visitor, and so politeness made us let
him enjoy the fat of whatever there was going.

The soldiers did not cheer that day; they only grinned and kissed their
hands.

The next day we all got up as much like soldiers as we could. H. O. and
Noel had tin swords, and we asked Albert’s uncle to let us wear some of
the real arms that are on the wall in the dining-room.

And he said, ‘Yes’, if we would clean them up afterwards. But we
jolly well cleaned them up first with Brooke’s soap and brick dust and
vinegar, and the knife polish (invented by the great and immortal Duke
of Wellington in his spare time when he was not conquering Napoleon.
Three cheers for our Iron Duke!), and with emery paper and wash leather
and whitening. Oswald wore a cavalry sabre in its sheath. Alice and the
Mouse had pistols in their belts, large old flint-locks, with bits
of red flannel behind the flints. Denny had a naval cutlass, a very
beautiful blade, and old enough to have been at Trafalgar. I hope
it was. The others had French sword-bayonets that were used in the
Franco-German war. They are very bright when you get them bright, but
the sheaths are hard to polish. Each sword-bayonet has the name on the
blade of the warrior who once wielded it. I wonder where they are now.
Perhaps some of them died in the war. Poor chaps! But it is a very long
time ago.

I should like to be a soldier. It is better than going to the best
schools, and to Oxford afterwards, even if it is Balliol you go to.
Oswald wanted to go to South Africa for a bugler, but father would not
let him. And it is true that Oswald does not yet know how to bugle,
though he can play the infantry ‘advance’, and the ‘charge’ and the
‘halt’ on a penny whistle. Alice taught them to him with the piano, out
of the red book Father’s cousin had when he was in the Fighting Fifth.
Oswald cannot play the ‘retire’, and he would scorn to do so. But I
suppose a bugler has to play what he is told, no matter how galling to
the young boy’s proud spirit.

The next day, being thoroughly armed, we put on everything red, white
and blue that we could think of--night-shirts are good for white, and
you don’t know what you can do with red socks and blue jerseys till you
try--and we waited by the churchyard wall for the soldiers. When the
advance guard (or whatever you call it of artillery--it’s that for
infantry, I know) came by, we got ready, and when the first man of the
first battery was level with us Oswald played on his penny whistle the
‘advance’ and the ‘charge’--and then shouted--

‘Three cheers for the Queen and the British Army!’ This time they had
the guns with them. And every man of the battery cheered too. It was
glorious. It made you tremble all over. The girls said it made them
want to cry--but no boy would own to this, even if it were true. It is
babyish to cry. But it was glorious, and Oswald felt differently to what
he ever did before.

Then suddenly the officer in front said, ‘Battery! Halt!’ and all the
soldiers pulled their horses up, and the great guns stopped too. Then
the officer said, ‘Sit at ease,’ and something else, and the sergeant
repeated it, and some of the men got off their horses and lit their
pipes, and some sat down on the grass edge of the road, holding their
horses’ bridles.

We could see all the arms and accoutrements as plain as plain.

Then the officer came up to us. We were all standing on the wall that
day, except Dora, who had to sit, because her foot was bad, but we let
her have the three-edged rapier to wear, and the blunderbuss to hold as
well--it has a brass mouth and is like in Mr Caldecott’s pictures.

He was a beautiful man the officer. Like a Viking. Very tall and fair,
with moustaches very long, and bright blue eyes. He said--

‘Good morning.’

So did we.

Then he said--

‘You seem to be a military lot.’

We said we wished we were.

‘And patriotic,’ said he.

Alice said she should jolly well think so.

Then he said he had noticed us there for several days, and he had halted
the battery because he thought we might like to look at the guns.

Alas! there are but too few grown-up people so far-seeing and thoughtful
as this brave and distinguished officer.

We said, ‘Oh, yes’, and then we got off the wall, and that good
and noble man showed us the string that moves the detonator and the
breech-block (when you take it out and carry it away the gun is in vain
to the enemy, even if he takes it); and he let us look down the gun to
see the rifling, all clean and shiny--and he showed us the ammunition
boxes, but there was nothing in them. He also told us how the gun was
unlimbered (this means separating the gun from the ammunition carriage),
and how quick it could be done--but he did not make the men do this
then, because they were resting. There were six guns. Each had painted
on the carriage, in white letters, 15 Pr., which the captain told us
meant fifteen-pounder.

‘I should have thought the gun weighed more than fifteen pounds,’ Dora
said. ‘It would if it was beef, but I suppose wood and gun are lighter.’

And the officer explained to her very kindly and patiently that 15 Pr.
meant the gun could throw a SHELL weighing fifteen pounds.

When we had told him how jolly it was to see the soldiers go by so
often, he said--

‘You won’t see us many more times. We’re ordered to the front; and we
sail on Tuesday week; and the guns will be painted mud-colour, and the
men will wear mud-colour too, and so shall I.’

The men looked very nice, though they were not wearing their busbies,
but only Tommy caps, put on all sorts of ways.

We were very sorry they were going, but Oswald, as well as others,
looked with envy on those who would soon be allowed--being grown up, and
no nonsense about your education--to go and fight for their Queen and
country.

Then suddenly Alice whispered to Oswald, and he said--

‘All right; but tell him yourself.’

So Alice said to the captain--

‘Will you stop next time you pass?’

He said, ‘I’m afraid I can’t promise that.’

Alice said, ‘You might; there’s a particular reason.’

He said, ‘What?’ which was a natural remark; not rude, as it is with
children. Alice said--

‘We want to give the soldiers a keepsake and will write to ask my
father. He is very well off just now. Look here--if we’re not on the
wall when you come by, don’t stop; but if we are, please, PLEASE do!’

The officer pulled his moustache and looked as if he did not know;
but at last he said ‘Yes’, and we were very glad, though but Alice and
Oswald knew the dark but pleasant scheme at present fermenting in their
youthful nuts.

The captain talked a lot to us. At last Noel said--

‘I think you are like Diarmid of the Golden Collar. But I should like to
see your sword out, and shining in the sun like burnished silver.’

The captain laughed and grasped the hilt of his good blade. But Oswald
said hurriedly--

‘Don’t. Not yet. We shan’t ever have a chance like this. If you’d only
show us the pursuing practice! Albert’s uncle knows it; but he only does
it on an armchair, because he hasn’t a horse.’

And that brave and swagger captain did really do it. He rode his horse
right into our gate when we opened it, and showed us all the cuts,
thrusts, and guards. There are four of each kind. It was splendid. The
morning sun shone on his flashing blade, and his good steed stood with
all its legs far apart and stiff on the lawn.

Then we opened the paddock gate, and he did it again, while the horse
galloped as if upon the bloody battlefield among the fierce foes of his
native land, and this was far more ripping still.

Then we thanked him very much, and he went away, taking his men with
him. And the guns of course.

Then we wrote to my father, and he said ‘Yes’, as we knew he would, and
next time the soldiers came by--but they had no guns this time, only
the captive Arabs of the desert--we had the keepsakes ready in a
wheelbarrow, and we were on the churchyard wall.

And the bold captain called an immediate halt.

Then the girls had the splendid honour and pleasure of giving a pipe and
four whole ounces of tobacco to each soldier.

Then we shook hands with the captain, and the sergeant and the
corporals, and the girls kissed the captain--I can’t think why girls
will kiss everybody--and we all cheered for the Queen. It was grand. And
I wish my father had been there to see how much you can do with L12 if
you order the things from the Stores.

We have never seen those brave soldiers again.

I have told you all this to show you how we got so keen about soldiers,
and why we sought to aid and abet the poor widow at the white cottage in
her desolate and oppressedness.

Her name was Simpkins, and her cottage was just beyond the churchyard,
on the other side from our house. On the different military occasions
which I have remarked upon this widow woman stood at her garden gate and
looked on. And after the cheering she rubbed her eyes with her apron.
Alice noticed this slight but signifying action.

We feel quite sure Mrs Simpkins liked soldiers, and so we felt friendly
to her. But when we tried to talk to her she would not. She told us to
go along with us, do, and not bother her. And Oswald, with his usual
delicacy and good breeding, made the others do as she said.

But we were not to be thus repulsed with impunity. We made complete but
cautious inquiries, and found out that the reason she cried when she saw
soldiers was that she had only one son, a boy. He was twenty-two, and he
had gone to the War last April. So that she thought of him when she saw
the soldiers, and that was why she cried. Because when your son is at
the wars you always think he is being killed. I don’t know why. A great
many of them are not. If I had a son at the wars I should never think
he was dead till I heard he was, and perhaps not then, considering
everything. After we had found this out we held a council.

Dora said, ‘We must do something for the soldier’s widowed mother.’

We all agreed, but added ‘What?’

Alice said, ‘The gift of money might be deemed an insult by that proud,
patriotic spirit. Besides, we haven’t more than eighteenpence among us.’

We had put what we had to father’s L12 to buy the baccy and pipes.

The Mouse then said, ‘Couldn’t we make her a flannel petticoat and leave
it without a word upon her doorstep?’

But everyone said, ‘Flannel petticoats in this weather?’ so that was no
go.

Noel said he would write her a poem, but Oswald had a deep, inward
feeling that Mrs Simpkins would not understand poetry. Many people do
not.

H. O. said, ‘Why not sing “Rule Britannia” under her window after she
had gone to bed, like waits,’ but no one else thought so.

Denny thought we might get up a subscription for her among the wealthy
and affluent, but we said again that we knew money would be no balm to
the haughty mother of a brave British soldier.

‘What we want,’ Alice said, ‘is something that will be a good deal of
trouble to us and some good to her.’

‘A little help is worth a deal of poetry,’ said Denny.

I should not have said that myself. Noel did look sick.

‘What DOES she do that we can help in?’ Dora asked. ‘Besides, she won’t
let us help.’

H. O. said, ‘She does nothing but work in the garden. At least if she
does anything inside you can’t see it, because she keeps the door shut.’

Then at once we saw. And we agreed to get up the very next day, ere
yet the rosy dawn had flushed the east, and have a go at Mrs Simpkins’s
garden.

We got up. We really did. But too often when you mean to, overnight,
it seems so silly to do it when you come to waking in the dewy morn. We
crept downstairs with our boots in our hands. Denny is rather unlucky,
though a most careful boy. It was he who dropped his boot, and it went
blundering down the stairs, echoing like thunderbolts, and waking up
Albert’s uncle. But when we explained to him that we were going to do
some gardening he let us, and went back to bed.

Everything is very pretty and different in the early morning, before
people are up. I have been told this is because the shadows go a
different way from what they do in the awake part of the day. But I
don’t know. Noel says the fairies have just finished tidying up then.
Anyhow it all feels quite otherwise.

We put on our boots in the porch, and we got our gardening tools and we
went down to the white cottage. It is a nice cottage, with a thatched
roof, like in the drawing copies you get at girls’ schools, and you
do the thatch--if you can--with a B.B. pencil. If you cannot, you just
leave it. It looks just as well, somehow, when it is mounted and framed.

We looked at the garden. It was very neat. Only one patch was coming up
thick with weeds. I could see groundsel and chickweed, and others that I
did not know. We set to work with a will. We used all our tools--spades,
forks, hoes, and rakes--and Dora worked with the trowel, sitting down,
because her foot was hurt. We cleared the weedy patch beautifully,
scraping off all the nasty weeds and leaving the nice clean brown dirt.
We worked as hard as ever we could. And we were happy, because it was
unselfish toil, and no one thought then of putting it in the Book of
Golden Deeds, where we had agreed to write down our virtuous actions and
the good doings of each other, when we happen to notice them.

We had just done, and we were looking at the beautiful production of
our honest labour, when the cottage door burst open, and the soldier’s
widowed mother came out like a wild tornado, and her eyes looked like
upas trees--death to the beholder.

‘You wicked, meddlesome, nasty children!’ she said, ain’t you got enough
of your own good ground to runch up and spoil, but you must come into MY
little lot?’

Some of us were deeply alarmed, but we stood firm.

‘We have only been weeding your garden,’ Dora said; ‘we wanted to do
something to help you.’

‘Dratted little busybodies,’ she said. It was indeed hard, but everyone
in Kent says ‘dratted’ when they are cross. ‘It’s my turnips,’ she went
on, ‘you’ve hoed up, and my cabbages. My turnips that my boy sowed
afore he went. There, get along with you do, afore I come at you with my
broom-handle.’

She did come at us with her broom-handle as she spoke, and even the
boldest turned and fled. Oswald was even the boldest. ‘They looked like
weeds right enough,’ he said.

And Dicky said, ‘It all comes of trying to do golden deeds.’ This was
when we were out in the road.

As we went along, in a silence full of gloomy remorse, we met the
postman. He said--

‘Here’s the letters for the Moat,’ and passed on hastily. He was a bit
late.

When we came to look through the letters, which were nearly all for
Albert’s uncle, we found there was a postcard that had got stuck in a
magazine wrapper. Alice pulled it out. It was addressed to Mrs Simpkins.
We honourably only looked at the address, although it is allowed by the
rules of honourableness to read postcards that come to your house if you
like, even if they are not for you.

After a heated discussion, Alice and Oswald said they were not afraid,
whoever was, and they retraced their steps, Alice holding the postcard
right way up, so that we should not look at the lettery part of it, but
only the address.

With quickly-beating heart, but outwardly unmoved, they walked up to the
white cottage door.

It opened with a bang when we knocked.

‘Well?’ Mrs Simpkins said, and I think she said it what people in books
call ‘sourly’.

Oswald said, ‘We are very, very sorry we spoiled your turnips, and we
will ask my father to try and make it up to you some other way.’

She muttered something about not wanting to be beholden to anybody.

‘We came back,’ Oswald went on, with his always unruffled politeness,
‘because the postman gave us a postcard in mistake with our letters, and
it is addressed to you.’

‘We haven’t read it,’ Alice said quickly. I think she needn’t have said
that. Of course we hadn’t. But perhaps girls know better than we do what
women are likely to think you capable of.

The soldier’s mother took the postcard (she snatched it really, but
‘took’ is a kinder word, considering everything) and she looked at the
address a long time. Then she turned it over and read what was on the
back. Then she drew her breath in as far as it would go, and caught hold
of the door-post. Her face got awful. It was like the wax face of a dead
king I saw once at Madame Tussaud’s.

Alice understood. She caught hold of the soldier’s mother’s hand and
said--

‘Oh, NO--it’s NOT your boy Bill!’

And the woman said nothing, but shoved the postcard into Alice’s hand,
and we both read it--and it WAS her boy Bill.

Alice gave her back the card. She had held on to the woman’s hand all
the time, and now she squeezed the hand, and held it against her face.
But she could not say a word because she was crying so. The soldier’s
mother took the card again and she pushed Alice away, but it was not an
unkind push, and she went in and shut the door; and as Alice and Oswald
went down the road Oswald looked back, and one of the windows of the
cottage had a white blind. Afterwards the other windows had too. There
were no blinds really to the cottage. It was aprons and things she had
pinned up.

Alice cried most of the morning, and so did the other girls. We wanted
to do something for the soldier’s mother, but you can do nothing when
people’s sons are shot. It is the most dreadful thing to want to do
something for people who are unhappy, and not to know what to do.

It was Noel who thought of what we COIULD do at last.

He said, ‘I suppose they don’t put up tombstones to soldiers when they
die in war. But there--I mean Oswald said, ‘Of course not.’

Noel said, ‘I daresay you’ll think it’s silly, but I don’t care. Don’t
you think she’d like it, if we put one up to HIM? Not in the churchyard,
of course, because we shouldn’t be let, but in our garden, just where it
joins on to the churchyard?’

And we all thought it was a first-rate idea.

This is what we meant to put on the tombstone:


          ‘Here lies

          BILL SIMPKINS

     Who died fighting for Queen

          and Country.’


               ‘A faithful son,
               A son so dear,
               A soldier brave
               Lies buried here.’


Then we remembered that poor brave Bill was really buried far away in
the Southern hemisphere, if at all. So we altered it to--


               ‘A soldier brave
               We weep for here.’


Then we looked out a nice flagstone in the stable-yard, and we got a
cold chisel out of the Dentist’s toolbox, and began.

But stone-cutting is difficult and dangerous work.

Oswald went at it a bit, but he chipped his thumb, and it bled so he had
to chuck it. Then Dicky tried, and then Denny, but Dicky hammered his
finger, and Denny took all day over every stroke, so that by tea-time
we had only done the H, and about half the E--and the E was awfully
crooked. Oswald chipped his thumb over the H.

We looked at it the next morning, and even the most sanguinary of us saw
that it was a hopeless task.

Then Denny said, ‘Why not wood and paint?’ and he showed us how. We
got a board and two stumps from the carpenter’s in the village, and we
painted it all white, and when that was dry Denny did the words on it.

It was something like this:

          ‘IN MEMORY OF
          BILL SIMPKINS

     DEAD FOR QUEEN AND COUNTRY.

     HONOUR TO HIS NAME AND ALL

     OTHER BRAVE SOLDIERS.’


We could not get in what we meant to at first, so we had to give up the
poetry.

We fixed it up when it was dry. We had to dig jolly deep to get the
posts to stand up, but the gardener helped us.

Then the girls made wreaths of white flowers, roses and Canterbury
bells, and lilies and pinks, and sweet-peas and daisies, and put them
over the posts. And I think if Bill Simpkins had known how sorry we
were, he would have been glad. Oswald only hopes if he falls on the wild
battlefield, which is his highest ambition, that somebody will be as
sorry about him as he was about Bill, that’s all!

When all was done, and what flowers there were over from the wreaths
scattered under the tombstone between the posts, we wrote a letter to
Mrs Simpkins, and said--


DEAR MRS SIMPKINS--

We are very, very sorry about the turnips and things, and we beg your
pardon humbly. We have put up a tombstone to your brave son.


And we signed our names. Alice took the letter.

The soldier’s mother read it, and said something about our oughting to
know better than to make fun of people’s troubles with our tombstones
and tomfoolery.

Alice told me she could not help crying.

She said--

‘It’s not! it’s NOT! Dear, DEAR Mrs Simpkins, do come with me and see!
You don’t know how sorry we are about Bill. Do come and see.

We can go through the churchyard, and the others have all gone in, so as
to leave it quiet for you. Do come.’

And Mrs Simpkins did. And when she read what we had put up, and Alice
told her the verse we had not had room for, she leant against the wall
by the grave--I mean the tombstone--and Alice hugged her, and they both
cried bitterly. The poor soldier’s mother was very, very pleased, and
she forgave us about the turnips, and we were friends after that, but
she always liked Alice the best. A great many people do, somehow.

After that we used to put fresh flowers every day on Bill’s tombstone,
and I do believe his mother was pleased, though she got us to move it
away from the churchyard edge and put it in a corner of our garden under
a laburnum, where people could not see it from the church. But you could
from the road, though I think she thought you couldn’t. She came every
day to look at the new wreaths. When the white flowers gave out we put
coloured, and she liked it just as well.

About a fortnight after the erecting of the tombstone the girls were
putting fresh wreaths on it when a soldier in a red coat came down the
road, and he stopped and looked at us. He walked with a stick, and he
had a bundle in a blue cotton handkerchief, and one arm in a sling.

And he looked again, and he came nearer, and he leaned on the wall, so
that he could read the black printing on the white paint.

And he grinned all over his face, and he said--

‘Well, I AM blessed!’

And he read it all out in a sort of half whisper, and when he came to
the end, where it says, ‘and all such brave soldiers’, he said--

‘Well, I really AM!’ I suppose he meant he really was blessed. Oswald
thought it was like the soldier’s cheek, so he said--

‘I daresay you aren’t so very blessed as you think. What’s it to do with
you, anyway, eh, Tommy?’

Of course Oswald knew from Kipling that an infantry soldier is called
that. The soldier said--

‘Tommy yourself, young man. That’s ME!’ and he pointed to the tombstone.

We stood rooted to the spot. Alice spoke first.

‘Then you’re Bill, and you’re not dead,’ she said. ‘Oh, Bill, I am so
glad! Do let ME tell your mother.’

She started running, and so did we all. Bill had to go slowly because of
his leg, but I tell you he went as fast as ever he could.

We all hammered at the soldier’s mother’s door, and shouted--

‘Come out! come out!’ and when she opened the door we were going to
speak, but she pushed us away, and went tearing down the garden path
like winking. I never saw a grown-up woman run like it, because she saw
Bill coming.

She met him at the gate, running right into him, and caught hold of him,
and she cried much more than when she thought he was dead.

And we all shook his hand and said how glad we were.

The soldier’s mother kept hold of him with both hands, and I couldn’t
help looking at her face. It was like wax that had been painted on both
pink cheeks, and the eyes shining like candles. And when we had all said
how glad we were, she said--

‘Thank the dear Lord for His mercies,’ and she took her boy Bill into
the cottage and shut the door.

We went home and chopped up the tombstone with the wood-axe and had a
blazing big bonfire, and cheered till we could hardly speak.

The postcard was a mistake; he was only missing. There was a pipe and
a whole pound of tobacco left over from our keepsake to the other
soldiers. We gave it to Bill. Father is going to have him for
under-gardener when his wounds get well. He’ll always be a bit lame, so
he cannot fight any more.



CHAPTER 4. THE TOWER OF MYSTERY

It was very rough on Dora having her foot bad, but we took it in turns
to stay in with her, and she was very decent about it. Daisy was most
with her. I do not dislike Daisy, but I wish she had been taught how to
play. Because Dora is rather like that naturally, and sometimes I have
thought that Daisy makes her worse.

I talked to Albert’s uncle about it one day, when the others had gone to
church, and I did not go because of ear-ache, and he said it came
from reading the wrong sort of books partly--she has read Ministering
Children, and Anna Ross, or The Orphan of Waterloo, and Ready Work for
Willing Hands, and Elsie, or Like a Little Candle, and even a horrid
little blue book about the something or other of Little Sins. After this
conversation Oswald took care she had plenty of the right sort of books
to read, and he was surprised and pleased when she got up early one
morning to finish Monte Cristo. Oswald felt that he was really being
useful to a suffering fellow-creature when he gave Daisy books that were
not all about being good.

A few days after Dora was laid up, Alice called a council of the
Wouldbegoods, and Oswald and Dicky attended with darkly-clouded brows.
Alice had the minute-book, which was an exercise-book that had not much
written in it. She had begun at the other end. I hate doing that myself,
because there is so little room at the top compared with right way up.

Dora and a sofa had been carried out on to the lawn, and we were on the
grass. It was very hot and dry. We had sherbet. Alice read:

‘“Society of the Wouldbegoods.

‘“We have not done much. Dicky mended a window, and we got the milk-pan
out of the moat that dropped through where he mended it. Dora, Oswald,
Dicky and me got upset in the moat. This was not goodness. Dora’s foot
was hurt. We hope to do better next time.”’


Then came Noel’s poem:


     ‘We are the Wouldbegoods Society,
     We are not good yet, but we mean to try,
     And if we try, and if we don’t succeed,
     It must mean we are very bad indeed.’


This sounded so much righter than Noel’s poetry generally does, that
Oswald said so, and Noel explained that Denny had helped him.

‘He seems to know the right length for lines of poetry. I suppose it
comes of learning so much at school,’ Noel said.

Then Oswald proposed that anybody should be allowed to write in the
book if they found out anything good that anyone else had done, but not
things that were public acts; and nobody was to write about themselves,
or anything other people told them, only what they found out.

After a brief jaw the others agreed, and Oswald felt, not for the first
time in his young life, that he would have made a good diplomatic hero
to carry despatches and outwit the other side. For now he had put it
out of the minute-book’s power to be the kind of thing readers of
Ministering Children would have wished.

‘And if anyone tells other people any good thing he’s done he is to go
to Coventry for the rest of the day.’

And Denny remarked, ‘We shall do good by stealth, and blush to find it
shame.’

After that nothing was written in the book for some time. I looked
about, and so did the others, but I never caught anyone in the act of
doing anything extra; though several of the others have told me since of
things they did at this time, and really wondered nobody had noticed.

I think I said before that when you tell a story you cannot tell
everything. It would be silly to do it. Because ordinary kinds of play
are dull to read about; and the only other thing is meals, and to dwell
on what you eat is greedy and not like a hero at all. A hero is always
contented with a venison pasty and a horn of sack. All the same, the
meals were very interesting; with things you do not get at home--Lent
pies with custard and currants in them, sausage rolls and fiede cakes,
and raisin cakes and apple turnovers, and honeycomb and syllabubs,
besides as much new milk as you cared about, and cream now and then,
and cheese always on the table for tea. Father told Mrs Pettigrew to get
what meals she liked, and she got these strange but attractive foods.

In a story about Wouldbegoods it is not proper to tell of times when
only some of us were naughty, so I will pass lightly over the time when
Noel got up the kitchen chimney and brought three bricks and an old
starling’s nest and about a ton of soot down with him when he fell. They
never use the big chimney in the summer, but cook in the wash-house. Nor
do I wish to dwell on what H. O. did when he went into the dairy. I do
not know what his motive was. But Mrs Pettigrew said SHE knew; and she
locked him in, and said if it was cream he wanted he should have enough,
and she wouldn’t let him out till tea-time. The cat had also got into
the dairy for some reason of her own, and when H. O. was tired of
whatever he went in for he poured all the milk into the churn and tried
to teach the cat to swim in it. He must have been desperate. The cat did
not even try to learn, and H. O. had the scars on his hands for weeks.
I do not wish to tell tales of H. O., for he is very young, and whatever
he does he always catches it for; but I will just allude to our being
told not to eat the greengages in the garden. And we did not. And
whatever H. O. did was Noel’s fault--for Noel told H. O. that greengages
would grow again all right if you did not bite as far as the stone, just
as wounds are not mortal except when you are pierced through the heart.
So the two of them bit bites out of every greengage they could reach.
And of course the pieces did not grow again.

Oswald did not do things like these, but then he is older than his
brothers. The only thing he did just about then was making a booby-trap
for Mrs Pettigrew when she had locked H. O. up in the dairy, and
unfortunately it was the day she was going out in her best things, and
part of the trap was a can of water. Oswald was not willingly vicious;
it was but a light and thoughtless act which he had every reason to
be sorry for afterwards. And he is sorry even without those reasons,
because he knows it is ungentlemanly to play tricks on women.

I remember Mother telling Dora and me when we were little that you ought
to be very kind and polite to servants, because they have to work very
hard, and do not have so many good times as we do. I used to think about
Mother more at the Moat House than I did at Blackheath, especially in
the garden. She was very fond of flowers, and she used to tell us about
the big garden where she used to live; and I remember Dora and I helped
her to plant seeds. But it is no use wishing. She would have liked that
garden, though.

The girls and the white mice did not do anything boldly wicked--though
of course they used to borrow Mrs Pettigrew’s needles, which made her
very nasty. Needles that are borrowed might just as well be stolen. But
I say no more.

I have only told you these things to show the kind of events which
occurred on the days I don’t tell you about. On the whole, we had an
excellent time.

It was on the day we had the pillow-fight that we went for the long
walk. Not the Pilgrimage--that is another story. We did not mean to have
a pillow-fight. It is not usual to have them after breakfast, but Oswald
had come up to get his knife out of the pocket of his Etons, to cut some
wire we were making rabbit snares of. It is a very good knife, with a
file in it, as well as a corkscrew and other things--and he did not come
down at once, because he was detained by having to make an apple-pie bed
for Dicky. Dicky came up after him to see what he was up to, and when he
did see he buzzed a pillow at Oswald, and the fight began. The others,
hearing the noise of battle from afar, hastened to the field of action,
all except Dora, who couldn’t because of being laid up with her foot,
and Daisy, because she is a little afraid of us still, when we are
all together. She thinks we are rough. This comes of having only one
brother.

Well, the fight was a very fine one. Alice backed me up, and Noel and
H. O. backed Dicky, and Denny heaved a pillow or two; but he cannot shy
straight, so I don’t know which side he was on.

And just as the battle raged most fiercely, Mrs Pettigrew came in and
snatched the pillows away, and shook those of the warriors who were
small enough for it. SHE was rough if you like. She also used language I
should have thought she would be above. She said, Drat you!’ and
‘Drabbit you!’ The last is a thing I have never heard said before.
She said--

‘There’s no peace of your life with you children. Drat your antics! And
that poor, dear, patient gentleman right underneath, with his headache
and his handwriting: and you rampaging about over his head like young
bull-calves. I wonder you haven’t more sense, a great girl like you.’

She said this to Alice, and Alice answered gently, as we are told to
do--

‘I really am awfully sorry; we forgot about the headache. Don’t be
cross, Mrs Pettigrew; we didn’t mean to; we didn’t think.’

‘You never do,’ she said, and her voice, though grumpy, was no longer
violent. ‘Why on earth you can’t take yourselves off for the day I don’t
know.’

We all said, ‘But may we?’

She said, ‘Of course you may. Now put on your boots and go for a good
long walk. And I’ll tell you what--I’ll put you up a snack, and you can
have an egg to your tea to make up for missing your dinner. Now don’t go
clattering about the stairs and passages, there’s good children. See if
you can’t be quiet this once, and give the good gentleman a chance with
his copying.’

She went off. Her bark is worse than her bite. She does not understand
anything about writing books, though. She thinks Albert’s uncle copies
things out of printed books, when he is really writing new ones. I
wonder how she thinks printed books get made first of all. Many servants
are like this.

She gave us the ‘snack’ in a basket, and sixpence to buy milk with. She
said any of the farms would let us have it, only most likely it would be
skim. We thanked her politely, and she hurried us out of the front door
as if we’d been chickens on a pansy bed.

(I did not know till after I had left the farm gate open, and the hens
had got into the garden, that these feathered bipeds display a great
partiality for the young buds of plants of the genus viola, to which
they are extremely destructive. I was told that by the gardener. I
looked it up in the gardening book afterwards to be sure he was right.
You do learn a lot of things in the country.)

We went through the garden as far as the church, and then we rested
a bit in the porch, and just looked into the basket to see what the
‘snack’ was. It proved to be sausage rolls and queen cakes, and a Lent
pie in a round tin dish, and some hard-boiled eggs, and some apples. We
all ate the apples at once, so as not to have to carry them about with
us. The churchyard smells awfully good. It is the wild thyme that grows
on the graves. This is another thing we did not know before we came into
the country.

Then the door of the church tower was ajar, and we all went up; it had
always been locked before when we had tried it.

We saw the ringers’ loft where the ends of the bellropes hang down with
long, furry handles to them like great caterpillars, some red, and some
blue and white, but we did not pull them. And then we went up to where
the bells are, very big and dusty among large dirty beams; and four
windows with no glass, only shutters like Venetian blinds, but they
won’t pull up. There were heaps of straws and sticks on the window
ledges. We think they were owls’ nests, but we did not see any owls.

Then the tower stairs got very narrow and dark, and we went on up, and
we came to a door and opened it suddenly, and it was like being hit in
the face, the light was so sudden. And there we were on the top of
the tower, which is flat, and people have cut their names on it, and a
turret at one corner, and a low wall all round, up and down, like castle
battlements. And we looked down and saw the roof of the church, and the
leads, and the churchyard, and our garden, and the Moat House, and the
farm, and Mrs Simpkins’s cottage, looking very small, and other farms
looking like toy things out of boxes, and we saw corn-fields and meadows
and pastures. A pasture is not the same thing as a meadow, whatever you
may think. And we saw the tops of trees and hedges, looking like the map
of the United States, and villages, and a tower that did not look very
far away standing by itself on the top of a hill. Alice pointed to it,
and said--

‘What’s that?’

‘It’s not a church,’ said Noel, ‘because there’s no churchyard. Perhaps
it’s a tower of mystery that covers the entrance to a subterranean vault
with treasure in it.’

Dicky said, ‘Subterranean fiddlestick!’ and ‘A waterworks, more likely.’

Alice thought perhaps it was a ruined castle, and the rest of its
crumbling walls were concealed by ivy, the growth of years.

Oswald could not make his mind up what it was, so he said, ‘Let’s go and
see! We may as well go there as anywhere.’

So we got down out of the church tower and dusted ourselves, and set
out.

The Tower of Mystery showed quite plainly from the road, now that we
knew where to look for it, because it was on the top of a hill. We began
to walk. But the tower did not seem to get any nearer. And it was very
hot.

So we sat down in a meadow where there was a stream in the ditch and ate
the ‘snack’. We drank the pure water from the brook out of our hands,
because there was no farm to get milk at just there, and it was too much
fag to look for one--and, besides, we thought we might as well save the
sixpence.

Then we started again, and still the tower looked as far off as ever.
Denny began to drag his feet, though he had brought a walking-stick
which none of the rest of us had, and said--

‘I wish a cart would come along. We might get a lift.’

He knew all about getting lifts, of course, from having been in the
country before. He is not quite the white mouse we took him for at
first. Of course when you live in Lewisham or Blackheath you learn other
things. If you asked for a lift in Lewisham, High Street, your only
reply would be jeers. We sat down on a heap of stones, and decided that
we would ask for a lift from the next cart, whichever way it was going.
It was while we were waiting that Oswald found out about plantain seeds
being good to eat.

When the sound of wheels came we remarked with joy that the cart was
going towards the Tower of Mystery. It was a cart a man was going to
fetch a pig home in. Denny said--

‘I say, you might give us a lift. Will you?’

The man who was going for the pig said--

‘What, all that little lot?’ but he winked at Alice, and we saw that
he meant to aid us on our way. So we climbed up, and he whipped up the
horse and asked us where we were going. He was a kindly old man, with
a face like a walnut shell, and white hair and beard like a
jack-in-the-box.

‘We want to get to the tower,’ Alice said. ‘Is it a ruin, or not?’

‘It ain’t no ruin,’ the man said; ‘no fear of that! The man wot built it
he left so much a year to be spent on repairing of it! Money that might
have put bread in honest folks’ mouths.’

We asked was it a church then, or not.

‘Church?’ he said. ‘Not it. It’s more of a tombstone, from all I can
make out. They do say there was a curse on him that built it, and he
wasn’t to rest in earth or sea. So he’s buried half-way up the tower--if
you can call it buried.’

‘Can you go up it?’ Oswald asked.

‘Lord love you! yes; a fine view from the top they say. I’ve never
been up myself, though I’ve lived in sight of it, boy and man, these
sixty-three years come harvest.’

Alice asked whether you had to go past the dead and buried person to get
to the top of the tower, and could you see the coffin.

‘No, no,’ the man said; ‘that’s all hid away behind a slab of stone,
that is, with reading on it. You’ve no call to be afraid, missy. It’s
daylight all the way up. But I wouldn’t go there after dark, so I
wouldn’t. It’s always open, day and night, and they say tramps sleep
there now and again. Anyone who likes can sleep there, but it wouldn’t
be me.’

We thought that it would not be us either, but we wanted to go more than
ever, especially when the man said--

‘My own great-uncle of the mother’s side, he was one of the masons that
set up the stone slab. Before then it was thick glass, and you could
see the dead man lying inside, as he’d left it in his will. He was lying
there in a glass coffin with his best clothes--blue satin and silver, my
uncle said, such as was all the go in his day, with his wig on, and his
sword beside him, what he used to wear. My uncle said his hair had grown
out from under his wig, and his beard was down to the toes of him. My
uncle he always upheld that that dead man was no deader than you and me,
but was in a sort of fit, a transit, I think they call it, and looked
for him to waken into life again some day. But the doctor said not. It
was only something done to him like Pharaoh in the Bible afore he was
buried.’

Alice whispered to Oswald that we should be late for tea, and wouldn’t
it be better to go back now directly. But he said--

‘If you’re afraid, say so; and you needn’t come in anyway--but I’m going
on.’

The man who was going for the pig put us down at a gate quite near the
tower--at least it looked so until we began to walk again. We thanked
him, and he said--

‘Quite welcome,’ and drove off.

We were rather quiet going through the wood. What we had heard made us
very anxious to see the tower--all except Alice, who would keep talking
about tea, though not a greedy girl by nature. None of the others
encouraged her, but Oswald thought himself that we had better be home
before dark.

As we went up the path through the wood we saw a poor wayfarer with
dusty bare feet sitting on the bank.

He stopped us and said he was a sailor, and asked for a trifle to help
him to get back to his ship.

I did not like the look of him much myself, but Alice said, ‘Oh, the
poor man, do let’s help him, Oswald.’ So we held a hurried council, and
decided to give him the milk sixpence. Oswald had it in his purse, and
he had to empty the purse into his hand to find the sixpence, for that
was not all the money he had, by any means. Noel said afterwards that
he saw the wayfarer’s eyes fastened greedily upon the shining pieces as
Oswald returned them to his purse. Oswald has to own that he purposely
let the man see that he had more money, so that the man might not feel
shy about accepting so large a sum as sixpence.

The man blessed our kind hearts and we went on.

The sun was shining very brightly, and the Tower of Mystery did not look
at all like a tomb when we got to it. The bottom Storey was on arches,
all open, and ferns and things grew underneath. There was a round stone
stair going up in the middle. Alice began to gather ferns while we went
up, but when we had called out to her that it was as the pig-man had
said, and daylight all the way up, she said--

‘All right. I’m not afraid. I’m only afraid of being late home,’ and
came up after us. And perhaps, though not downright manly truthfulness,
this was as much as you could expect from a girl.

There were holes in the little tower of the staircase to let light in.
At the top of it was a thick door with iron bolts. We shot these back,
and it was not fear but caution that made Oswald push open the door so
very slowly and carefully.

Because, of course, a stray dog or cat might have got shut up there by
accident, and it would have startled Alice very much if it had jumped
out on us.

When the door was opened we saw that there was no such thing. It was a
room with eight sides. Denny says it is the shape called octogenarian;
because a man named Octagius invented it. There were eight large arched
windows with no glass, only stone-work, like in churches. The room was
full of sunshine, and you could see the blue sky through the windows,
but nothing else, because they were so high up. It was so bright we
began to think the pig-man had been kidding us. Under one of the windows
was a door. We went through, and there was a little passage and then a
turret-twisting stair, like in the church, but quite light with windows.
When we had gone some way up this, we came to a sort of landing, and
there was a block of stone let into the wall--polished--Denny said it
was Aberdeen graphite, with gold letters cut in it. It said--

     ‘Here lies the body of Mr Richard Ravenal
     Born 1720.  Died 1779.’

and a verse of poetry:

     ‘Here lie I, between earth and sky,
     Think upon me, dear passers-by,
     And you who do my tombstone see
     Be kind to say a prayer for me.’

‘How horrid!’ Alice said. ‘Do let’s get home.’

‘We may as well go to the top,’ Dicky said, ‘just to say we’ve been.’

And Alice is no funk--so she agreed; though I could see she did not like
it.

Up at the top it was like the top of the church tower, only octogenarian
in shape, instead of square.

Alice got all right there; because you cannot think much about ghosts
and nonsense when the sun is shining bang down on you at four o’clock in
the afternoon, and you can see red farm-roofs between the trees, and the
safe white roads, with people in carts like black ants crawling.

It was very jolly, but we felt we ought to be getting back, because tea
is at five, and we could not hope to find lifts both ways.

So we started to go down. Dicky went first, then Oswald, then Alice--and
H. O. had just stumbled over the top step and saved himself by Alice’s
back, which nearly upset Oswald and Dicky, when the hearts of all stood
still, and then went on by leaps and bounds, like the good work in
missionary magazines.

For, down below us, in the tower where the man whose beard grew down to
his toes after he was dead was buried, there was a noise--a loud noise.
And it was like a door being banged and bolts fastened. We tumbled over
each other to get back into the open sunshine on the top of the tower,
and Alice’s hand got jammed between the edge of the doorway and H. O.’s
boot; it was bruised black and blue, and another part bled, but she did
not notice it till long after.

We looked at each other, and Oswald said in a firm voice (at least, I
hope it was)--

‘What was that?’

‘He HAS waked up,’ Alice said. ‘Oh, I know he has. Of course there is a
door for him to get out by when he wakes. He’ll come up here. I know he
will.’

Dicky said, and his voice was not at all firm (I noticed that at the
time), ‘It doesn’t matter, if he’s ALIVE.’

‘Unless he’s come to life a raving lunatic,’ Noel said, and we all stood
with our eyes on the doorway of the turret--and held our breath to hear.

But there was no more noise.

Then Oswald said--and nobody ever put it in the Golden Deed book, though
they own that it was brave and noble of him--he said--

‘Perhaps it was only the wind blowing one of the doors to. I’ll go down
and see, if you will, Dick.’

Dicky only said--

‘The wind doesn’t shoot bolts.’

‘A bolt from the blue,’ said Denny to himself, looking up at the sky.
His father is a sub-editor. He had gone very red, and he was holding on
to Alice’s hand. Suddenly he stood up quite straight and said--

‘I’m not afraid. I’ll go and see.’

THIS was afterwards put in the Golden Deed book. It ended in Oswald
and Dicky and Denny going. Denny went first because he said he would
rather--and Oswald understood this and let him. If Oswald had pushed
first it would have been like Sir Lancelot refusing to let a young
knight win his spurs. Oswald took good care to go second himself,
though. The others never understood this. You don’t expect it from
girls; but I did think father would have understood without Oswald
telling him, which of course he never could.

We all went slowly.

At the bottom of the turret stairs we stopped short. Because the door
there was bolted fast and would not yield to shoves, however desperate
and united.

Only now somehow we felt that Mr Richard Ravenal was all right and
quiet, but that some one had done it for a lark, or perhaps not known
about anyone being up there. So we rushed up, and Oswald told the others
in a few hasty but well-chosen words, and we all leaned over between the
battlements, and shouted, ‘Hi! you there!’

Then from under the arches of the quite-downstairs part of the tower a
figure came forth--and it was the sailor who had had our milk sixpence.
He looked up and he spoke to us. He did not speak loud, but he spoke
loud enough for us to hear every word quite plainly. He said--

‘Drop that.’

Oswald said, ‘Drop what?’

He said, ‘That row.’

Oswald said, ‘Why?’

He said, ‘Because if you don’t I’ll come up and make you, and pretty
quick too, so I tell you.’

Dicky said, ‘Did you bolt the door?’

The man said, ‘I did so, my young cock.’

Alice said--and Oswald wished to goodness she had held her tongue,
because he saw right enough the man was not friendly--‘Oh, do come and
let us out--do, please.’

While she was saying it Oswald suddenly saw that he did not want the
man to come up. So he scurried down the stairs because he thought he had
seen something on the door on the top side, and sure enough there were
two bolts, and he shot them into their sockets. This bold act was not
put in the Golden Deed book, because when Alice wanted to, the others
said it was not GOOD of Oswald to think of this, but only CLEVER. I
think sometimes, in moments of danger and disaster, it is as good to
be clever as it is to be good. But Oswald would never demean himself to
argue about this.

When he got back the man was still standing staring up. Alice said--

‘Oh, Oswald, he says he won’t let us out unless we give him all our
money. And we might be here for days and days and all night as well. No
one knows where we are to come and look for us. Oh, do let’s give it him
ALL.’

She thought the lion of the English nation, which does not know when
it is beaten, would be ramping in her brother’s breast. But Oswald kept
calm. He said--

‘All right,’ and he made the others turn out their pockets. Denny had a
bad shilling, with a head on both sides, and three halfpence. H. O. had
a halfpenny. Noel had a French penny, which is only good for chocolate
machines at railway stations. Dicky had tenpence-halfpenny, and Oswald
had a two-shilling piece of his own that he was saving up to buy a gun
with. Oswald tied the whole lot up in his handkerchief, and looking over
the battlements, he said--

‘You are an ungrateful beast. We gave you sixpence freely of our own
will.’

The man did look a little bit ashamed, but he mumbled something about
having his living to get. Then Oswald said--

‘Here you are. Catch!’ and he flung down the handkerchief with the money
in it.

The man muffed the catch--butter-fingered idiot!--but he picked up
the handkerchief and undid it, and when he saw what was in it he swore
dreadfully. The cad!

‘Look here,’ he called out, ‘this won’t do, young shaver. I want those
there shiners I see in your pus! Chuck ‘em along!’

Then Oswald laughed. He said--

‘I shall know you again anywhere, and you’ll be put in prison for this.
Here are the SHINERS.’ And he was so angry he chucked down purse and
all. The shiners were not real ones, but only card-counters that looked
like sovereigns on one side. Oswald used to carry them in his purse so
as to look affluent. He does not do this now.

When the man had seen what was in the purse he disappeared under the
tower, and Oswald was glad of what he had done about the bolts--and he
hoped they were as strong as the ones on the other side of the door.

They were.

We heard the man kicking and pounding at the door, and I am not ashamed
to say that we were all holding on to each other very tight. I am proud,
however, to relate that nobody screamed or cried.

After what appeared to be long years, the banging stopped, and presently
we saw the brute going away among the trees. Then Alice did cry, and I
do not blame her. Then Oswald said--

‘It’s no use. Even if he’s undone the door, he may be in ambush. We must
hold on here till somebody comes.’

Then Alice said, speaking chokily because she had not quite done
crying--

‘Let’s wave a flag.’

By the most fortunate accident she had on one of her Sunday petticoats,
though it was Monday. This petticoat is white. She tore it out at the
gathers, and we tied it to Denny’s stick, and took turns to wave it. We
had laughed at his carrying a stick before, but we were very sorry now
that we had done so.

And the tin dish the Lent pie was baked in we polished with our
handkerchiefs, and moved it about in the sun so that the sun might
strike on it and signal our distress to some of the outlying farms.

This was perhaps the most dreadful adventure that had then ever happened
to us. Even Alice had now stopped thinking of Mr Richard Ravenal, and
thought only of the lurker in ambush.

We all felt our desperate situation keenly. I must say Denny behaved
like anything but a white mouse. When it was the others’ turn to wave,
he sat on the leads of the tower and held Alice’s and Noel’s hands, and
said poetry to them--yards and yards of it. By some strange fatality it
seemed to comfort them. It wouldn’t have me.

He said ‘The Battle of the Baltic’, and ‘Gray’s Elegy’, right through,
though I think he got wrong in places, and the ‘Revenge’, and Macaulay’s
thing about Lars Porsena and the Nine Gods. And when it was his turn he
waved like a man.

I will try not to call him a white mouse any more. He was a brick that
day, and no mouse.

The sun was low in the heavens, and we were sick of waving and very
hungry, when we saw a cart in the road below. We waved like mad, and
shouted, and Denny screamed exactly like a railway whistle, a thing none
of us had known before that he could do.

And the cart stopped. And presently we saw a figure with a white beard
among the trees. It was our Pig-man.

We bellowed the awful truth to him, and when he had taken it in--he
thought at first we were kidding--he came up and let us out.

He had got the pig; luckily it was a very small one--and we were not
particular. Denny and Alice sat on the front of the cart with the
Pig-man, and the rest of us got in with the pig, and the man drove us
right home. You may think we talked it over on the way. Not us. We went
to sleep, among the pig, and before long the Pig-man stopped and got us
to make room for Alice and Denny. There was a net over the cart. I never
was so sleepy in my life, though it was not more than bedtime.


Generally, after anything exciting, you are punished--but this could not
be, because we had only gone for a walk, exactly as we were told.

There was a new rule made, though. No walks except on the high-roads,
and we were always to take Pincher and either Lady, the deer-hound, or
Martha, the bulldog. We generally hate rules, but we did not mind this
one.

Father gave Denny a gold pencil-case because he was first to go down
into the tower. Oswald does not grudge Denny this, though some might
think he deserved at least a silver one. But Oswald is above such paltry
jealousies.



CHAPTER 5. THE WATERWORKS

This is the story of one of the most far-reaching and influentially
naughty things we ever did in our lives. We did not mean to do such
a deed. And yet we did do it. These things will happen with the
best-regulated consciences.

The story of this rash and fatal act is intimately involved--which means
all mixed up anyhow--with a private affair of Oswald’s, and the one
cannot be revealed without the other. Oswald does not particularly want
his story to be remembered, but he wishes to tell the truth, and perhaps
it is what father calls a wholesome discipline to lay bare the awful
facts.

It was like this.

On Alice’s and Noel’s birthday we went on the river for a picnic. Before
that we had not known that there was a river so near us. Afterwards
father said he wished we had been allowed to remain on our pristine
ignorance, whatever that is. And perhaps the dark hour did dawn when we
wished so too. But a truce to vain regrets.

It was rather a fine thing in birthdays. The uncle sent a box of toys
and sweets, things that were like a vision from another and a brighter
world. Besides that Alice had a knife, a pair of shut-up scissors, a
silk handkerchief, a book--it was The Golden Age and is A1 except where
it gets mixed with grown-up nonsense. Also a work-case lined with pink
plush, a boot-bag, which no one in their senses would use because it
had flowers in wool all over it. And she had a box of chocolates and a
musical box that played ‘The Man who broke’ and two other tunes, and two
pairs of kid gloves for church, and a box of writing-paper--pink--with
‘Alice’ on it in gold writing, and an egg coloured red that said ‘A.
Bastable’ in ink on one side. These gifts were the offerings of Oswald,
Dora, Dicky, Albert’s uncle, Daisy, Mr Foulkes (our own robber), Noel,
H. O., father and Denny. Mrs Pettigrew gave the egg. It was a kindly
housekeeper’s friendly token.

I shall not tell you about the picnic on the river because the happiest
times form but dull reading when they are written down. I will merely
state that it was prime. Though happy, the day was uneventful. The only
thing exciting enough to write about was in one of the locks, where
there was a snake--a viper. It was asleep in a warm sunny corner of the
lock gate, and when the gate was shut it fell off into the water.

Alice and Dora screamed hideously. So did Daisy, but her screams were
thinner.

The snake swam round and round all the time our boat was in the lock.
It swam with four inches of itself--the head end--reared up out of the
water, exactly like Kaa in the Jungle Book--so we know Kipling is a true
author and no rotter. We were careful to keep our hands well inside the
boat. A snake’s eyes strike terror into the boldest breast.

When the lock was full father killed the viper with a boat-hook. I was
sorry for it myself. It was indeed a venomous serpent. But it was the
first we had ever seen, except at the Zoo. And it did swim most awfully
well.

Directly the snake had been killed H. O. reached out for its corpse,
and the next moment the body of our little brother was seen wriggling
conclusively on the boat’s edge. This exciting spectacle was not of
a lasting nature. He went right in. Father clawed him out. He is very
unlucky with water.

Being a birthday, but little was said. H. O. was wrapped in everybody’s
coats, and did not take any cold at all.

This glorious birthday ended with an iced cake and ginger wine, and
drinking healths. Then we played whatever we liked. There had been
rounders during the afternoon. It was a day to be for ever marked by
memory’s brightest what’s-its-name.

I should not have said anything about the picnic but for one thing. It
was the thin edge of the wedge. It was the all-powerful lever that moved
but too many events. You see, WE WERE NO LONGER STRANGERS TO THE RIVER.

And we went there whenever we could. Only we had to take the dogs, and
to promise no bathing without grown-ups. But paddling in back waters was
allowed. I say no more.

I have not numerated Noel’s birthday presents because I wish to leave
something to the imagination of my young readers. (The best authors
always do this.) If you will take the large, red catalogue of the Army
and Navy Stores, and just make a list of about fifteen of the things you
would like best--prices from 2s. to 25s.--you will get a very good idea
of Noel’s presents, and it will help you to make up your mind in case
you are asked just before your next birthday what you really NEED.

One of Noel’s birthday presents was a cricket ball. He cannot bowl for
nuts, and it was a first-rate ball. So some days after the birthday
Oswald offered him to exchange it for a coconut he had won at the fair,
and two pencils (new), and a brand-new note-book. Oswald thought, and
he still thinks, that this was a fair exchange, and so did Noel at the
time, and he agreed to it, and was quite pleased till the girls said it
wasn’t fair, and Oswald had the best of it. And then that young beggar
Noel wanted the ball back, but Oswald, though not angry, was firm.

‘You said it was a bargain, and you shook hands on it,’ he said, and he
said it quite kindly and calmly.

Noel said he didn’t care. He wanted his cricket ball back. And the girls
said it was a horrid shame.

If they had not said that, Oswald might yet have consented to let Noel
have the beastly ball, but now, of course, he was not going to. He
said--

‘Oh, yes, I daresay. And then you would be wanting the coconut and
things again the next minute.’

‘No, I shouldn’t,’ Noel said. It turned out afterwards he and H. O.
had eaten the coconut, which only made it worse. And it made them worse
too--which is what the book calls poetic justice.

Dora said, ‘I don’t think it was fair,’ and even Alice said--

‘Do let him have it back, Oswald.’

I wish to be just to Alice. She did not know then about the coconut
having been secretly wolfed up.

We were in the garden. Oswald felt all the feelings of the hero when
the opposing forces gathered about him are opposing as hard as ever they
can. He knew he was not unfair, and he did not like to be jawed at just
because Noel had eaten the coconut and wanted the ball back. Though
Oswald did not know then about the eating of the coconut, but he felt
the injustice in his soul all the same.

Noel said afterwards he meant to offer Oswald something else to make up
for the coconut, but he said nothing about this at the time.

‘Give it me, I say,’ Noel said.

And Oswald said, ‘Shan’t!’

Then Noel called Oswald names, and Oswald did not answer back but
just kept smiling pleasantly, and carelessly throwing up the ball and
catching it again with an air of studied indifference.

It was Martha’s fault that what happened happened. She is the bull-dog,
and very stout and heavy. She had just been let loose and she came
bounding along in her clumsy way, and jumped up on Oswald, who is
beloved by all dumb animals. (You know how sagacious they are.) Well,
Martha knocked the ball out of Oswald’s hands, and it fell on the grass,
and Noel pounced on it like a hooded falcon on its prey. Oswald would
scorn to deny that he was not going to stand this, and the next moment
the two were rolling over on the grass, and very soon Noel was made to
bite the dust. And serve him right. He is old enough to know his own
mind.

Then Oswald walked slowly away with the ball, and the others picked Noel
up, and consoled the beaten, but Dicky would not take either side.

And Oswald went up into his own room and lay on his bed, and reflected
gloomy reflections about unfairness.

Presently he thought he would like to see what the others were doing
without their knowing he cared. So he went into the linen-room and
looked out of its window, and he saw they were playing Kings and
Queens--and Noel had the biggest paper crown and the longest stick
sceptre.

Oswald turned away without a word, for it really was sickening.

Then suddenly his weary eyes fell upon something they had not before
beheld. It was a square trap-door in the ceiling of the linen-room.

Oswald never hesitated. He crammed the cricket ball into his pocket and
climbed up the shelves and unbolted the trap-door, and shoved it up,
and pulled himself up through it. Though above all was dark and smelt
of spiders, Oswald fearlessly shut the trap-door down again before he
struck a match. He always carries matches. He is a boy fertile in every
subtle expedient. Then he saw he was in the wonderful, mysterious place
between the ceiling and the roof of the house. The roof is beams
and tiles. Slits of light show through the tiles here and there. The
ceiling, on its other and top side, is made of rough plaster and beams.
If you walk on the beams it is all right--if you walk on the plaster you
go through with your feet. Oswald found this out later, but some fine
instinct now taught the young explorer where he ought to tread and where
not. It was splendid. He was still very angry with the others and he was
glad he had found out a secret they jolly well didn’t know.

He walked along a dark, narrow passage. Every now and then cross-beams
barred his way, and he had to creep under them. At last a small door
loomed before him with cracks of light under and over. He drew back the
rusty bolts and opened it. It opened straight on to the leads, a flat
place between two steep red roofs, with a parapet two feet high back and
front, so that no one could see you. It was a place no one could have
invented better than, if they had tried, for hiding in.

Oswald spent the whole afternoon there. He happened to have a volume of
Percy’s Anecdotes in his pocket, the one about lawyers, as well as a
few apples. While he read he fingered the cricket ball, and presently it
rolled away, and he thought he would get it by-and-by.

When the tea-bell rang he forgot the ball and went hurriedly down, for
apples do not keep the inside from the pangs of hunger.

Noel met him on the landing, got red in the face, and said--

‘It wasn’t QUITE fair about the ball, because H. O. and I had eaten the
coconut. YOU can have it.’

‘I don’t want your beastly ball,’ Oswald said, ‘only I hate unfairness.
However, I don’t know where it is just now. When I find it you shall
have it to bowl with as often as you want.’

‘Then you’re not waxy?’

And Oswald said ‘No’ and they went in to tea together. So that was all
right. There were raisin cakes for tea.

Next day we happened to want to go down to the river quite early. I
don’t know why; this is called Fate, or Destiny. We dropped in at the
‘Rose and Crown’ for some ginger-beer on our way. The landlady is a
friend of ours and lets us drink it in her back parlour, instead of in
the bar, which would be improper for girls.

We found her awfully busy, making pies and jellies, and her two sisters
were hurrying about with great hams, and pairs of chickens, and rounds
of cold beef and lettuces, and pickled salmon and trays of crockery and
glasses.

‘It’s for the angling competition,’ she said.

We said, ‘What’s that?’

‘Why,’ she said, slicing cucumber like beautiful machinery while she
said it, ‘a lot of anglers come down some particular day and fish one
particular bit of the river. And the one that catches most fish gets the
prize. They’re fishing the pen above Stoneham Lock. And they all come
here to dinner. So I’ve got my hands full and a trifle over.’

We said, ‘Couldn’t we help?’

But she said, ‘Oh, no, thank you. Indeed not, please. I really am so I
don’t know which way to turn. Do run along, like dears.’

So we ran along like these timid but graceful animals.

Need I tell the intellectual reader that we went straight off to the pen
above Stoneham Lock to see the anglers competing? Angling is the same
thing as fishing.

I am not going to try and explain locks to you. If you’ve never seen
a lock you could never understand even if I wrote it in words of one
syllable and pages and pages long. And if you have, you’ll understand
without my telling you. It is harder than Euclid if you don’t know
beforehand. But you might get a grown-up person to explain it to you
with books or wooden bricks.

I will tell you what a pen is because that is easy. It is the bit of
river between one lock and the next. In some rivers ‘pens’ are called
‘reaches’, but pen is the proper word.

We went along the towing-path; it is shady with willows, aspens,
alders, elders, oaks and other trees. On the banks are flowers--yarrow,
meadow-sweet, willow herb, loosestrife, and lady’s bed-straw. Oswald
learned the names of all these trees and plants on the day of the
picnic. The others didn’t remember them, but Oswald did. He is a boy of
what they call relenting memory.

The anglers were sitting here and there on the shady bank among the
grass and the different flowers I have named. Some had dogs with them,
and some umbrellas, and some had only their wives and families.

We should have liked to talk to them and ask how they liked their lot,
and what kinds of fish there were, and whether they were nice to eat,
but we did not like to.

Denny had seen anglers before and he knew they liked to be talked to,
but though he spoke to them quite like to equals he did not ask the
things we wanted to know. He just asked whether they’d had any luck, and
what bait they used.

And they answered him back politely. I am glad I am not an angler.

It is an immovable amusement, and, as often as not, no fish to speak of
after all.

Daisy and Dora had stayed at home: Dora’s foot was nearly well but they
seem really to like sitting still. I think Dora likes to have a little
girl to order about. Alice never would stand it. When we got to Stoneham
Lock Denny said he should go home and fetch his fishing-rod. H. O. went
with him. This left four of us--Oswald, Alice, Dicky, and Noel. We went
on down the towing-path. The lock shuts up (that sounds as if it was
like the lock on a door, but it is very otherwise) between one pen of
the river and the next; the pen where the anglers were was full right
up over the roots of the grass and flowers. But the pen below was nearly
empty.

‘You can see the poor river’s bones,’ Noel said.

And so you could.

Stones and mud and dried branches, and here and there an old kettle or a
tin pail with no bottom to it, that some bargee had chucked in.

From walking so much along the river we knew many of the bargees.
Bargees are the captains and crews of the big barges that are pulled up
and down the river by slow horses. The horses do not swim. They walk
on the towing-path, with a rope tied to them, and the other end to the
barge. So it gets pulled along. The bargees we knew were a good friendly
sort, and used to let us go all over the barges when they were in a good
temper. They were not at all the sort of bullying, cowardly fiends
in human form that the young hero at Oxford fights a crowd of,
single-handed, in books.

The river does not smell nice when its bones are showing. But we went
along down, because Oswald wanted to get some cobbler’s wax in Falding
village for a bird-net he was making.

But just above Falding Lock, where the river is narrow and straight, we
saw a sad and gloomy sight--a big barge sitting flat on the mud because
there was not water enough to float her.

There was no one on board, but we knew by a red flannel waistcoat that
was spread out to dry on top that the barge belonged to friends of ours.

Then Alice said, ‘They have gone to find the man who turns on the water
to fill the pen. I daresay they won’t find him. He’s gone to his dinner,
I shouldn’t wonder. What a lovely surprise it would be if they came back
to find their barge floating high and dry on a lot of water! DO let’s
do it. It’s a long time since any of us did a kind action deserving of
being put in the Book of Golden Deeds.’

We had given that name to the minute-book of that beastly ‘Society of
the Wouldbegoods’. Then you could think of the book if you wanted to
without remembering the Society. I always tried to forget both of them.

Oswald said, ‘But how? YOU don’t know how. And if you did we haven’t got
a crowbar.’

I cannot help telling you that locks are opened with crowbars. You push
and push till a thing goes up and the water runs through. It is rather
like the little sliding door in the big door of a hen-house.

‘I know where the crowbar is,’ Alice said. ‘Dicky and I were down here
yesterday when you were su--’ She was going to say sulking, I know, but
she remembered manners ere too late so Oswald bears her no malice. She
went on: ‘Yesterday, when you were upstairs. And we saw the water-tender
open the lock and the weir sluices. It’s quite easy, isn’t it, Dicky?’

‘As easy as kiss your hand,’ said Dicky; ‘and what’s more, I know where
he keeps the other thing he opens the sluices with. I votes we do.’

‘Do let’s, if we can,’ Noel said, ‘and the bargees will bless the names
of their unknown benefactors. They might make a song about us, and sing
it on winter nights as they pass round the wassail bowl in front of the
cabin fire.’

Noel wanted to very much; but I don’t think it was altogether for
generousness, but because he wanted to see how the sluices opened. Yet
perhaps I do but wrong the boy.

We sat and looked at the barge a bit longer, and then Oswald said, well,
he didn’t mind going back to the lock and having a look at the crowbars.
You see Oswald did not propose this; he did not even care very much
about it when Alice suggested it.

But when we got to Stoneham Lock, and Dicky dragged the two heavy
crowbars from among the elder bushes behind a fallen tree, and began to
pound away at the sluice of the lock, Oswald felt it would not be manly
to stand idly apart. So he took his turn.

It was very hard work but we opened the lock sluices, and we did not
drop the crowbar into the lock either, as I have heard of being done by
older and sillier people.

The water poured through the sluices all green and solid, as if it had
been cut with a knife, and where it fell on the water underneath the
white foam spread like a moving counterpane. When we had finished the
lock we did the weir--which is wheels and chains--and the water pours
through over the stones in a magnificent waterfall and sweeps out all
round the weir-pool.

The sight of the foaming waterfalls was quite enough reward for our
heavy labours, even without the thought of the unspeakable gratitude
that the bargees would feel to us when they got back to their barge and
found her no longer a stick-in-the-mud, but bounding on the free bosom
of the river.

When we had opened all the sluices we gazed awhile on the beauties of
Nature, and then went home, because we thought it would be more truly
noble and good not to wait to be thanked for our kind and devoted
action--and besides, it was nearly dinner-time and Oswald thought it was
going to rain.

On the way home we agreed not to tell the others, because it would be
like boasting of our good acts.

‘They will know all about it,’ Noel said, ‘when they hear us being
blessed by the grateful bargees, and the tale of the Unknown Helpers is
being told by every village fireside. And then they can write it in the
Golden Deed book.’

So we went home. Denny and H. O. had thought better of it, and they were
fishing in the moat. They did not catch anything.

Oswald is very weather-wise--at least, so I have heard it said, and he
had thought there would be rain. There was. It came on while we were
at dinner--a great, strong, thundering rain, coming down in sheets--the
first rain we had had since we came to the Moat House.

We went to bed as usual. No presentiment of the coming awfulness clouded
our young mirth. I remember Dicky and Oswald had a wrestling match, and
Oswald won.

In the middle of the night Oswald was awakened by a hand on his face.
It was a wet hand and very cold. Oswald hit out, of course, but a voice
said, in a hoarse, hollow whisper--

‘Don’t be a young ass! Have you got any matches? My bed’s full of water;
it’s pouring down from the ceiling.’

Oswald’s first thoughts was that perhaps by opening those sluices we
had flooded some secret passage which communicated with the top of Moat
House, but when he was properly awake he saw that this could not be, on
account of the river being so low.

He had matches. He is, as I said before, a boy full of resources. He
struck one and lit a candle, and Dicky, for it was indeed he, gazed with
Oswald at the amazing spectacle.

Our bedroom floor was all wet in patches. Dicky’s bed stood in a pond,
and from the ceiling water was dripping in rich profusion at a dozen
different places. There was a great wet patch in the ceiling, and that
was blue, instead of white like the dry part, and the water dripped from
different parts of it.

In a moment Oswald was quite unmanned.

‘Krikey!’ he said, in a heart-broken tone, and remained an instant
plunged in thought.

‘What on earth are we to do?’ Dicky said.

And really for a short time even Oswald did not know. It was a
blood-curdling event, a regular facer. Albert’s uncle had gone to London
that day to stay till the next. Yet something must be done.

The first thing was to rouse the unconscious others from their deep
sleep, because the water was beginning to drip on to their beds, and
though as yet they knew it not, there was quite a pool on Noel’s bed,
just in the hollow behind where his knees were doubled up, and one of
H. O.’s boots was full of water, that surged wildly out when Oswald
happened to kick it over.

We woke them--a difficult task, but we did not shrink from it.


Then we said, ‘Get up, there is a flood! Wake up, or you will be drowned
in your beds! And it’s half past two by Oswald’s watch.’

They awoke slowly and very stupidly. H. O. was the slowest and
stupidest.


The water poured faster and faster from the ceiling.

We looked at each other and turned pale, and Noel said--

‘Hadn’t we better call Mrs Pettigrew?’

But Oswald simply couldn’t consent to this. He could not get rid of the
feeling that this was our fault somehow for meddling with the river,
though of course the clear star of reason told him it could not possibly
be the case.

We all devoted ourselves, heart and soul, to the work before us. We
put the bath under the worst and wettest place, and the jugs and basins
under lesser streams, and we moved the beds away to the dry end of the
room. Ours is a long attic that runs right across the house.

But the water kept coming in worse and worse. Our nightshirts were
wet through, so we got into our other shirts and knickerbockers, but
preserved bareness in our feet. And the floor kept on being half an inch
deep in water, however much we mopped it up.

We emptied the basins out of the window as fast as they filled, and we
baled the bath with a jug without pausing to complain how hard the
work was. All the same, it was more exciting than you can think. But in
Oswald’s dauntless breast he began to see that they would HAVE to call
Mrs Pettigrew.

A new waterfall broke out between the fire-grate and the mantelpiece,
and spread in devastating floods. Oswald is full of ingenious devices.
I think I have said this before, but it is quite true; and perhaps even
truer this time than it was last time I said it.

He got a board out of the box-room next door, and rested one end in the
chink between the fireplace and the mantelpiece, and laid the other end
on the back of a chair, then we stuffed the rest of the chink with our
nightgowns, and laid a towel along the plank, and behold, a noble stream
poured over the end of the board right into the bath we put there ready.
It was like Niagara, only not so round in shape. The first lot of water
that came down the chimney was very dirty. The wind whistled outside.
Noel said, ‘If it’s pipes burst, and not the rain, it will be nice for
the water-rates.’ Perhaps it was only natural after this for Denny to
begin with his everlasting poetry. He stopped mopping up the water to
say:

     ‘By this the storm grew loud apace,
     The water-rats were shrieking,
     And in the howl of Heaven each face
     Grew black as they were speaking.’

Our faces were black, and our hands too, but we did not take any notice;
we only told him not to gas but to go on mopping. And he did. And we all
did.

But more and more water came pouring down. You would not believe so much
could come off one roof.

When at last it was agreed that Mrs Pettigrew must be awakened at all
hazards, we went and woke Alice to do the fatal errand.

When she came back, with Mrs Pettigrew in a nightcap and red flannel
petticoat, we held our breath.

But Mrs Pettigrew did not even say, ‘What on earth have you children
been up to NOW?’ as Oswald had feared.

She simply sat down on my bed and said--

‘Oh, dear! oh, dear! oh, dear!’ ever so many times.

Then Denny said, ‘I once saw holes in a cottage roof. The man told me
it was done when the water came through the thatch. He said if the water
lies all about on the top of the ceiling, it breaks it down, but if you
make holes the water will only come through the holes and you can put
pails under the holes to catch it.’

So we made nine holes in the ceiling with the poker, and put pails,
baths and tubs under, and now there was not so much water on the floor.
But we had to keep on working like niggers, and Mrs Pettigrew and Alice
worked the same.

About five in the morning the rain stopped; about seven the water did
not come in so fast, and presently it only dripped slowly. Our task was
done.

This is the only time I was ever up all night. I wish it happened
oftener. We did not go back to bed then, but dressed and went down. We
all went to sleep in the afternoon, though. Quite without meaning to.

Oswald went up on the roof, before breakfast, to see if he could find
the hole where the rain had come in. He did not find any hole, but
he found the cricket ball jammed in the top of a gutter pipe which he
afterwards knew ran down inside the wall of the house and ran into the
moat below. It seems a silly dodge, but so it was.

When the men went up after breakfast to see what had caused the flood
they said there must have been a good half-foot of water on the leads
the night before for it to have risen high enough to go above the edge
of the lead, and of course when it got above the lead there was nothing
to stop it running down under it, and soaking through the ceiling. The
parapet and the roofs kept it from tumbling off down the sides of
the house in the natural way. They said there must have been some
obstruction in the pipe which ran down into the house, but whatever it
was the water had washed it away, for they put wires down, and the pipe
was quite clear.

While we were being told this Oswald’s trembling fingers felt at the wet
cricket ball in his pocket. And he KNEW, but he COULD not tell. He heard
them wondering what the obstruction could have been, and all the time he
had the obstruction in his pocket, and never said a single word.

I do not seek to defend him. But it really was an awful thing to have
been the cause of; and Mrs Pettigrew is but harsh and hasty. But this,
as Oswald knows too well, is no excuse for his silent conduct.

That night at tea Albert’s uncle was rather silent too. At last he
looked upon us with a glance full of intelligence, and said--

‘There was a queer thing happened yesterday. You know there was an
angling competition. The pen was kept full on purpose. Some mischievous
busybody went and opened the sluices and let all the water out. The
anglers’ holiday was spoiled. No, the rain wouldn’t have spoiled it
anyhow, Alice; anglers LIKE rain. The ‘Rose and Crown’ dinner was half
of it wasted because the anglers were so furious that a lot of them took
the next train to town. And this is the worst of all--a barge, that was
on the mud in the pen below, was lifted and jammed across the river and
the water tilted her over, and her cargo is on the river bottom. It was
coals.’

During this speech there were four of us who knew not where to turn our
agitated glances. Some of us tried bread-and-butter, but it seemed dry
and difficult, and those who tried tea choked and spluttered and were
sorry they had not let it alone. When the speech stopped Alice said, ‘It
was us.’

And with deepest feelings she and the rest of us told all about it.

Oswald did not say much. He was turning the obstruction round and round
in his pocket, and wishing with all his sentiments that he had owned
up like a man when Albert’s uncle asked him before tea to tell him all
about what had happened during the night.

When they had told all, Albert’s uncle told us four still more plainly,
and exactly, what we had done, and how much pleasure we had spoiled, and
how much of my father’s money we had wasted--because he would have to
pay for the coals being got up from the bottom of the river, if they
could be, and if not, for the price of the coals. And we saw it ALL.

And when he had done Alice burst out crying over her plate and said--

‘It’s no use! We HAVE tried to be good since we’ve been down here.

You don’t know how we’ve tried! And it’s all no use. I believe we are
the wickedest children in the whole world, and I wish we were all dead!’

This was a dreadful thing to say, and of course the rest of us were all
very shocked. But Oswald could not help looking at Albert’s uncle to see
how he would take it.

He said very gravely, ‘My dear kiddie, you ought to be sorry, and I wish
you to be sorry for what you’ve done. And you will be punished for it.’
(We were; our pocket-money was stopped and we were forbidden to go near
the river, besides impositions miles long.) ‘But,’ he went on, ‘you
mustn’t give up trying to be good. You are extremely naughty and
tiresome, as you know very well.’

Alice, Dicky, and Noel began to cry at about this time.

‘But you are not the wickedest children in the world by any means.’

Then he stood up and straightened his collar, and put his hands in his
pockets.

‘You’re very unhappy now,’ he said, ‘and you deserve to be. But I will
say one thing to you.’

Then he said a thing which Oswald at least will never forget (though but
little he deserved it, with the obstruction in his pocket, unowned up to
all the time).

He said, ‘I have known you all for four years--and you know as well as
I do how many scrapes I’ve seen you in and out of--but I’ve never known
one of you tell a lie, and I’ve never known one of you do a mean or
dishonourable action. And when you have done wrong you are always sorry.
Now this is something to stand firm on. You’ll learn to be good in the
other ways some day.’

He took his hands out of his pockets, and his face looked different, so
that three of the four guilty creatures knew he was no longer adamant,
and they threw themselves into his arms. Dora, Denny, Daisy, and H. O.,
of course, were not in it, and I think they thanked their stars.

Oswald did not embrace Albert’s uncle. He stood there and made up his
mind he would go for a soldier. He gave the wet ball one last squeeze,
and took his hand out of his pocket, and said a few words before going
to enlist. He said--

‘The others may deserve what you say. I hope they do, I’m sure. But I
don’t, because it was my rotten cricket ball that stopped up the pipe
and caused the midnight flood in our bedroom. And I knew it quite early
this morning. And I didn’t own up.’

Oswald stood there covered with shame, and he could feel the hateful
cricket ball heavy and cold against the top of his leg, through the
pocket.

Albert’s uncle said--and his voice made Oswald hot all over, but not
with shame--he said--

I shall not tell you what he said. It is no one’s business but Oswald’s;
only I will own it made Oswald not quite so anxious to run away for a
soldier as he had been before.

That owning up was the hardest thing I ever did. They did put that in
the Book of Golden Deeds, though it was not a kind or generous act, and
did no good to anyone or anything except Oswald’s own inside feelings.
I must say I think they might have let it alone. Oswald would rather
forget it. Especially as Dicky wrote it in and put this:

‘Oswald acted a lie, which, he knows, is as bad as telling one. But he
owned up when he needn’t have, and this condones his sin. We think he
was a thorough brick to do it.’

Alice scratched this out afterwards and wrote the record of the incident
in more flattering terms. But Dicky had used Father’s ink, and she used
Mrs Pettigrew’s, so anyone can read his underneath the scratching outs.

The others were awfully friendly to Oswald, to show they agreed with
Albert’s uncle in thinking I deserved as much share as anyone in any
praise there might be going.

It was Dora who said it all came from my quarrelling with Noel about
that rotten cricket ball; but Alice, gently yet firmly, made her shut
up.

I let Noel have the ball. It had been thoroughly soaked, but it dried
all right. But it could never be the same to me after what it had done
and what I had done.

I hope you will try to agree with Albert’s uncle and not think foul
scorn of Oswald because of this story. Perhaps you have done things
nearly as bad yourself sometimes. If you have, you will know how ‘owning
up’ soothes the savage breast and alleviates the gnawings of remorse.

If you have never done naughty acts I expect it is only because you
never had the sense to think of anything.



CHAPTER 6. THE CIRCUS

The ones of us who had started the Society of the Wouldbegoods began, at
about this time, to bother.

They said we had not done anything really noble--not worth speaking
of, that is--for over a week, and that it was high time to begin
again--‘with earnest endeavour’, Daisy said. So then Oswald said--

‘All right; but there ought to be an end to everything. Let’s each of us
think of one really noble and unselfish act, and the others shall help
to work it out, like we did when we were Treasure Seekers. Then when
everybody’s had their go-in we’ll write every single thing down in the
Golden Deed book, and we’ll draw two lines in red ink at the bottom,
like Father does at the end of an account. And after that, if anyone
wants to be good they can jolly well be good on our own, if at all.’

The ones who had made the Society did not welcome this wise idea, but
Dicky and Oswald were firm.

So they had to agree. When Oswald is really firm, opposingness and
obstinacy have to give way.

Dora said, ‘It would be a noble action to have all the school-children
from the village and give them tea and games in the paddock. They would
think it so nice and good of us.’

But Dicky showed her that this would not be OUR good act, but Father’s,
because he would have to pay for the tea, and he had already stood us
the keepsakes for the soldiers, as well as having to stump up heavily
over the coal barge. And it is in vain being noble and generous when
someone else is paying for it all the time, even if it happens to be
your father. Then three others had ideas at the same time and began to
explain what they were.

We were all in the dining-room, and perhaps we were making a bit of a
row. Anyhow, Oswald for one, does not blame Albert’s uncle for opening
his door and saying--

‘I suppose I must not ask for complete silence. That were too much.
But if you could whistle, or stamp with your feet, or shriek
or howl--anything to vary the monotony of your well-sustained
conversation.’

Oswald said kindly, ‘We’re awfully sorry. Are you busy?’

‘Busy?’ said Albert’s uncle. ‘My heroine is now hesitating on the verge
of an act which, for good or ill, must influence her whole subsequent
career. You wouldn’t like her to decide in the middle of such a row that
she can’t hear herself think?’

We said, ‘No, we wouldn’t.’

Then he said, ‘If any outdoor amusement should commend itself to you
this bright mid-summer day.’ So we all went out.

Then Daisy whispered to Dora--they always hang together. Daisy is not
nearly so white-micey as she was at first, but she still seems to fear
the deadly ordeal of public speaking. Dora said--

‘Daisy’s idea is a game that’ll take us all day. She thinks keeping out
of the way when he’s making his heroine decide right would be a noble
act, and fit to write in the Golden Book; and we might as well be
playing something at the same time.’

We all said ‘Yes, but what?’

There was a silent interval.

‘Speak up, Daisy, my child.’ Oswald said; ‘fear not to lay bare the
utmost thoughts of that faithful heart.’

Daisy giggled. Our own girls never giggle--they laugh right out or hold
their tongues. Their kind brothers have taught them this. Then Daisy
said--

‘If we could have a sort of play to keep us out of the way. I once read
a story about an animal race. Everybody had an animal, and they had to
go how they liked, and the one that got in first got the prize. There
was a tortoise in it, and a rabbit, and a peacock, and sheep, and dogs,
and a kitten.’

This proposal left us cold, as Albert’s uncle says, because we knew
there could not be any prize worth bothering about. And though you may
be ever ready and willing to do anything for nothing, yet if there’s
going to be a prize there must BE a prize and there’s an end of it.

Thus the idea was not followed up. Dicky yawned and said, ‘Let’s go into
the barn and make a fort.’

So we did, with straw. It does not hurt straw to be messed about with
like it does hay.

The downstairs--I mean down-ladder--part of the barn was fun too,
especially for Pincher. There was as good ratting there as you could
wish to see. Martha tried it, but she could not help running kindly
beside the rat, as if she was in double harness with it. This is the
noble bull-dog’s gentle and affectionate nature coming out. We all
enjoyed the ratting that day, but it ended, as usual, in the girls
crying because of the poor rats. Girls cannot help this; we must not
be waxy with them on account of it, they have their nature, the same as
bull-dogs have, and it is this that makes them so useful in smoothing
the pillows of the sick-bed and tending wounded heroes.

However, the forts, and Pincher, and the girls crying, and having to be
thumped on the back, passed the time very agreeably till dinner. There
was roast mutton with onion sauce, and a roly-poly pudding.

Albert’s uncle said we had certainly effaced ourselves effectually,
which means we hadn’t bothered.

So we determined to do the same during the afternoon, for he told us his
heroine was by no means out of the wood yet.

And at first it was easy. Jam roly gives you a peaceful feeling and you
do not at first care if you never play any runabout game ever any more.
But after a while the torpor begins to pass away. Oswald was the first
to recover from his.

He had been lying on his front part in the orchard, but now he turned
over on his back and kicked his legs up, and said--

‘I say, look here; let’s do something.’

Daisy looked thoughtful. She was chewing the soft yellow parts of grass,
but I could see she was still thinking about that animal race. So I
explained to her that it would be very poor fun without a tortoise and a
peacock, and she saw this, though not willingly.

It was H. O. who said--

‘Doing anything with animals is prime, if they only will. Let’s have a
circus!’

At the word the last thought of the pudding faded from Oswald’s memory,
and he stretched himself, sat up, and said--

‘Bully for H. O. Let’s!’

The others also threw off the heavy weight of memory, and sat up and
said ‘Let’s!’ too.

Never, never in all our lives had we had such a gay galaxy of animals at
our command. The rabbits and the guinea-pigs, and even all the bright,
glass-eyed, stuffed denizens of our late-lamented jungle paled into
insignificance before the number of live things on the farm.

(I hope you do not think that the words I use are getting too long. I
know they are the right words. And Albert’s uncle says your style is
always altered a bit by what you read. And I have been reading the
Vicomte de Bragelonne. Nearly all my new words come out of those.)

‘The worst of a circus is,’ Dora said, ‘that you’ve got to teach the
animals things. A circus where the performing creatures hadn’t learned
performing would be a bit silly. Let’s give up a week to teaching them
and then have the circus.’

Some people have no idea of the value of time. And Dora is one of those
who do not understand that when you want to do a thing you do want to,
and not to do something else, and perhaps your own thing, a week later.

Oswald said the first thing was to collect the performing animals.

‘Then perhaps,’ he said, ‘we may find that they have hidden talents
hitherto unsuspected by their harsh masters.’

So Denny took a pencil and wrote a list of the animals required. This is
it:

     LIST OF ANIMALS REQUISITE FOR THE
     CIRCUS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE

   1 Bull for bull-fight.
   1 Horse for ditto (if possible).
   1 Goat to do Alpine feats of daring.
   1 Donkey to play see-saw.
   2 White pigs--one to be Learned, and the other to play with the clown.
   Turkeys, as many as possible, because they can make a noise that
           that sounds like an audience applauding
   The dogs, for any odd parts.
   1 Large black pig--to be the Elephant in the procession.
   Calves (several) to be camels, and to stand on tubs.

Daisy ought to have been captain because it was partly her idea, but she
let Oswald be, because she is of a retiring character. Oswald said--

‘The first thing is to get all the creatures together; the paddock at
the side of the orchard is the very place, because the hedge is good all
round. When we’ve got the performers all there we’ll make a programme,
and then dress for our parts. It’s a pity there won’t be any audience
but the turkeys.’

We took the animals in their right order, according to Denny’s list. The
bull was the first. He is black. He does not live in the cowhouse with
the other horned people; he has a house all to himself two fields away.
Oswald and Alice went to fetch him. They took a halter to lead the bull
by, and a whip, not to hurt the bull with, but just to make him mind.

The others were to try to get one of the horses while we were gone.

Oswald as usual was full of bright ideas.

‘I daresay,’ he said, ‘the bull will be shy at first, and he’ll have to
be goaded into the arena.’

‘But goads hurt,’ Alice said.

‘They don’t hurt the bull,’ Oswald said; ‘his powerful hide is too
thick.’

‘Then why does he attend to it,’ Alice asked, ‘if it doesn’t hurt?’

‘Properly-brought-up bulls attend because they know they ought,’
Oswald said. ‘I think I shall ride the bull,’ the brave boy went on.
‘A bull-fight, where an intrepid rider appears on the bull, sharing its
joys and sorrows. It would be something quite new.’

‘You can’t ride bulls,’ Alice said; ‘at least, not if their backs are
sharp like cows.’

But Oswald thought he could. The bull lives in a house made of wood and
prickly furze bushes, and he has a yard to his house. You cannot climb
on the roof of his house at all comfortably.

When we got there he was half in his house and half out in his yard, and
he was swinging his tail because of the flies which bothered. It was a
very hot day.

‘You’ll see,’ Alice said, ‘he won’t want a goad. He’ll be so glad to
get out for a walk he’ll drop his head in my hand like a tame fawn, and
follow me lovingly all the way.’

Oswald called to him. He said, ‘Bull! Bull! Bull! Bull!’ because we did
not know the animal’s real name. The bull took no notice; then Oswald
picked up a stone and threw it at the bull, not angrily, but just to
make it pay attention. But the bull did not pay a farthing’s worth of
it. So then Oswald leaned over the iron gate of the bull’s yard and just
flicked the bull with the whiplash. And then the bull DID pay attention.
He started when the lash struck him, then suddenly he faced round,
uttering a roar like that of the wounded King of Beasts, and putting his
head down close to his feet he ran straight at the iron gate where we
were standing.

Alice and Oswald mechanically turned away; they did not wish to annoy
the bull any more, and they ran as fast as they could across the field
so as not to keep the others waiting.

As they ran across the field Oswald had a dream-like fancy that perhaps
the bull had rooted up the gate with one paralysing blow, and was now
tearing across the field after him and Alice, with the broken gate
balanced on its horns. We climbed the stile quickly and looked back; the
bull was still on the right side of the gate.

Oswald said, ‘I think we’ll do without the bull. He did not seem to want
to come. We must be kind to dumb animals.’

Alice said, between laughing and crying--

‘Oh, Oswald, how can you!’ But we did do without the bull, and we did
not tell the others how we had hurried to get back. We just said, ‘The
bull didn’t seem to care about coming.’

The others had not been idle. They had got old Clover, the cart-horse,
but she would do nothing but graze, so we decided not to use her in the
bull-fight, but to let her be the Elephant. The Elephant’s is a nice
quiet part, and she was quite big enough for a young one. Then the black
pig could be Learned, and the other two could be something else. They
had also got the goat; he was tethered to a young tree.

The donkey was there. Denny was leading him in the halter. The dogs were
there, of course--they always are.

So now we only had to get the turkeys for the applause and the calves
and pigs.

The calves were easy to get, because they were in their own house. There
were five. And the pigs were in their houses too. We got them out after
long and patient toil, and persuaded them that they wanted to go into
the paddock, where the circus was to be. This is done by pretending to
drive them the other way. A pig only knows two ways--the way you want
him to go, and the other. But the turkeys knew thousands of different
ways, and tried them all. They made such an awful row, we had to drop
all ideas of ever hearing applause from their lips, so we came away and
left them.

‘Never mind,’ H. O. said, ‘they’ll be sorry enough afterwards, nasty,
unobliging things, because now they won’t see the circus. I hope the
other animals will tell them about it.’

While the turkeys were engaged in baffling the rest of us, Dicky had
found three sheep who seemed to wish to join the glad throng, so we let
them.

Then we shut the gate of the paddock, and left the dumb circus
performers to make friends with each other while we dressed.

Oswald and H. O. were to be clowns. It is quite easy with Albert’s
uncle’s pyjamas, and flour on your hair and face, and the red they do
the brick-floors with.

Alice had very short pink and white skirts, and roses in her hair and
round her dress. Her dress was the pink calico and white muslin stuff
off the dressing-table in the girls’ room fastened with pins and tied
round the waist with a small bath towel. She was to be the Dauntless
Equestrienne, and to give her enhancing act a barebacked daring, riding
either a pig or a sheep, whichever we found was freshest and most
skittish. Dora was dressed for the Haute ecole, which means a
riding-habit and a high hat. She took Dick’s topper that he wears with
his Etons, and a skirt of Mrs Pettigrew’s. Daisy, dressed the same as
Alice, taking the muslin from Mrs Pettigrew’s dressing-table without
saying anything beforehand. None of us would have advised this, and
indeed we were thinking of trying to put it back, when Denny and Noel,
who were wishing to look like highwaymen, with brown-paper top-boots
and slouch hats and Turkish towel cloaks, suddenly stopped dressing and
gazed out of the window.

‘Krikey!’ said Dick, ‘come on, Oswald!’ and he bounded like an antelope
from the room.

Oswald and the rest followed, casting a hasty glance through the window.
Noel had got brown-paper boots too, and a Turkish towel cloak. H. O. had
been waiting for Dora to dress him up for the other clown. He had only
his shirt and knickerbockers and his braces on. He came down as he
was--as indeed we all did. And no wonder, for in the paddock, where the
circus was to be, a blood-thrilling thing had transpired. The dogs were
chasing the sheep. And we had now lived long enough in the country to
know the fell nature of our dogs’ improper conduct.

We all rushed into the paddock, calling to Pincher, and Martha, and
Lady. Pincher came almost at once. He is a well-brought-up dog--Oswald
trained him. Martha did not seem to hear. She is awfully deaf, but
she did not matter so much, because the sheep could walk away from her
easily. She has no pace and no wind. But Lady is a deer-hound. She
is used to pursuing that fleet and antlered pride of the forest--the
stag--and she can go like billyo. She was now far away in a distant
region of the paddock, with a fat sheep just before her in full flight.
I am sure if ever anybody’s eyes did start out of their heads with
horror, like in narratives of adventure, ours did then.

There was a moment’s pause of speechless horror. We expected to see Lady
pull down her quarry, and we know what a lot of money a sheep costs, to
say nothing of its own personal feelings.

Then we started to run for all we were worth. It is hard to run
swiftly as the arrow from the bow when you happen to be wearing pyjamas
belonging to a grown-up person--as I was--but even so I beat Dicky. He
said afterwards it was because his brown-paper boots came undone and
tripped him up. Alice came in third. She held on the dressing-table
muslin and ran jolly well. But ere we reached the fatal spot all was
very nearly up with the sheep. We heard a plop; Lady stopped and looked
round. She must have heard us bellowing to her as we ran. Then she came
towards us, prancing with happiness, but we said ‘Down!’ and ‘Bad dog!’
and ran sternly on.

When we came to the brook which forms the northern boundary of the
paddock we saw the sheep struggling in the water. It is not very deep,
and I believe the sheep could have stood up, and been well in its depth,
if it had liked, but it would not try.

It was a steepish bank. Alice and I got down and stuck our legs into the
water, and then Dicky came down, and the three of us hauled that sheep
up by its shoulders till it could rest on Alice and me as we sat on the
bank. It kicked all the time we were hauling. It gave one extra kick
at last, that raised it up, and I tell you that sopping wet, heavy,
panting, silly donkey of a sheep sat there on our laps like a pet dog;
and Dicky got his shoulder under it at the back and heaved constantly to
keep it from flumping off into the water again, while the others fetched
the shepherd.

When the shepherd came he called us every name you can think of, and
then he said--

‘Good thing master didn’t come along. He would ha’ called you some tidy
names.’

He got the sheep out, and took it and the others away. And the calves
too. He did not seem to care about the other performing animals.

Alice, Oswald and Dick had had almost enough circus for just then, so
we sat in the sun and dried ourselves and wrote the programme of the
circus. This was it:


               PROGRAMME

1. Startling leap from the lofty precipice by the performing sheep. Real
water, and real precipice. The gallant rescue. O. A. and D. Bastable.
(We thought we might as well put that in though it was over and had
happened accidentally.)

2. Graceful bare-backed equestrienne act on the trained pig, Eliza. A.
Bastable. 3. Amusing clown interlude, introducing trained dog, Pincher,
and the other white pig. H. O. and O. Bastable.

4. The See-Saw. Trained donkeys. (H. O. said we had only one donkey, so
Dicky said H. O. could be the other. When peace was restored we went on
to 5.)

5. Elegant equestrian act by D. Bastable. Haute ecole, on Clover, the
incomparative trained elephant from the plains of Venezuela.

6. Alpine feat of daring. The climbing of the Andes, by Billy, the
well-known acrobatic goat. (We thought we could make the Andes out of
hurdles and things, and so we could have but for what always happens.
(This is the unexpected. (This is a saying Father told me--but I see
I am three deep in brackets so I will close them before I get into any
more).).).

7. The Black but Learned Pig. [‘I daresay he knows something,’ Alice
said, ‘if we can only find out what.’ We DID find out all too soon.)


We could not think of anything else, and our things were nearly dry--all
except Dick’s brown-paper top-boots, which were mingled with the
gurgling waters of the brook.

We went back to the seat of action--which was the iron trough where the
sheep have their salt put--and began to dress up the creatures.

We had just tied the Union Jack we made out of Daisy’s flannel petticoat
and cetera, when we gave the soldiers the baccy, round the waist of the
Black and Learned Pig, when we heard screams from the back part of the
house, and suddenly we saw that Billy, the acrobatic goat, had got loose
from the tree we had tied him to. (He had eaten all the parts of its
bark that he could get at, but we did not notice it until next day, when
led to the spot by a grown-up.)

The gate of the paddock was open. The gate leading to the bridge that
goes over the moat to the back door was open too. We hastily proceeded
in the direction of the screams, and, guided by the sound, threaded
our way into the kitchen. As we went, Noel, ever fertile in melancholy
ideas, said he wondered whether Mrs Pettigrew was being robbed, or only
murdered.

In the kitchen we saw that Noel was wrong as usual. It was neither. Mrs
Pettigrew, screaming like a steam-siren and waving a broom, occupied
the foreground. In the distance the maid was shrieking in a hoarse and
monotonous way, and trying to shut herself up inside a clothes-horse on
which washing was being aired.

On the dresser--which he had ascended by a chair--was Billy, the
acrobatic goat, doing his Alpine daring act. He had found out his Andes
for himself, and even as we gazed he turned and tossed his head in a
way that showed us some mysterious purpose was hidden beneath his calm
exterior. The next moment he put his off-horn neatly behind the end
plate of the next to the bottom row, and ran it along against the wall.
The plates fell crashing on to the soup tureen and vegetable dishes
which adorned the lower range of the Andes.

Mrs Pettigrew’s screams were almost drowned in the discarding crash and
crackle of the falling avalanche of crockery.

Oswald, though stricken with horror and polite regret, preserved the
most dauntless coolness.

Disregarding the mop which Mrs Pettigrew kept on poking at the goat in
a timid yet cross way, he sprang forward, crying out to his trusty
followers, ‘Stand by to catch him!’

But Dick had thought of the same thing, and ere Oswald could carry out
his long-cherished and general-like design, Dicky had caught the goat’s
legs and tripped it up. The goat fell against another row of plates,
righted itself hastily in the gloomy ruins of the soup tureen and the
sauce-boats, and then fell again, this time towards Dicky. The two fell
heavily on the ground together. The trusty followers had been so struck
by the daring of Dicky and his lion-hearted brother, that they had not
stood by to catch anything.

The goat was not hurt, but Dicky had a sprained thumb and a lump on his
head like a black marble door-knob. He had to go to bed.

I will draw a veil and asterisks over what Mrs Pettigrew said. Also
Albert’s uncle, who was brought to the scene of ruin by her screams. Few
words escaped our lips. There are times when it is not wise to argue;
however, little what has occurred is really our fault.

When they had said what they deemed enough and we were let go, we all
went out. Then Alice said distractedly, in a voice which she vainly
strove to render firm--

‘Let’s give up the circus. Let’s put the toys back in the boxes--no,
I don’t mean that--the creatures in their places--and drop the whole
thing. I want to go and read to Dicky.’

Oswald has a spirit that no reverses can depreciate. He hates to be
beaten. But he gave in to Alice, as the others said so too, and we went
out to collect the performing troop and sort it out into its proper
places.

Alas! we came too late. In the interest we had felt about whether Mrs
Pettigrew was the abject victim of burglars or not, we had left both
gates open again. The old horse--I mean the trained elephant from
Venezuela--was there all right enough. The dogs we had beaten and tied
up after the first act, when the intrepid sheep bounded, as it says in
the programme. The two white pigs were there, but the donkey was gone.
We heard his hoofs down the road, growing fainter and fainter, in the
direction of the ‘Rose and Crown’. And just round the gatepost we saw
a flash of red and white and blue and black that told us, with dumb
signification, that the pig was off in exactly the opposite direction.
Why couldn’t they have gone the same way? But no, one was a pig and the
other was a donkey, as Denny said afterwards.

Daisy and H. O. started after the donkey; the rest of us, with one
accord, pursued the pig--I don’t know why. It trotted quietly down the
road; it looked very black against the white road, and the ends on the
top, where the Union Jack was tied, bobbed brightly as it trotted. At
first we thought it would be easy to catch up to it. This was an error.

When we ran faster it ran faster; when we stopped it stopped and looked
round at us, and nodded. (I daresay you won’t swallow this, but you may
safely. It’s as true as true, and so’s all that about the goat. I give
you my sacred word of honour.) I tell you the pig nodded as much as to
say--

‘Oh, yes. You think you will, but you won’t!’ and then as soon as we
moved again off it went. That pig led us on and on, o’er miles and miles
of strange country. One thing, it did keep to the roads. When we met
people, which wasn’t often, we called out to them to help us, but they
only waved their arms and roared with laughter. One chap on a bicycle
almost tumbled off his machine, and then he got off it and propped it
against a gate and sat down in the hedge to laugh properly. You remember
Alice was still dressed up as the gay equestrienne in the dressing-table
pink and white, with rosy garlands, now very droopy, and she had no
stockings on, only white sand-shoes, because she thought they would be
easier than boots for balancing on the pig in the graceful bare-backed
act.

Oswald was attired in red paint and flour and pyjamas, for a clown.
It is really IMPOSSIBLE to run speedfully in another man’s pyjamas,
so Oswald had taken them off, and wore his own brown knickerbockers
belonging to his Norfolks. He had tied the pyjamas round his neck, to
carry them easily. He was afraid to leave them in a ditch, as Alice
suggested, because he did not know the roads, and for aught he recked
they might have been infested with footpads. If it had been his own
pyjamas it would have been different. (I’m going to ask for pyjamas next
winter, they are so useful in many ways.)

Noel was a highwayman in brown-paper gaiters and bath towels and a
cocked hat of newspaper. I don’t know how he kept it on. And the pig was
encircled by the dauntless banner of our country. All the same, I think
if I had seen a band of youthful travellers in bitter distress about a
pig I should have tried to lend a helping hand and not sat roaring in
the hedge, no matter how the travellers and the pig might have been
dressed.

It was hotter than anyone would believe who has never had occasion to
hunt the pig when dressed for quite another part. The flour got out of
Oswald’s hair into his eyes and his mouth. His brow was wet with what
the village blacksmith’s was wet with, and not his fair brow alone. It
ran down his face and washed the red off in streaks, and when he
rubbed his eyes he only made it worse. Alice had to run holding the
equestrienne skirts on with both hands, and I think the brown-paper
boots bothered Noel from the first. Dora had her skirt over her arm and
carried the topper in her hand. It was no use to tell ourselves it was a
wild boar hunt--we were long past that.

At last we met a man who took pity on us. He was a kind-hearted man. I
think, perhaps, he had a pig of his own--or, perhaps, children. Honour
to his name!

He stood in the middle of the road and waved his arms. The pig
right-wheeled through a gate into a private garden and cantered up the
drive. We followed. What else were we to do, I should like to know?

The Learned Black Pig seemed to know its way. It turned first to the
right and then to the left, and emerged on a lawn.

‘Now, all together!’ cried Oswald, mustering his failing voice to give
the word of command. ‘Surround him!--cut off his retreat!’

We almost surrounded him. He edged off towards the house.

‘Now we’ve got him!’ cried the crafty Oswald, as the pig got on to a bed
of yellow pansies close against the red house wall.

All would even then have been well, but Denny, at the last, shrank from
meeting the pig face to face in a manly way. He let the pig pass him,
and the next moment, with a squeak that said ‘There now!’ as plain as
words, the pig bolted into a French window. The pursuers halted not.
This was no time for trivial ceremony. In another moment the pig was a
captive. Alice and Oswald had their arms round him under the ruins of a
table that had had teacups on it, and around the hunters and their prey
stood the startled members of a parish society for making clothes for
the poor heathen, that that pig had led us into the very midst of. They
were reading a missionary report or something when we ran our quarry
to earth under their table. Even as he crossed the threshold I heard
something about ‘black brothers being already white to the harvest’. All
the ladies had been sewing flannel things for the poor blacks while the
curate read aloud to them. You think they screamed when they saw the Pig
and Us? You are right.

On the whole, I cannot say that the missionary people behaved badly.
Oswald explained that it was entirely the pig’s doing, and asked pardon
quite properly for any alarm the ladies had felt; and Alice said how
sorry we were but really it was NOT our fault this time. The curate
looked a bit nasty, but the presence of ladies made him keep his hot
blood to himself.

When we had explained, we said, ‘Might we go?’ The curate said, ‘The
sooner the better.’ But the Lady of the House asked for our names and
addresses, and said she should write to our Father. (She did, and we
heard of it too.) They did not do anything to us, as Oswald at one time
believed to be the curate’s idea. They let us go.

And we went, after we had asked for a piece of rope to lead the pig by.

‘In case it should come back into your nice room,’ Alice said. ‘And that
would be such a pity, wouldn’t it?’

A little girl in a starched pinafore was sent for the rope. And as soon
as the pig had agreed to let us tie it round his neck we came away. The
scene in the drawing-room had not been long. The pig went slowly,

‘Like the meandering brook,’

Denny said. Just by the gate the shrubs rustled and opened, and the
little girl came out. Her pinafore was full of cake.

‘Here,’ she said. ‘You must be hungry if you’ve come all that way.

I think they might have given you some tea after all the trouble you’ve
had.’ We took the cake with correct thanks.

‘I wish I could play at circuses,’ she said. ‘Tell me about it.’

We told her while we ate the cake; and when we had done she said perhaps
it was better to hear about than do, especially the goat’s part and
Dicky’s.

‘But I do wish auntie had given you tea,’ she said.

We told her not to be too hard on her aunt, because you have to make
allowances for grown-up people. When we parted she said she would never
forget us, and Oswald gave her his pocket button-hook and corkscrew
combined for a keepsake.

Dicky’s act with the goat (which is true, and no kid) was the only thing
out of that day that was put in the Golden Deed book, and he put that in
himself while we were hunting the pig.

Alice and me capturing the pig was never put in. We would scorn to write
our own good actions, but I suppose Dicky was dull with us all away; and
you must pity the dull, and not blame them.

I will not seek to unfold to you how we got the pig home, or how the
donkey was caught (that was poor sport compared to the pig). Nor will I
tell you a word of all that was said and done to the intrepid hunters
of the Black and Learned. I have told you all the interesting part. Seek
not to know the rest. It is better buried in obliquity.


CHAPTER 7. BEING BEAVERS; OR, THE YOUNG EXPLORERS     (ARCTIC OR OTHERWISE)

You read in books about the pleasures of London, and about how people
who live in the country long for the gay whirl of fashion in town
because the country is so dull. I do not agree with this at all. In
London, or at any rate Lewisham, nothing happens unless you make it
happen; or if it happens it doesn’t happen to you, and you don’t know
the people it does happen to. But in the country the most interesting
events occur quite freely, and they seem to happen to you as much as to
anyone else. Very often quite without your doing anything to help.

The natural and right ways of earning your living in the country are
much jollier than town ones, too; sowing and reaping, and doing things
with animals, are much better sport than fishmongering or bakering or
oil-shopping, and those sort of things, except, of course, a plumber’s
and gasfitter’s, and he is the same in town or country--most interesting
and like an engineer.

I remember what a nice man it was that came to cut the gas off once
at our old house in Lewisham, when my father’s business was feeling
so poorly. He was a true gentleman, and gave Oswald and Dicky over
two yards and a quarter of good lead piping, and a brass tap that only
wanted a washer, and a whole handful of screws to do what we liked with.
We screwed the back door up with the screws, I remember, one night when
Eliza was out without leave. There was an awful row. We did not mean
to get her into trouble. We only thought it would be amusing for her to
find the door screwed up when she came down to take in the milk in the
morning. But I must not say any more about the Lewisham house. It is
only the pleasures of memory, and nothing to do with being beavers, or
any sort of exploring.

I think Dora and Daisy are the kind of girls who will grow up very good,
and perhaps marry missionaries. I am glad Oswald’s destiny looks at
present as if it might be different.

We made two expeditions to discover the source of the Nile (or the North
Pole), and owing to their habit of sticking together and doing dull and
praiseable things, like sewing, and helping with the cooking, and taking
invalid delicacies to the poor and indignant, Daisy and Dora were wholly
out of it both times, though Dora’s foot was now quite well enough to
have gone to the North Pole or the Equator either. They said they did
not mind the first time, because they like to keep themselves clean; it
is another of their queer ways. And they said they had had a better time
than us. (It was only a clergyman and his wife who called, and hot cakes
for tea.) The second time they said they were lucky not to have been in
it. And perhaps they were right. But let me to my narrating. I hope you
will like it. I am going to try to write it a different way, like the
books they give you for a prize at a girls’ school--I mean a ‘young
ladies’ school’, of course--not a high school. High schools are not
nearly so silly as some other kinds. Here goes:

‘“Ah, me!” sighed a slender maiden of twelve summers, removing her
elegant hat and passing her tapery fingers lightly through her fair
tresses, “how sad it is--is it not?--to see able-bodied youths and young
ladies wasting the precious summer hours in idleness and luxury.”

‘The maiden frowned reproachingly, but yet with earnest gentleness, at
the group of youths and maidens who sat beneath an umbragipeaous beech
tree and ate black currants.

‘“Dear brothers and sisters,” the blushing girl went on, “could we not,
even now, at the eleventh hour, turn to account these wasted lives of
ours, and seek some occupation at once improving and agreeable?”

‘“I do not quite follow your meaning, dear sister,” replied the
cleverest of her brothers, on whose brow--’


It’s no use. I can’t write like these books. I wonder how the books’
authors can keep it up.

What really happened was that we were all eating black currants in the
orchard, out of a cabbage leaf, and Alice said--

‘I say, look here, let’s do something. It’s simply silly to waste a day
like this. It’s just on eleven. Come on!’

And Oswald said, ‘Where to?’

This was the beginning of it.

The moat that is all round our house is fed by streams. One of them is
a sort of open overflow pipe from a good-sized stream that flows at the
other side of the orchard.

It was this stream that Alice meant when she said--

‘Why not go and discover the source of the Nile?’

Of course Oswald knows quite well that the source of the real live
Egyptian Nile is no longer buried in that mysteriousness where it lurked
undisturbed for such a long time. But he was not going to say so. It is
a great thing to know when not to say things.

‘Why not have it an Arctic expedition?’ said Dicky; ‘then we could take
an ice-axe, and live on blubber and things. Besides, it sounds cooler.’

‘Vote! vote!’ cried Oswald. So we did. Oswald, Alice, Noel, and Denny
voted for the river of the ibis and the crocodile. Dicky, H. O., and the
other girls for the region of perennial winter and rich blubber.

So Alice said, ‘We can decide as we go. Let’s start anyway.’

The question of supplies had now to be gone into. Everybody wanted to
take something different, and nobody thought the other people’s things
would be the slightest use. It is sometimes thus even with grown-up
expeditions. So then Oswald, who is equal to the hardest emergency that
ever emerged yet, said--

‘Let’s each get what we like. The secret storehouse can be the shed in
the corner of the stableyard where we got the door for the raft. Then
the captain can decide who’s to take what.’

This was done. You may think it but the work of a moment to fit out an
expedition, but this is not so, especially when you know not whether
your exploring party is speeding to Central Africa or merely to the
world of icebergs and the Polar bear.

Dicky wished to take the wood-axe, the coal hammer, a blanket, and a
mackintosh.

H. O. brought a large faggot in case we had to light fires, and a pair
of old skates he had happened to notice in the box-room, in case the
expedition turned out icy.

Noel had nicked a dozen boxes of matches, a spade, and a trowel, and had
also obtained--I know not by what means--a jar of pickled onions.

Denny had a walking-stick--we can’t break him of walking with it--a book
to read in case he got tired of being a discoverer, a butterfly net and
a box with a cork in it, a tennis ball, if we happened to want to play
rounders in the pauses of exploring, two towels and an umbrella in the
event of camping or if the river got big enough to bathe in or to be
fallen into.

Alice had a comforter for Noel in case we got late, a pair of scissors
and needle and cotton, two whole candles in case of caves.

And she had thoughtfully brought the tablecloth off the small table in
the dining-room, so that we could make all the things up into one bundle
and take it in turns to carry it.

Oswald had fastened his master mind entirely on grub. Nor had the others
neglected this.

All the stores for the expedition were put down on the tablecloth and
the corners tied up. Then it was more than even Oswald’s muscley arms
could raise from the ground, so we decided not to take it, but only the
best-selected grub. The rest we hid in the straw loft, for there are
many ups and downs in life, and grub is grub at any time, and so are
stores of all kinds. The pickled onions we had to leave, but not for
ever.

Then Dora and Daisy came along with their arms round each other’s necks
as usual, like a picture on a grocer’s almanac, and said they weren’t
coming.

It was, as I have said, a blazing hot day, and there were differences of
opinion among the explorers about what eatables we ought to have taken,
and H. O. had lost one of his garters and wouldn’t let Alice tie it up
with her handkerchief, which the gentle sister was quite willing to do.
So it was a rather gloomy expedition that set off that bright sunny day
to seek the source of the river where Cleopatra sailed in Shakespeare
(or the frozen plains Mr Nansen wrote that big book about).

But the balmy calm of peaceful Nature soon made the others less
cross--Oswald had not been cross exactly but only disinclined to do
anything the others wanted--and by the time we had followed the stream
a little way, and had seen a water-rat and shied a stone or two at him,
harmony was restored. We did not hit the rat.

You will understand that we were not the sort of people to have lived so
long near a stream without plumbing its depths. Indeed it was the same
stream the sheep took its daring jump into the day we had the circus.
And of course we had often paddled in it--in the shallower parts. But
now our hearts were set on exploring. At least they ought to have
been, but when we got to the place where the stream goes under a wooden
sheep-bridge, Dicky cried, ‘A camp! a camp!’ and we were all glad to sit
down at once. Not at all like real explorers, who know no rest, day or
night, till they have got there (whether it’s the North Pole, or the
central point of the part marked ‘Desert of Sahara’ on old-fashioned
maps).

The food supplies obtained by various members were good and plenty
of it. Cake, hard eggs, sausage-rolls, currants, lemon cheese-cakes,
raisins, and cold apple dumplings. It was all very decent, but Oswald
could not help feeling that the source of the Nile (or North Pole) was a
long way off, and perhaps nothing much when you got there.

So he was not wholly displeased when Denny said, as he lay kicking into
the bank when the things to eat were all gone--

‘I believe this is clay: did you ever make huge platters and bowls out
of clay and dry them in the sun? Some people did in a book called Foul
Play, and I believe they baked turtles, or oysters, or something, at the
same time.’

He took up a bit of clay and began to mess it about, like you do putty
when you get hold of a bit. And at once the heavy gloom that had hung
over the explorers became expelled, and we all got under the shadow of
the bridge and messed about with clay.

‘It will be jolly!’ Alice said, ‘and we can give the huge platters to
poor cottagers who are short of the usual sorts of crockery. That would
really be a very golden deed.’

It is harder than you would think when you read about it, to make huge
platters with clay. It flops about as soon as you get it any size,
unless you keep it much too thick, and then when you turn up the edges
they crack. Yet we did not mind the trouble. And we had all got our
shoes and stockings off. It is impossible to go on being cross when your
feet are in cold water; and there is something in the smooth messiness
of clay, and not minding how dirty you get, that would soothe the
savagest breast that ever beat.

After a bit, though, we gave up the idea of the huge platter and tried
little things. We made some platters--they were like flower-pot saucers;
and Alice made a bowl by doubling up her fists and getting Noel to slab
the clay on outside. Then they smoothed the thing inside and out with
wet fingers, and it was a bowl--at least they said it was. When we’d
made a lot of things we set them in the sun to dry, and then it seemed
a pity not to do the thing thoroughly. So we made a bonfire, and when it
had burnt down we put our pots on the soft, white, hot ashes among the
little red sparks, and kicked the ashes over them and heaped more fuel
over the top. It was a fine fire.

Then tea-time seemed as if it ought to be near, and we decided to come
back next day and get our pots.

As we went home across the fields Dicky looked back and said--

‘The bonfire’s going pretty strong.’

We looked. It was. Great flames were rising to heaven against the
evening sky. And we had left it,a smouldering flat heap.

‘The clay must have caught alight,’ H. O. said. ‘Perhaps it’s the kind
that burns. I know I’ve heard of fireclay. And there’s another sort you
can eat.’

‘Oh, shut up!’ Dicky said with anxious scorn.

With one accord we turned back. We all felt THE feeling--the one that
means something fatal being up and it being your fault.

‘Perhaps, Alice said, ‘a beautiful young lady in a muslin dress was
passing by, and a spark flew on to her, and now she is rolling in agony
enveloped in flames.’

We could not see the fire now, because of the corner of the wood, but we
hoped Alice was mistaken.

But when we got in sight of the scene of our pottering industry we saw
it was as bad nearly as Alice’s wild dream. For the wooden fence leading
up to the bridge had caught fire, and it was burning like billy oh.

Oswald started to run; so did the others. As he ran he said to himself,
‘This is no time to think about your clothes. Oswald, be bold!’

And he was.

Arrived at the site of the conflagration, he saw that caps or straw hats
full of water, however quickly and perseveringly given, would never put
the bridge out, and his eventful past life made him know exactly the
sort of wigging you get for an accident like this.

So he said, ‘Dicky, soak your jacket and mine in the stream and chuck
them along. Alice, stand clear, or your silly girl’s clothes’ll catch as
sure as fate.’

Dicky and Oswald tore off their jackets, so did Denny, but we would not
let him and H. O. wet theirs. Then the brave Oswald advanced warily to
the end of the burning rails and put his wet jacket over the end bit,
like a linseed poultice on the throat of a suffering invalid who has
got bronchitis. The burning wood hissed and smouldered, and Oswald fell
back, almost choked with the smoke. But at once he caught up the other
wet jacket and put it on another place, and of course it did the trick
as he had known it would do. But it was a long job, and the smoke in his
eyes made the young hero obliged to let Dicky and Denny take a turn
as they had bothered to do from the first. At last all was safe; the
devouring element was conquered. We covered up the beastly bonfire with
clay to keep it from getting into mischief again, and then Alice said--

‘Now we must go and tell.’

‘Of course,’ Oswald said shortly. He had meant to tell all the time.

So we went to the farmer who has the Moat House Farm, and we went at
once, because if you have any news like that to tell it only makes it
worse if you wait about. When we had told him he said--

‘You little ---.’ I shall not say what he said besides that, because
I am sure he must have been sorry for it next Sunday when he went to
church, if not before.

We did not take any notice of what he said, but just kept on saying how
sorry we were; and he did not take our apology like a man, but only
said he daresayed, just like a woman does. Then he went to look at his
bridge, and we went in to our tea. The jackets were never quite the same
again.

Really great explorers would never be discouraged by the daresaying of
a farmer, still less by his calling them names he ought not to. Albert’s
uncle was away so we got no double slating; and next day we started
again to discover the source of the river of cataracts (or the region of
mountain-like icebergs).

We set out, heavily provisioned with a large cake Daisy and Dora had
made themselves, and six bottles of ginger-beer. I think real explorers
most likely have their ginger-beer in something lighter to carry than
stone bottles. Perhaps they have it by the cask, which would come
cheaper; and you could make the girls carry it on their back, like in
pictures of the daughters of regiments.

We passed the scene of the devouring conflagration, and the thought
of the fire made us so thirsty we decided to drink the ginger-beer and
leave the bottles in a place of concealment. Then we went on, determined
to reach our destination, Tropic or Polar, that day.

Denny and H. O. wanted to stop and try to make a fashionable
watering-place at that part where the stream spreads out like a
small-sized sea, but Noel said, ‘No.’ We did not like fashionableness.

‘YOU ought to, at any rate,’ Denny said. ‘A Mr Collins wrote an Ode to
the Fashions, and he was a great poet.’

‘The poet Milton wrote a long book about Satan,’ Noel said, ‘but I’m not
bound to like HIM.’ I think it was smart of Noel.

‘People aren’t obliged to like everything they write about even, let
alone read,’ Alice said. ‘Look at “Ruin seize thee, ruthless king!”
 and all the pieces of poetry about war, and tyrants, and slaughtered
saints--and the one you made yourself about the black beetle, Noel.’

By this time we had got by the pondy place and the danger of delay was
past; but the others went on talking about poetry for quite a field and
a half, as we walked along by the banks of the stream. The stream was
broad and shallow at this part, and you could see the stones and
gravel at the bottom, and millions of baby fishes, and a sort of
skating-spiders walking about on the top of the water. Denny said the
water must be ice for them to be able to walk on it, and this showed we
were getting near the North Pole. But Oswald had seen a kingfisher by
the wood, and he said it was an ibis, so this was even.

When Oswald had had as much poetry as he could bear he said, ‘Let’s be
beavers and make a dam.’ And everybody was so hot they agreed joyously,
and soon our clothes were tucked up as far as they could go and our legs
looked green through the water, though they were pink out of it.

Making a dam is jolly good fun, though laborious, as books about beavers
take care to let you know.

Dicky said it must be Canada if we were beavers, and so it was on the
way to the Polar system, but Oswald pointed to his heated brow, and
Dicky owned it was warm for Polar regions. He had brought the ice-axe
(it is called the wood chopper sometimes), and Oswald, ever ready and
able to command, set him and Denny to cut turfs from the bank while we
heaped stones across the stream. It was clayey here, or of course dam
making would have been vain, even for the best-trained beaver.

When we had made a ridge of stones we laid turfs against them--nearly
across the stream, leaving about two feet for the water to go
through--then more stones, and then lumps of clay stamped down as hard
as we could. The industrious beavers spent hours over it, with only one
easy to eat cake in. And at last the dam rose to the level of the bank.
Then the beavers collected a great heap of clay, and four of them lifted
it and dumped it down in the opening where the water was running. It did
splash a little, but a true-hearted beaver knows better than to mind a
bit of a wetting, as Oswald told Alice at the time. Then with more clay
the work was completed. We must have used tons of clay; there was quite
a big long hole in the bank above the dam where we had taken it out.

When our beaver task was performed we went on, and Dicky was so hot he
had to take his jacket off and shut up about icebergs.

I cannot tell you about all the windings of the stream; it went through
fields and woods and meadows, and at last the banks got steeper and
higher, and the trees overhead darkly arched their mysterious branches,
and we felt like the princes in a fairy tale who go out to seek their
fortunes.

And then we saw a thing that was well worth coming all that way for; the
stream suddenly disappeared under a dark stone archway, and however much
you stood in the water and stuck your head down between your knees you
could not see any light at the other end.

The stream was much smaller than where we had been beavers.

Gentle reader, you will guess in a moment who it was that said--

‘Alice, you’ve got a candle. Let’s explore.’ This gallant proposal met
but a cold response. The others said they didn’t care much about it, and
what about tea?

I often think the way people try to hide their cowardliness behind their
teas is simply beastly.

Oswald took no notice. He just said, with that dignified manner, not at
all like sulking, which he knows so well how to put on--

‘All right. I’M going. If you funk it you’d better cut along home and
ask your nurses to put you to bed.’ So then, of course, they agreed
to go. Oswald went first with the candle. It was not comfortable; the
architect of that dark subterranean passage had not imagined anyone
would ever be brave enough to lead a band of beavers into its inky
recesses, or he would have built it high enough to stand upright in. As
it was, we were bent almost at a right angle, and this is very awkward
if for long.

But the leader pressed dauntlessly on, and paid no attention to the
groans of his faithful followers, nor to what they said about their
backs.

It really was a very long tunnel, though, and even Oswald was not sorry
to say, ‘I see daylight.’ The followers cheered as well as they could as
they splashed after him. The floor was stone as well as the roof, so it
was easy to walk on. I think the followers would have turned back if it
had been sharp stones or gravel.

And now the spot of daylight at the end of the tunnel grew larger and
larger, and presently the intrepid leader found himself blinking in the
full sun, and the candle he carried looked simply silly. He emerged,
and the others too, and they stretched their backs and the word ‘krikey’
fell from more than one lip. It had indeed been a cramping adventure.
Bushes grew close to the mouth of the tunnel, so we could not see much
landscape, and when we had stretched our backs we went on upstream and
nobody said they’d had jolly well enough of it, though in more than one
young heart this was thought.

It was jolly to be in the sunshine again. I never knew before how cold
it was underground. The stream was getting smaller and smaller.

Dicky said, ‘This can’t be the way. I expect there was a turning to
the North Pole inside the tunnel, only we missed it. It was cold enough
there.’

But here a twist in the stream brought us out from the bushes, and
Oswald said--

‘Here is strange, wild, tropical vegetation in the richest profusion.
Such blossoms as these never opened in a frigid what’s-its-name.’

It was indeed true. We had come out into a sort of marshy, swampy place
like I think, a jungle is, that the stream ran through, and it was
simply crammed with queer plants, and flowers we never saw before or
since. And the stream was quite thin. It was torridly hot, and softish
to walk on. There were rushes and reeds and small willows, and it was
all tangled over with different sorts of grasses--and pools here and
there. We saw no wild beasts, but there were more different kinds of
wild flies and beetles than you could believe anybody could bear, and
dragon-flies and gnats. The girls picked a lot of flowers. I know the
names of some of them, but I will not tell you them because this is
not meant to be instructing. So I will only name meadow-sweet, yarrow,
loose-strife, lady’s bed-straw and willow herb--both the larger and the
lesser.

Everyone now wished to go home. It was much hotter there than in natural
fields. It made you want to tear all your clothes off and play at
savages, instead of keeping respectable in your boots.

But we had to bear the boots because it was so brambly.

It was Oswald who showed the others how flat it would be to go home the
same way we came; and he pointed out the telegraph wires in the distance
and said--

‘There must be a road there, let’s make for it,’ which was quite a
simple and ordinary thing to say, and he does not ask for any credit for
it. So we sloshed along, scratching our legs with the brambles, and the
water squelched in our boots, and Alice’s blue muslin frock was torn all
over in those crisscross tears which are considered so hard to darn.

We did not follow the stream any more. It was only a trickle now, so we
knew we had tracked it to its source. And we got hotter and hotter and
hotter, and the dews of agony stood in beads on our brows and rolled
down our noses and off our chins. And the flies buzzed, and the gnats
stung, and Oswald bravely sought to keep up Dicky’s courage, when he
tripped on a snag and came down on a bramble bush, by saying--

‘You see it IS the source of the Nile we’ve discovered. What price North
Poles now?’

Alice said, ‘Ah, but think of ices! I expect Oswald wishes it HAD been
the Pole, anyway.’

Oswald is naturally the leader, especially when following up what is
his own idea, but he knows that leaders have other duties besides just
leading. One is to assist weak or wounded members of the expedition,
whether Polar or Equatorish.

So the others had got a bit ahead through Oswald lending the tottering
Denny a hand over the rough places. Denny’s feet hurt him, because when
he was a beaver his stockings had dropped out of his pocket, and boots
without stockings are not a bed of luxuriousness. And he is often
unlucky with his feet.

Presently we came to a pond, and Denny said--

‘Let’s paddle.’

Oswald likes Denny to have ideas; he knows it is healthy for the boy,
and generally he backs him up, but just now it was getting late and the
others were ahead, so he said--

‘Oh, rot! come on.’

Generally the Dentist would have; but even worms will turn if they are
hot enough, and if their feet are hurting them. ‘I don’t care, I shall!’
he said.

Oswald overlooked the mutiny and did not say who was leader. He just
said--

‘Well don’t be all day about it,’ for he is a kind-hearted boy and can
make allowances. So Denny took off his boots and went into the pool.
‘Oh, it’s ripping!’ he said. ‘You ought to come in.’

‘It looks beastly muddy,’ said his tolerating leader.

‘It is a bit,’ Denny said, ‘but the mud’s just as cool as the water, and
so soft, it squeezes between your toes quite different to boots.’

And so he splashed about, and kept asking Oswald to come along in.

But some unseen influence prevented Oswald doing this; or it may have
been because both his bootlaces were in hard knots.

Oswald had cause to bless the unseen influence, or the bootlaces, or
whatever it was.

Denny had got to the middle of the pool, and he was splashing about,
and getting his clothes very wet indeed, and altogether you would have
thought his was a most envious and happy state. But alas! the brightest
cloud had a waterproof lining. He was just saying--

‘You are a silly, Oswald. You’d much better--’ when he gave a
blood-piercing scream, and began to kick about.

‘What’s up?’ cried the ready Oswald; he feared the worst from the way
Denny screamed, but he knew it could not be an old meat tin in this
quiet and jungular spot, like it was in the moat when the shark bit
Dora.

‘I don’t know, it’s biting me. Oh, it’s biting me all over my legs! Oh,
what shall I do? Oh, it does hurt! Oh! oh! oh!’ remarked Denny, among
his screams, and he splashed towards the bank. Oswald went into the
water and caught hold of him and helped him out. It is true that Oswald
had his boots on, but I trust he would not have funked the unknown
terrors of the deep, even without his boots, I am almost sure he would
not have.

When Denny had scrambled and been hauled ashore, we saw with horror and
amaze that his legs were stuck all over with large black, slug-looking
things. Denny turned green in the face--and even Oswald felt a bit
queer, for he knew in a moment what the black dreadfulnesses were. He
had read about them in a book called Magnet Stories, where there was a
girl called Theodosia, and she could play brilliant trebles on the piano
in duets, but the other girl knew all about leeches which is much more
useful and golden deedy. Oswald tried to pull the leeches off, but they
wouldn’t, and Denny howled so he had to stop trying. He remembered from
the Magnet Stories how to make the leeches begin biting--the girl did it
with cream--but he could not remember how to stop them, and they had not
wanted any showing how to begin.

‘Oh, what shall I do? What shall I do? Oh, it does hurt! Oh, oh!’ Denny
observed, and Oswald said--

‘Be a man! Buck up! If you won’t let me take them off you’ll just have
to walk home in them.’

At this thought the unfortunate youth’s tears fell fast. But Oswald gave
him an arm, and carried his boots for him, and he consented to buck
up, and the two struggled on towards the others, who were coming back,
attracted by Denny’s yells. He did not stop howling for a moment, except
to breathe. No one ought to blame him till they have had eleven leeches
on their right leg and six on their left, making seventeen in all, as
Dicky said, at once.

It was lucky he did yell, as it turned out, because a man on the
road--where the telegraph wires were--was interested by his howls, and
came across the marsh to us as hard as he could. When he saw Denny’s
legs he said--

‘Blest if I didn’t think so,’ and he picked Denny up and carried him
under one arm, where Denny went on saying ‘Oh!’ and ‘It does hurt’ as
hard as ever.

Our rescuer, who proved to be a fine big young man in the bloom of
youth, and a farm-labourer by trade, in corduroys, carried the wretched
sufferer to the cottage where he lived with his aged mother; and then
Oswald found that what he had forgotten about the leeches was SALT. The
young man in the bloom of youth’s mother put salt on the leeches, and
they squirmed off, and fell with sickening, slug-like flops on the brick
floor.

Then the young man in corduroys and the bloom, etc., carried Denny home
on his back, after his legs had been bandaged up, so that he looked like
‘wounded warriors returning’.

It was not far by the road, though such a long distance by the way the
young explorers had come.

He was a good young man, and though, of course, acts of goodness are
their own reward, still I was glad he had the two half-crowns Albert’s
uncle gave him, as well as his own good act. But I am not sure Alice
ought to have put him in the Golden Deed book which was supposed to be
reserved for Us.

Perhaps you will think this was the end of the source of the Nile (or
North Pole). If you do, it only shows how mistaken the gentlest reader
may be.

The wounded explorer was lying with his wounds and bandages on the sofa,
and we were all having our tea, with raspberries and white currants,
which we richly needed after our torrid adventures, when Mrs Pettigrew,
the housekeeper, put her head in at the door and said--

‘Please could I speak to you half a moment, sir?’ to Albert’s uncle.
And her voice was the kind that makes you look at each other when the
grown-up has gone out, and you are silent, with your bread-and-butter
halfway to the next bite, or your teacup in mid flight to your lips.

It was as we suppose. Albert’s uncle did not come back for a long while.
We did not keep the bread-and-butter on the wing all that time, of
course, and we thought we might as well finish the raspberries and white
currants. We kept some for Albert’s uncle, of course, and they were the
best ones too but when he came back he did not notice our thoughtful
unselfishness.

He came in, and his face wore the look that means bed, and very likely
no supper.

He spoke, and it was the calmness of white-hot iron, which is something
like the calmness of despair. He said--

‘You have done it again. What on earth possessed you to make a dam?’

‘We were being beavers,’ said H. O., in proud tones. He did not see as
we did where Albert’s uncle’s tone pointed to.

‘No doubt,’ said Albert’s uncle, rubbing his hands through his hair. ‘No
doubt! no doubt! Well, my beavers, you may go and build dams with your
bolsters. Your dam stopped the stream; the clay you took for it left
a channel through which it has run down and ruined about seven pounds’
worth of freshly-reaped barley. Luckily the farmer found it out in time
or you might have spoiled seventy pounds’ worth. And you burned a bridge
yesterday.’

We said we were sorry. There was nothing else to say, only Alice added,
‘We didn’t MEAN to be naughty.’

‘Of course not,’ said Albert’s uncle, ‘you never do. Oh, yes, I’ll kiss
you--but it’s bed and it’s two hundred lines to-morrow, and the line
is--“Beware of Being Beavers and Burning Bridges. Dread Dams.” It will
be a capital exercise in capital B’s and D’s.’

We knew by that that, though annoyed, he was not furious; we went to
bed.

I got jolly sick of capital B’s and D’s before sunset on the morrow.
That night, just as the others were falling asleep, Oswald said--

‘I say.’

‘Well,’ retorted his brother.

‘There is one thing about it,’ Oswald went on, ‘it does show it was a
rattling good dam anyhow.’

And filled with this agreeable thought, the weary beavers (or explorers,
Polar or otherwise) fell asleep.



CHAPTER 8. THE HIGH-BORN BABE

It really was not such a bad baby--for a baby. Its face was round and
quite clean, which babies’ faces are not always, as I daresay you know
by your own youthful relatives; and Dora said its cape was trimmed with
real lace, whatever that may be--I don’t see myself how one kind of
lace can be realler than another. It was in a very swagger sort of
perambulator when we saw it; and the perambulator was standing quite by
itself in the lane that leads to the mill.

‘I wonder whose baby it is,’ Dora said. ‘Isn’t it a darling, Alice?’

Alice agreed to its being one, and said she thought it was most likely
the child of noble parents stolen by gipsies.

‘These two, as likely as not,’ Noel said. ‘Can’t you see something
crime-like in the very way they’re lying?’

They were two tramps, and they were lying on the grass at the edge of
the lane on the shady side fast asleep, only a very little further on
than where the Baby was. They were very ragged, and their snores did
have a sinister sound.

‘I expect they stole the titled heir at dead of night, and they’ve been
travelling hot-foot ever since, so now they’re sleeping the sleep
of exhaustedness,’ Alice said. ‘What a heart-rending scene when the
patrician mother wakes in the morning and finds the infant aristocrat
isn’t in bed with his mamma.’

The Baby was fast asleep or else the girls would have kissed it. They
are strangely fond of kissing. The author never could see anything in it
himself.

‘If the gipsies DID steal it,’ Dora said ‘perhaps they’d sell it to us.
I wonder what they’d take for it.’

‘What could you do with it if you’d got it?’ H. O. asked.

‘Why, adopt it, of course,’ Dora said. ‘I’ve often thought I should
enjoy adopting a baby. It would be a golden deed, too. We’ve hardly got
any in the book yet.’

‘I should have thought there were enough of us,’ Dicky said.

‘Ah, but you’re none of you babies,’ said Dora.

‘Unless you count H. O. as a baby: he behaves jolly like one sometimes.’

This was because of what had happened that morning when Dicky found
H. O. going fishing with a box of worms, and the box was the one Dicky
keeps his silver studs in, and the medal he got at school, and what is
left of his watch and chain. The box is lined with red velvet and it was
not nice afterwards. And then H. O. said Dicky had hurt him, and he was
a beastly bully, and he cried. We thought all this had been made up, and
were sorry to see it threaten to break out again. So Oswald said--

‘Oh, bother the Baby! Come along, do!’

And the others came.

We were going to the miller’s with a message about some flour that
hadn’t come, and about a sack of sharps for the pigs.

After you go down the lane you come to a clover-field, and then a
cornfield, and then another lane, and then it is the mill. It is a
jolly fine mill: in fact it is two--water and wind ones--one of each
kind--with a house and farm buildings as well. I never saw a mill like
it, and I don’t believe you have either.

If we had been in a story-book the miller’s wife would have taken us
into the neat sanded kitchen where the old oak settle was black
with time and rubbing, and dusted chairs for us--old brown Windsor
chairs--and given us each a glass of sweet-scented cowslip wine and
a thick slice of rich home-made cake. And there would have been fresh
roses in an old china bowl on the table. As it was, she asked us all
into the parlour and gave us Eiffel Tower lemonade and Marie biscuits.
The chairs in her parlour were ‘bent wood’, and no flowers, except some
wax ones under a glass shade, but she was very kind, and we were very
much obliged to her. We got out to the miller, though, as soon as we
could; only Dora and Daisy stayed with her, and she talked to them about
her lodgers and about her relations in London.

The miller is a MAN. He showed us all over the mills--both kinds--and
let us go right up into the very top of the wind-mill, and showed us
how the top moved round so that the sails could catch the wind, and
the great heaps of corn, some red and some yellow (the red is English
wheat), and the heaps slice down a little bit at a time into a square
hole and go down to the mill-stones. The corn makes a rustling soft
noise that is very jolly--something like the noise of the sea--and you
can hear it through all the other mill noises.

Then the miller let us go all over the water-mill. It is fairy palaces
inside a mill. Everything is powdered over white, like sugar on pancakes
when you are allowed to help yourself. And he opened a door and showed
us the great water-wheel working on slow and sure, like some great,
round, dripping giant, Noel said, and then he asked us if we fished.

‘Yes,’ was our immediate reply.

‘Then why not try the mill-pool?’ he said, and we replied politely; and
when he was gone to tell his man something we owned to each other that
he was a trump.

He did the thing thoroughly. He took us out and cut us ash saplings for
rods; he found us in lines and hooks, and several different sorts of
bait, including a handsome handful of meal-worms, which Oswald put loose
in his pocket.

When it came to bait, Alice said she was going home with Dora and Daisy.
Girls are strange, mysterious, silly things. Alice always enjoys a rat
hunt until the rat is caught, but she hates fishing from beginning to
end. We boys have got to like it. We don’t feel now as we did when
we turned off the water and stopped the competition of the competing
anglers. We had a grand day’s fishing that day. I can’t think what made
the miller so kind to us. Perhaps he felt a thrill of fellow-feeling in
his manly breast for his fellow-sportsmen, for he was a noble fisherman
himself.

We had glorious sport--eight roach, six dace, three eels, seven perch,
and a young pike, but he was so very young the miller asked us to put
him back, and of course we did. ‘He’ll live to bite another day,’ said
the miller.

The miller’s wife gave us bread and cheese and more Eiffel Tower
lemonade, and we went home at last, a little damp, but full of
successful ambition, with our fish on a string.

It had been a strikingly good time--one of those times that happen in
the country quite by themselves. Country people are much more friendly
than town people. I suppose they don’t have to spread their friendly
feelings out over so many persons, so it’s thicker, like a pound of
butter on one loaf is thicker than on a dozen. Friendliness in the
country is not scrape, like it is in London. Even Dicky and H. O. forgot
the affair of honour that had taken place in the morning. H. O. changed
rods with Dicky because H. O.’s was the best rod, and Dicky baited H.
O.’s hook for him, just like loving, unselfish brothers in Sunday School
magazines.

We were talking fishlikely as we went along down the lane and through
the cornfield and the cloverfield, and then we came to the other lane
where we had seen the Baby. The tramps were gone, and the perambulator
was gone, and, of course, the Baby was gone too.

‘I wonder if those gipsies HAD stolen the Baby?’ Noel said dreamily. He
had not fished much, but he had made a piece of poetry. It was this:


               ‘How I wish
               I was a fish.
               I would not look
               At your hook,
               But lie still and be cool
               At the bottom of the pool
               And when you went to look
               At your cruel hook,
               You would not find me there,
               So there!’


‘If they did steal the Baby,’ Noel went on, ‘they will be tracked by the
lordly perambulator. You can disguise a baby in rags and walnut juice,
but there isn’t any disguise dark enough to conceal a perambulator’s
person.’

‘You might disguise it as a wheel-barrow,’ said Dicky.

‘Or cover it with leaves,’ said H. O., ‘like the robins.’

We told him to shut up and not gibber, but afterwards we had to own that
even a young brother may sometimes talk sense by accident.

For we took the short cut home from the lane--it begins with a large gap
in the hedge and the grass and weeds trodden down by the hasty feet of
persons who were late for church and in too great a hurry to go round
by the road. Our house is next to the church, as I think I have said
before, some time.

The short cut leads to a stile at the edge of a bit of wood (the
Parson’s Shave, they call it, because it belongs to him). The wood has
not been shaved for some time, and it has grown out beyond the stile and
here, among the hazels and chestnuts and young dogwood bushes, we saw
something white. We felt it was our duty to investigate, even if the
white was only the under side of the tail of a dead rabbit caught in a
trap.

It was not--it was part of the perambulator. I forget whether I said
that the perambulator was enamelled white--not the kind of enamelling
you do at home with Aspinall’s and the hairs of the brush come out and
it is gritty-looking, but smooth, like the handles of ladies very best
lace parasols. And whoever had abandoned the helpless perambulator in
that lonely spot had done exactly as H. O. said, and covered it with
leaves, only they were green and some of them had dropped off.

The others were wild with excitement. Now or never, they thought, was a
chance to be real detectives. Oswald alone retained a calm exterior. It
was he who would not go straight to the police station.

He said: ‘Let’s try and ferret out something for ourselves before we
tell the police. They always have a clue directly they hear about the
finding of the body. And besides, we might as well let Alice be in
anything there is going. And besides, we haven’t had our dinners yet.’

This argument of Oswald’s was so strong and powerful--his arguments are
often that, as I daresay you have noticed--that the others agreed.
It was Oswald, too, who showed his artless brothers why they had much
better not take the deserted perambulator home with them.

‘The dead body, or whatever the clue is, is always left exactly as it is
found,’ he said, ‘till the police have seen it, and the coroner, and the
inquest, and the doctor, and the sorrowing relations. Besides, suppose
someone saw us with the beastly thing, and thought we had stolen it;
then they would say, “What have you done with the Baby?” and then where
should we be?’ Oswald’s brothers could not answer this question, but
once more Oswald’s native eloquence and far-seeing discerningness
conquered.

‘Anyway,’ Dicky said, ‘let’s shove the derelict a little further under
cover.’

So we did.

Then we went on home. Dinner was ready and so were Alice and Daisy, but
Dora was not there.

‘She’s got a--well, she’s not coming to dinner anyway,’ Alice said when
we asked. ‘She can tell you herself afterwards what it is she’s got.’

Oswald thought it was headache, or pain in the temper, or in the
pinafore, so he said no more, but as soon as Mrs Pettigrew had helped
us and left the room he began the thrilling tale of the forsaken
perambulator. He told it with the greatest thrillingness anyone could
have, but Daisy and Alice seemed almost unmoved. Alice said--

‘Yes, very strange,’ and things like that, but both the girls seemed
to be thinking of something else. They kept looking at each other and
trying not to laugh, so Oswald saw they had got some silly secret and he
said--

‘Oh, all right! I don’t care about telling you. I only thought you’d
like to be in it. It’s going to be a really big thing, with policemen in
it, and perhaps a judge.’

‘In what?’ H. O. said; ‘the perambulator?’

Daisy choked and then tried to drink, and spluttered and got purple, and
had to be thumped on the back. But Oswald was not appeased. When Alice
said, ‘Do go on, Oswald. I’m sure we all like it very much,’ he said--

‘Oh, no, thank you,’ very politely. ‘As it happens,’ he went on, ‘I’d
just as soon go through with this thing without having any girls in it.’

‘In the perambulator?’ said H. O. again.

‘It’s a man’s job,’ Oswald went on, without taking any notice of H. O.

‘Do you really think so,’ said Alice, ‘when there’s a baby in it?’

‘But there isn’t,’ said H. O., ‘if you mean in the perambulator.’

‘Blow you and your perambulator,’ said Oswald, with gloomy forbearance.

Alice kicked Oswald under the table and said--

‘Don’t be waxy, Oswald. Really and truly Daisy and I HAVE got a secret,
only it’s Dora’s secret, and she wants to tell you herself. If it was
mine or Daisy’s we’d tell you this minute, wouldn’t we, Mouse?’

‘This very second,’ said the White Mouse.

And Oswald consented to take their apologies.

Then the pudding came in, and no more was said except asking for things
to be passed--sugar and water, and bread and things.

Then when the pudding was all gone, Alice said--

‘Come on.’

And we came on. We did not want to be disagreeable, though really we
were keen on being detectives and sifting that perambulator to the
very dregs. But boys have to try to take an interest in their sisters’
secrets, however silly. This is part of being a good brother.

Alice led us across the field where the sheep once fell into the brook,
and across the brook by the plank. At the other end of the next field
there was a sort of wooden house on wheels, that the shepherd sleeps in
at the time of year when lambs are being born, so that he can see that
they are not stolen by gipsies before the owners have counted them.

To this hut Alice now led her kind brothers and Daisy’s kind brother.
‘Dora is inside,’ she said, ‘with the Secret. We were afraid to have it
in the house in case it made a noise.’

The next moment the Secret was a secret no longer, for we all beheld
Dora, sitting on a sack on the floor of the hut, with the Secret in her
lap.

It was the High-born Babe!

Oswald was so overcome that he sat down suddenly, just like Betsy
Trotwood did in David Copperfield, which just shows what a true author
Dickens is.

‘You’ve done it this time,’ he said. ‘I suppose you know you’re a
baby-stealer?’

‘I’m not,’ Dora said. ‘I’ve adopted him.’

‘Then it was you,’ Dicky said, ‘who scuttled the perambulator in the
wood?’

‘Yes,’ Alice said; ‘we couldn’t get it over the stile unless Dora put
down the Baby, and we were afraid of the nettles for his legs. His name
is to be Lord Edward.’

‘But, Dora--really, don’t you think--’

‘If you’d been there you’d have done the same,’ said Dora firmly. ‘The
gipsies had gone. Of course something had frightened them and they fled
from justice. And the little darling was awake and held out his arms to
me. No, he hasn’t cried a bit, and I know all about babies; I’ve often
nursed Mrs Simpkins’s daughter’s baby when she brings it up on Sundays.
They have bread and milk to eat. You take him, Alice, and I’ll go and
get some bread and milk for him.’

Alice took the noble brat. It was horribly lively, and squirmed about in
her arms, and wanted to crawl on the floor. She could only keep it quiet
by saying things to it a boy would be ashamed even to think of saying,
such as ‘Goo goo’, and ‘Did ums was’, and ‘Ickle ducksums, then’.

When Alice used these expressions the Baby laughed and chuckled and
replied--

‘Daddadda’, ‘Bababa’, or ‘Glueglue’.

But if Alice stopped her remarks for an instant the thing screwed its
face up as if it was going to cry, but she never gave it time to begin.

It was a rummy little animal.

Then Dora came back with the bread and milk, and they fed the noble
infant. It was greedy and slobbery, but all three girls seemed unable to
keep their eyes and hands off it. They looked at it exactly as if it was
pretty.

We boys stayed watching them. There was no amusement left for us
now, for Oswald saw that Dora’s Secret knocked the bottom out of the
perambulator.

When the infant aristocrat had eaten a hearty meal it sat on Alice’s lap
and played with the amber heart she wears that Albert’s uncle brought
her from Hastings after the business of the bad sixpence and the
nobleness of Oswald.

‘Now,’ said Dora, ‘this is a council, so I want to be business-like. The
Duckums Darling has been stolen away; its wicked stealers have deserted
the Precious. We’ve got it. Perhaps its ancestral halls are miles and
miles away. I vote we keep the little Lovey Duck till it’s advertised
for.’

‘If Albert’s uncle lets you,’ said Dicky darkly.

‘Oh, don’t say “you” like that,’ Dora said; ‘I want it to be all of our
baby. It will have five fathers and three mothers, and a grandfather and
a great Albert’s uncle, and a great grand-uncle. I’m sure Albert’s uncle
will let us keep it--at any rate till it’s advertised for.’

‘And suppose it never is,’ Noel said.

‘Then so much the better,’ said Dora, ‘the little Duckyux.’

She began kissing the baby again. Oswald, ever thoughtful, said--‘Well,
what about your dinner?’

‘Bother dinner!’ Dora said--so like a girl. ‘Will you all agree to be
his fathers and mothers?’

‘Anything for a quiet life,’ said Dicky, and Oswald said--

‘Oh, yes, if you like. But you’ll see we shan’t be allowed to keep it.’

‘You talk as if he was rabbits or white rats,’ said Dora, ‘and he’s
not--he’s a little man, he is.’

‘All right, he’s no rabbit, but a man. Come on and get some grub, Dora,’
rejoined the kind-hearted Oswald, and Dora did, with Oswald and the
other boys. Only Noel stayed with Alice. He really seemed to like the
baby. When I looked back he was standing on his head to amuse it, but
the baby did not seem to like him any better whichever end of him was
up.

Dora went back to the shepherd’s house on wheels directly she had had
her dinner. Mrs Pettigrew was very cross about her not being in to it,
but she had kept her some mutton hot all the same. She is a decent sort.
And there were stewed prunes. We had some to keep Dora company. Then we
boys went fishing again in the moat, but we caught nothing.

Just before tea-time we all went back to the hut, and before we got half
across the last field we could hear the howling of the Secret.

‘Poor little beggar,’ said Oswald, with manly tenderness. ‘They must be
sticking pins in it.’

We found the girls and Noel looking quite pale and breathless. Daisy was
walking up and down with the Secret in her arms. It looked like Alice in
Wonderland nursing the baby that turned into a pig. Oswald said so, and
added that its screams were like it too.

‘What on earth is the matter with it?’ he said.

‘_I_ don’t know,’ said Alice. ‘Daisy’s tired, and Dora and I are quite
worn out. He’s been crying for hours and hours. YOU take him a bit.’

‘Not me,’ replied Oswald, firmly, withdrawing a pace from the Secret.

Dora was fumbling with her waistband in the furthest corner of the hut.

‘I think he’s cold,’ she said. ‘I thought I’d take off my flannelette
petticoat, only the horrid strings got into a hard knot. Here, Oswald,
let’s have your knife.’

With the word she plunged her hand into Oswald’s jacket pocket, and next
moment she was rubbing her hand like mad on her dress, and screaming
almost as loud as the Baby. Then she began to laugh and to cry at the
same time. This is called hysterics.

Oswald was sorry, but he was annoyed too. He had forgotten that his
pocket was half full of the meal-worms the miller had kindly given him.
And, anyway, Dora ought to have known that a man always carries his
knife in his trousers pocket and not in his jacket one.

Alice and Daisy rushed to Dora. She had thrown herself down on the pile
of sacks in the corner. The titled infant delayed its screams for a
moment to listen to Dora’s, but almost at once it went on again.

‘Oh, get some water!’ said Alice. ‘Daisy, run!’

The White Mouse, ever docile and obedient, shoved the baby into the
arms of the nearest person, who had to take it or it would have fallen a
wreck to the ground. This nearest person was Oswald. He tried to pass
it on to the others, but they wouldn’t. Noel would have, but he was busy
kissing Dora and begging her not to. So our hero, for such I may perhaps
term him, found himself the degraded nursemaid of a small but furious
kid.

He was afraid to lay it down, for fear in its rage it should beat
its brains out against the hard earth, and he did not wish, however
innocently, to be the cause of its hurting itself at all. So he walked
earnestly up and down with it, thumping it unceasingly on the back,
while the others attended to Dora, who presently ceased to yell.

Suddenly it struck Oswald that the High-born also had ceased to yell. He
looked at it, and could hardly believe the glad tidings of his faithful
eyes. With bated breath he hastened back to the sheep-house.

The others turned on him, full of reproaches about the meal-worms and
Dora, but he answered without anger.

‘Shut up,’ he said in a whisper of imperial command. ‘Can’t you see it’s
GONE TO SLEEP?’

As exhausted as if they had all taken part in all the events of a very
long Athletic Sports, the youthful Bastables and their friends dragged
their weary limbs back across the fields. Oswald was compelled to go
on holding the titled infant, for fear it should wake up if it changed
hands, and begin to yell again. Dora’s flannelette petticoat had been
got off somehow--how I do not seek to inquire--and the Secret was
covered with it. The others surrounded Oswald as much as possible, with
a view to concealment if we met Mrs Pettigrew. But the coast was clear.
Oswald took the Secret up into his bedroom. Mrs Pettigrew doesn’t come
there much, it’s too many stairs.

With breathless precaution Oswald laid it down on his bed. It sighed,
but did not wake. Then we took it in turns to sit by it and see that it
did not get up and fling itself out of bed, which, in one of its furious
fits, it would just as soon have done as not.

We expected Albert’s uncle every minute.

At last we heard the gate, but he did not come in, so we looked out and
saw that there he was talking to a distracted-looking man on a piebald
horse--one of the miller’s horses.

A shiver of doubt coursed through our veins. We could not remember
having done anything wrong at the miller’s. But you never know. And it
seemed strange his sending a man up on his own horse. But when we had
looked a bit longer our fears went down and our curiosity got up. For we
saw that the distracted one was a gentleman.

Presently he rode off, and Albert’s uncle came in. A deputation met him
at the door--all the boys and Dora, because the baby was her idea.

‘We’ve found something,’ Dora said, ‘and we want to know whether we may
keep it.’

The rest of us said nothing. We were not so very extra anxious to keep
it after we had heard how much and how long it could howl. Even Noel had
said he had no idea a baby could yell like it. Dora said it only cried
because it was sleepy, but we reflected that it would certainly be
sleepy once a day, if not oftener.

‘What is it?’ said Albert’s uncle. ‘Let’s see this treasure-trove. Is it
a wild beast?’

‘Come and see,’ said Dora, and we led him to our room.

Alice turned down the pink flannelette petticoat with silly pride, and
showed the youthful heir fatly and pinkly sleeping.

‘A baby!’ said Albert’s uncle. ‘THE Baby! Oh, my cat’s alive!’

That is an expression which he uses to express despair unmixed with
anger.

‘Where did you?--but that doesn’t matter. We’ll talk of this later.’

He rushed from the room, and in a moment or two we saw him mount his
bicycle and ride off.

Quite shortly he returned with the distracted horse-man.

It was HIS baby, and not titled at all. The horseman and his wife were
the lodgers at the mill. The nursemaid was a girl from the village.

She SAID she only left the Baby five minutes while she went to speak to
her sweetheart who was gardener at the Red House. But we knew she left
it over an hour, and nearly two.

I never saw anyone so pleased as the distracted horseman.

When we were asked we explained about having thought the Baby was the
prey of gipsies, and the distracted horseman stood hugging the Baby, and
actually thanked us.

But when he had gone we had a brief lecture on minding our own business.
But Dora still thinks she was right. As for Oswald and most of the
others, they agreed that they would rather mind their own business all
their lives than mind a baby for a single hour.

If you have never had to do with a baby in the frenzied throes of
sleepiness you can have no idea what its screams are like.

If you have been through such a scene you will understand how we managed
to bear up under having no baby to adopt. Oswald insisted on having the
whole thing written in the Golden Deed book. Of course his share could
not be put in without telling about Dora’s generous adopting of the
forlorn infant outcast, and Oswald could not and cannot forget that he
was the one who did get that baby to sleep.

What a time Mr and Mrs Distracted Horseman must have of it,
though--especially now they’ve sacked the nursemaid.

If Oswald is ever married--I suppose he must be some day--he will have
ten nurses to each baby. Eight is not enough. We know that because we
tried, and the whole eight of us were not enough for the needs of that
deserted infant who was not so extra high-born after all.



CHAPTER 9. HUNTING THE FOX

It is idle to expect everyone to know everything in the world without
being told. If we had been brought up in the country we should have
known that it is not done--to hunt the fox in August. But in the
Lewisham Road the most observing boy does not notice the dates when it
is proper to hunt foxes.

And there are some things you cannot bear to think that anybody would
think you would do; that is why I wish to say plainly at the very
beginning that none of us would have shot a fox on purpose even to save
our skins. Of course, if a man were at bay in a cave, and had to defend
girls from the simultaneous attack of a herd of savage foxes it would be
different. A man is bound to protect girls and take care of them--they
can jolly well take care of themselves really it seems to me--still,
this is what Albert’s uncle calls one of the ‘rules of the game’, so we
are bound to defend them and fight for them to the death, if needful.
Denny knows a quotation which says--

     ‘What dire offence from harmless causes springs,
     What mighty contests rise from trefoil things.’

He says this means that all great events come from three
things--threefold, like the clover or trefoil, and the causes are always
harmless. Trefoil is short for threefold.

There were certainly three things that led up to the adventure which is
now going to be told you. The first was our Indian uncle coming down to
the country to see us. The second was Denny’s tooth. The third was only
our wanting to go hunting; but if you count it in it makes the thing
about the trefoil come right. And all these causes were harmless.

It is a flattering thing to say, and it was not Oswald who said it, but
Dora. She said she was certain our uncle missed us, and that he felt he
could no longer live without seeing his dear ones (that was us).

Anyway, he came down, without warning, which is one of the few bad
habits that excellent Indian man has, and this habit has ended in
unpleasantness more than once, as when we played jungles.

However, this time it was all right. He came on rather a dull kind of
day, when no one had thought of anything particularly amusing to do. So
that, as it happened to be dinner-time and we had just washed our hands
and faces, we were all spotlessly clean (com-pared with what we are
sometimes, I mean, of course).

We were just sitting down to dinner, and Albert’s uncle was just
plunging the knife into the hot heart of the steak pudding, when there
was the rumble of wheels, and the station fly stopped at the garden
gate. And in the fly, sitting very upright, with his hands on his knees,
was our Indian relative so much beloved. He looked very smart, with a
rose in his buttonhole. How different from what he looked in other days
when he helped us to pretend that our currant pudding was a wild boar
we were killing with our forks. Yet, though tidier, his heart still beat
kind and true. You should not judge people harshly because their clothes
are tidy. He had dinner with us, and then we showed him round the place,
and told him everything we thought he would like to hear, and about the
Tower of Mystery, and he said--

‘It makes my blood boil to think of it.’

Noel said he was sorry for that, because everyone else we had told it to
had owned, when we asked them, that it froze their blood.

‘Ah,’ said the Uncle, ‘but in India we learn how to freeze our blood and
boil it at the same time.’

In those hot longitudes, perhaps, the blood is always near
boiling-point, which accounts for Indian tempers, though not for the
curry and pepper they eat. But I must not wander; there is no curry at
all in this story. About temper I will not say.

Then Uncle let us all go with him to the station when the fly came back
for him; and when we said good-bye he tipped us all half a quid, without
any insidious distinctions about age or considering whether you were a
boy or a girl. Our Indian uncle is a true-born Briton, with no nonsense
about him.

We cheered him like one man as the train went off, and then we offered
the fly-driver a shilling to take us back to the four cross-roads, and
the grateful creature did it for nothing because, he said, the gent had
tipped him something like. How scarce is true gratitude! So we cheered
the driver too for this rare virtue, and then went home to talk about
what we should do with our money. I cannot tell you all that we did with
it, because money melts away ‘like snow-wreaths in thaw-jean’, as Denny
says, and somehow the more you have the more quickly it melts. We
all went into Maidstone, and came back with the most beautiful lot of
brown-paper parcels, with things inside that supplied long-felt wants.
But none of them belongs to this narration, except what Oswald and Denny
clubbed to buy.

This was a pistol, and it took all the money they both had, but when
Oswald felt the uncomfortable inside sensation that reminds you who it
is and his money that are soon parted he said to himself--

‘I don’t care. We ought to have a pistol in the house, and one that
will go off, too--not those rotten flintlocks. Suppose there should be
burglars and us totally unarmed?’

We took it in turns to have the pistol, and we decided always to
practise with it far from the house, so as not to frighten the
grown-ups, who are always much nervouser about firearms than we are.

It was Denny’s idea getting it; and Oswald owns it surprised him, but
the boy was much changed in his character. We got it while the others
were grubbing at the pastry-cook’s in the High Street, and we said
nothing till after tea, though it was hard not to fire at the birds on
the telegraph wires as we came home in the train.

After tea we called a council in the straw-loft, and Oswald said--

‘Denny and I have got a secret.’

‘I know what it is,’ Dicky said contemptibly. ‘You’ve found out that
shop in Maidstone where peppermint rock is four ounces a penny. H. O.
and I found it out before you did.’

Oswald said, ‘You shut-up. If you don’t want to hear the secret you’d
better bunk. I’m going to administer the secret oath.’

This is a very solemn oath, and only used about real things, and never
for pretending ones, so Dicky said--

‘Oh, all right; go ahead! I thought you were only rotting.’

So they all took the secret oath. Noel made it up long before, when he
had found the first thrush’s nest we ever saw in the Blackheath garden:


     ‘I will not tell, I will not reveal,
     I will not touch, or try to steal;
     And may I be called a beastly sneak,
     If this great secret I ever repeat.’

It is a little wrong about the poetry, but it is a very binding promise.
They all repeated it, down to H. O.

‘Now then,’ Dicky said, ‘what’s up?’

Oswald, in proud silence, drew the pistol from his breast and held it
out, and there was a murmur of awful amazement and respect from every
one of the council. The pistol was not loaded, so we let even the girls
have it to look at. And then Dicky said, ‘Let’s go hunting.’

And we decided that we would. H. O. wanted to go down to the village and
get penny horns at the shop for the huntsmen to wind, like in the song,
but we thought it would be more modest not to wind horns or anything
noisy, at any rate not until we had run down our prey. But his talking
of the song made us decide that it was the fox we wanted to hunt. We had
not been particular which animal we hunted before that.

Oswald let Denny have first go with the pistol, and when we went to bed
he slept with it under his pillow, but not loaded, for fear he should
have a nightmare and draw his fell weapon before he was properly awake.

Oswald let Denny have it, because Denny had toothache, and a pistol is
consoling though it does not actually stop the pain of the tooth. The
toothache got worse, and Albert’s uncle looked at it, and said it was
very loose, and Denny owned he had tried to crack a peach-stone with it.
Which accounts. He had creosote and camphor, and went to bed early, with
his tooth tied up in red flannel.

Oswald knows it is right to be very kind when people are ill, and he
forbore to wake the sufferer next morning by buzzing a pillow at him, as
he generally does. He got up and went over to shake the invalid, but
the bird had flown and the nest was cold. The pistol was not in the nest
either, but Oswald found it afterwards under the looking-glass on the
dressing-table. He had just awakened the others (with a hair-brush
because they had not got anything the matter with their teeth), when he
heard wheels, and, looking out, beheld Denny and Albert’s uncle being
driven from the door in the farmer’s high cart with the red wheels.

We dressed extra quick, so as to get downstairs to the bottom of the
mystery. And we found a note from Albert’s uncle. It was addressed to
Dora, and said--

‘Denny’s toothache got him up in the small hours. He’s off to the
dentist to have it out with him, man to man. Home to dinner.’

Dora said, ‘Denny’s gone to the dentist.’

‘I expect it’s a relation,’ H. O. said. ‘Denny must be short for
Dentist.’

I suppose he was trying to be funny--he really does try very hard. He
wants to be a clown when he grows up. The others laughed.

‘I wonder,’ said Dicky, ‘whether he’ll get a shilling or half-a-crown
for it.’

Oswald had been meditating in gloomy silence, now he cheered up and
said--

‘Of course! I’d forgotten that. He’ll get his tooth money, and the drive
too. So it’s quite fair for us to have the fox-hunt while he’s gone. I
was thinking we should have to put it off.’

The others agreed that it would not be unfair.

‘We can have another one another time if he wants to,’ Oswald said.

We know foxes are hunted in red coats and on horseback--but we could
not do this--but H. O. had the old red football jersey that was Albert’s
uncle’s when he was at Loretto. He was pleased.

‘But I do wish we’d had horns,’ he said grievingly. ‘I should have liked
to wind the horn.’

‘We can pretend horns,’ Dora said; but he answered, ‘I didn’t want to
pretend. I wanted to wind something.’

‘Wind your watch,’ Dicky said. And that was unkind, because we all know
H. O.’s watch is broken, and when you wind it, it only rattles inside
without going in the least.

We did not bother to dress up much for the hunting expedition--just
cocked hats and lath swords; and we tied a card on to H. O.’s chest with
‘Moat House Fox-Hunters’ on it; and we tied red flannel round all the
dogs’ necks to show they were fox-hounds. Yet it did not seem to show it
plainly; somehow it made them look as if they were not fox-hounds, but
their own natural breeds--only with sore throats.

Oswald slipped the pistol and a few cartridges into his pocket. He knew,
of course, that foxes are not shot; but as he said--

‘Who knows whether we may not meet a bear or a crocodile.’

We set off gaily. Across the orchard and through two cornfields, and
along the hedge of another field, and so we got into the wood, through
a gap we had happened to make a day or two before, playing ‘follow my
leader’.

The wood was very quiet and green; the dogs were happy and most busy.
Once Pincher started a rabbit. We said, ‘View Halloo!’ and immediately
started in pursuit; but the rabbit went and hid, so that even Pincher
could not find him, and we went on. But we saw no foxes. So at last we
made Dicky be a fox, and chased him down the green rides. A wide walk
in a wood is called a ride, even if people never do anything but walk in
it.

We had only three hounds--Lady, Pincher and Martha--so we joined the
glad throng and were being hounds as hard as we could, when we suddenly
came barking round a corner in full chase and stopped short, for we
saw that our fox had stayed his hasty flight. The fox was stooping over
something reddish that lay beside the path, and he cried--

‘I say, look here!’ in tones that thrilled us throughout.

Our fox--whom we must now call Dicky, so as not to muddle the
narration--pointed to the reddy thing that the dogs were sniffing at.

‘It’s a real live fox,’ he said. And so it was. At least it was
real--only it was quite dead--and when Oswald lifted it up its head
was bleeding. It had evidently been shot through the brain and expired
instantly. Oswald explained this to the girls when they began to cry at
the sight of the poor beast; I do not say he did not feel a bit sorry
himself.

The fox was cold, but its fur was so pretty, and its tail and its little
feet. Dicky strung the dogs on the leash; they were so much interested
we thought it was better.

‘It does seem horrid to think it’ll never see again out of its poor
little eyes,’ Dora said, blowing her nose.

‘And never run about through the wood again, lend me your hanky, Dora’
said Alice.

‘And never be hunted or get into a hen-roost or a trap or anything
exciting, poor little thing,’ said Dicky.

The girls began to pick green chestnut leaves to cover up the poor fox’s
fatal wound, and Noel began to walk up and down making faces, the way
he always does when he’s making poetry. He cannot make one without the
other. It works both ways, which is a comfort.

‘What are we going to do now?’ H. O. said; ‘the huntsman ought to cut
off its tail, I’m quite certain. Only, I’ve broken the big blade of my
knife, and the other never was any good.’

The girls gave H. O. a shove, and even Oswald said, ‘Shut up’, for
somehow we all felt we did not want to play fox-hunting any more that
day. When his deadly wound was covered the fox hardly looked dead at
all.

‘Oh, I wish it wasn’t true!’ Alice said.

Daisy had been crying all the time, and now she said, ‘I should like to
pray God to make it not true.’

But Dora kissed her, and told her that was no good--only she might pray
God to take care of the fox’s poor little babies, if it had had any,
which I believe she has done ever since.

‘If only we could wake up and find it was a horrid dream,’ Alice said.

It seems silly that we should have cared so much when we had really set
out to hunt foxes with dogs, but it is true. The fox’s feet looked so
helpless. And there was a dusty mark on its side that I know would not
have been there if it had been alive and able to wash itself.

Noel now said, ‘This is the piece of poetry’:


     ‘Here lies poor Reynard who is slain,
     He will not come to life again.
     I never will the huntsman’s horn
     Wind since the day that I was born
     Until the day I die--
     For I don’t like hunting, and this is why.’


‘Let’s have a funeral,’ said H. O. This pleased everybody, and we got
Dora to take off her petticoat to wrap the fox in, so that we could
carry it to our garden and bury it without bloodying our jackets. Girls’
clothes are silly in one way, but I think they are useful too. A boy
cannot take off more than his jacket and waistcoat in any emergency,
or he is at once entirely undressed. But I have known Dora take off
two petticoats for useful purposes and look just the same outside
afterwards.

We boys took it in turns to carry the fox. It was very heavy. When we
got near the edge of the wood Noel said--

‘It would be better to bury it here, where the leaves can talk funeral
songs over its grave for ever, and the other foxes can come and cry if
they want to.’ He dumped the fox down on the moss under a young oak tree
as he spoke.

‘If Dicky fetched the spade and fork we could bury it here, and then he
could tie up the dogs at the same time.’

‘You’re sick of carrying it,’ Dicky remarked, ‘that’s what it is.’ But
he went on condition the rest of us boys went too.

While we were gone the girls dragged the fox to the edge of the wood;
it was a different edge to the one we went in by--close to a lane--and
while they waited for the digging or fatigue party to come back, they
collected a lot of moss and green things to make the fox’s long home
soft for it to lie in. There are no flowers in the woods in August,
which is a pity.

When we got back with the spade and fork we dug a hole to bury the fox
in. We did not bring the dogs back, because they were too interested in
the funeral to behave with real, respectable calmness.

The ground was loose and soft and easy to dig when we had scraped away
the broken bits of sticks and the dead leaves and the wild honeysuckle;
Oswald used the fork and Dicky had the spade. Noel made faces and
poetry--he was struck so that morning--and the girls sat stroking the
clean parts of the fox’s fur till the grave was deep enough. At last it
was; then Daisy threw in the leaves and grass, and Alice and Dora took
the poor dead fox by his two ends and we helped to put him in the
grave. We could not lower him slowly--he was dropped in, really. Then we
covered the furry body with leaves, and Noel said the Burial Ode he had
made up. He says this was it, but it sounds better now than it did then,
so I think he must have done something to it since:


               THE FOX’S BURIAL ODE


      'Dear Fox, sleep here, and do not wake,
      We picked these leaves for your sake
      You must not try to rise or move,
      We give you this with our love.
      Close by the wood where once you grew
      Your mourning friends have buried you.
      If you had lived you'd not have been
      (Been proper friends with us, I mean),
      But now you're laid upon the shelf,
      Poor fox, you cannot help yourself,
      So, as I say, we are your loving friends--
      And here your
      Burial Ode, dear Foxy, ends.
      P. S.--When in the moonlight bright
      The foxes wander of a night,
      They'll pass your grave and fondly think of you,
      Exactly like we mean to always do.
      So now, dear fox, adieu!
      Your friends are few
      But true To you.
      Adieu!'

When this had been said we filled in the grave and covered the top of
it with dry leaves and sticks to make it look like the rest of the wood.
People might think it was a treasure, and dig it up, if they thought
there was anything buried there, and we wished the poor fox to sleep
sound and not to be disturbed.

The interring was over. We folded up Dora’s bloodstained pink cotton
petticoat, and turned to leave the sad spot.

We had not gone a dozen yards down the lane when we heard footsteps and
a whistle behind us, and a scrabbling and whining, and a gentleman with
two fox-terriers had called a halt just by the place where we had laid
low the ‘little red rover’.

The gentleman stood in the lane, but the dogs were digging--we could see
their tails wagging and see the dust fly. And we SAW WHERE. We ran back.

‘Oh, please, do stop your dogs digging there!’ Alice said.

The gentleman said ‘Why?’

‘Because we’ve just had a funeral, and that’s the grave.’

The gentleman whistled, but the fox-terriers were not trained like
Pincher, who was brought up by Oswald. The gentleman took a stride
through the hedge gap.

‘What have you been burying--pet dicky bird, eh?’ said the gentleman,
kindly. He had riding breeches and white whiskers.

We did not answer, because now, for the first time, it came over all of
us, in a rush of blushes and uncomfortableness, that burying a fox is a
suspicious act. I don’t know why we felt this, but we did.

Noel said dreamily--

     ‘We found his murdered body in the wood,
      And dug a grave by which the mourners stood.’

But no one heard him except Oswald, because Alice and Dora and Daisy
were all jumping about with the jumps of unrestrained anguish, and
saying, ‘Oh, call them off! Do! do!--oh, don’t, don’t! Don’t let them
dig.’

Alas! Oswald was, as usual, right. The ground of the grave had not been
trampled down hard enough, and he had said so plainly at the time,
but his prudent counsels had been overruled. Now these busy-bodying,
meddling, mischief-making fox-terriers (how different from Pincher, who
minds his own business unless told otherwise) had scratched away the
earth and laid bare the reddish tip of the poor corpse’s tail.

We all turned to go without a word, it seemed to be no use staying any
longer.

But in a moment the gentleman with the whiskers had got Noel and Dicky
each by an ear--they were nearest him. H. O. hid in the hedge. Oswald,
to whose noble breast sneakishness is, I am thankful to say, a stranger,
would have scorned to escape, but he ordered his sisters to bunk in a
tone of command which made refusal impossible.

‘And bunk sharp, too’ he added sternly. ‘Cut along home.’

So they cut. The white-whiskered gentleman now encouraged his angry
fox-terriers, by every means at his command, to continue their vile and
degrading occupation; holding on all the time to the ears of Dicky and
Noel, who scorned to ask for mercy. Dicky got purple and Noel got white.
It was Oswald who said--

‘Don’t hang on to them, sir. We won’t cut. I give you my word of
honour.’

‘YOUR word of honour,’ said the gentleman, in tones for which, in
happier days, when people drew their bright blades and fought duels, I
would have had his heart’s dearest blood. But now Oswald remained calm
and polite as ever.

‘Yes, on my honour,’ he said, and the gentleman dropped the ears of
Oswald’s brothers at the sound of his firm, unswerving tones. He dropped
the ears and pulled out the body of the fox and held it up.

The dogs jumped up and yelled.

‘Now,’ he said, ‘you talk very big about words of honour. Can you speak
the truth?’

Dickie said, ‘If you think we shot it, you’re wrong. We know better than
that.’

The white-whiskered one turned suddenly to H. O. and pulled him out of
the hedge.

‘And what does that mean?’ he said, and he was pink with fury to the
ends of his large ears, as he pointed to the card on H. O.’s breast,
which said, ‘Moat House Fox-Hunters’.

Then Oswald said, ‘We WERE playing at fox-hunting, but we couldn’t find
anything but a rabbit that hid, so my brother was being the fox; and
then we found the fox shot dead, and I don’t know who did it; and we
were sorry for it and we buried it--and that’s all.’

‘Not quite,’ said the riding-breeches gentleman, with what I think you
call a bitter smile, ‘not quite. This is my land and I’ll have you up
for trespass and damage. Come along now, no nonsense! I’m a magistrate
and I’m Master of the Hounds. A vixen, too! What did you shoot her
with? You’re too young to have a gun. Sneaked your Father’s revolver, I
suppose?’

Oswald thought it was better to be goldenly silent. But it was vain.
The Master of the Hounds made him empty his pockets, and there was the
pistol and the cartridges.

The magistrate laughed a harsh laugh of successful disagreeableness.

‘All right,’ said he, ‘where’s your licence? You come with me. A week or
two in prison.’

I don’t believe now he could have done it, but we all thought then he
could and would, what’s more.

So H. O. began to cry, but Noel spoke up. His teeth were chattering yet
he spoke up like a man.

He said, ‘You don’t know us. You’ve no right not to believe us till
you’ve found us out in a lie. We don’t tell lies. You ask Albert’s uncle
if we do.’

‘Hold your tongue,’ said the White-Whiskered. But Noel’s blood was up.

‘If you do put us in prison without being sure,’ he said, trembling more
and more, ‘you are a horrible tyrant like Caligula, and Herod, or Nero,
and the Spanish Inquisition, and I will write a poem about it in prison,
and people will curse you for ever.’

‘Upon my word,’ said White Whiskers. ‘We’ll see about that,’ and he
turned up the lane with the fox hanging from one hand and Noel’s ear
once more reposing in the other.

I thought Noel would cry or faint. But he bore up nobly--exactly like an
early Christian martyr.

The rest of us came along too. I carried the spade and Dicky had the
fork. H. O. had the card, and Noel had the magistrate. At the end of
the lane there was Alice. She had bunked home, obeying the orders of her
thoughtful brother, but she had bottled back again like a shot, so as
not to be out of the scrape. She is almost worthy to be a boy for some
things.

She spoke to Mr Magistrate and said--

‘Where are you taking him?’

The outraged majesty of the magistrate said, ‘To prison, you naughty
little girl.’

Alice said, ‘Noel will faint. Somebody once tried to take him to prison
before--about a dog. Do please come to our house and see our uncle--at
least he’s not--but it’s the same thing. We didn’t kill the fox, if
that’s what you think--indeed we didn’t. Oh, dear, I do wish you’d think
of your own little boys and girls if you’ve got any, or else about when
you were little. You wouldn’t be so horrid if you did.’

I don’t know which, if either, of these objects the fox-hound master
thought of, but he said--

‘Well, lead on,’ and he let go Noel’s ear and Alice snuggled up to Noel
and put her arm round him.

It was a frightened procession, whose cheeks were pale with
alarm--except those between white whiskers, and they were red--that
wound in at our gate and into the hall among the old oak furniture, and
black and white marble floor and things.

Dora and Daisy were at the door. The pink petticoat lay on the table,
all stained with the gore of the departed. Dora looked at us all, and
she saw that it was serious. She pulled out the big oak chair and said,
‘Won’t you sit down?’ very kindly to the white-whiskered magistrate.

He grunted, but did as she said.

Then he looked about him in a silence that was not comforting, and so
did we. At last he said--

‘Come, you didn’t try to bolt. Speak the truth, and I’ll say no more.’

We said we had.

Then he laid the fox on the table, spreading out the petticoat under it,
and he took out a knife and the girls hid their faces. Even Oswald did
not care to look. Wounds in battle are all very well, but it’s different
to see a dead fox cut into with a knife.

Next moment the magistrate wiped something on his handkerchief and then
laid it on the table, and put one of my cartridges beside it. It was the
bullet that had killed the fox.

‘Look here!’ he said. And it was too true. The bullets were the same.

A thrill of despair ran through Oswald. He knows now how a hero feels
when he is innocently accused of a crime and the judge is putting on the
black cap, and the evidence is convulsive and all human aid is despaired
of.

‘I can’t help it,’ he said, ‘we didn’t kill it, and that’s all there is
to it.’

The white-whiskered magistrate may have been master of the fox-hounds,
but he was not master of his temper, which is more important, I should
think, than a lot of beastly dogs.

He said several words which Oswald would never repeat, much less in
his own conversing, and besides that he called us ‘obstinate little
beggars’.

Then suddenly Albert’s uncle entered in the midst of a silence freighted
with despairing reflections. The M.F.H. got up and told his tale: it was
mainly lies, or, to be more polite, it was hardly any of it true, though
I supposed he believed it.

‘I am very sorry, sir’ said Albert’s uncle, looking at the bullets.

‘You’ll excuse my asking for the children’s version?’

‘Oh, certainly, sir, certainly,’ fuming, the fox-hound magistrate
replied.

Then Albert’s uncle said, ‘Now Oswald, I know I can trust you to speak
the exact truth.’

So Oswald did.

Then the white-whiskered fox-master laid the bullets before Albert’s
uncle, and I felt this would be a trial to his faith far worse than the
rack or the thumb-screw in the days of the Armada.

And then Denny came in. He looked at the fox on the table.

‘You found it, then?’ he said.

The M.F.H. would have spoken but Albert’s uncle said, ‘One moment,
Denny; you’ve seen this fox before?’

‘Rather,’ said Denny; ‘I--’

But Albert’s uncle said, ‘Take time. Think before you speak and say
the exact truth. No, don’t whisper to Oswald. This boy,’ he said to
the injured fox-master, ‘has been with me since seven this morning. His
tale, whatever it is, will be independent evidence.’

But Denny would not speak, though again and again Albert’s uncle told
him to.

‘I can’t till I’ve asked Oswald something,’ he said at last. White
Whiskers said, ‘That looks bad--eh?’

But Oswald said, ‘Don’t whisper, old chap. Ask me whatever you like, but
speak up.’

So Denny said, ‘I can’t without breaking the secret oath.’

So then Oswald began to see, and he said, ‘Break away for all you’re
worth, it’s all right.’

And Denny said, drawing relief’s deepest breath, ‘Well then, Oswald
and I have got a pistol--shares--and I had it last night. And when I
couldn’t sleep last night because of the toothache I got up and went out
early this morning. And I took the pistol. And I loaded it just for fun.
And down in the wood I heard a whining like a dog, and I went, and there
was the poor fox caught in an iron trap with teeth. And I went to let it
out and it bit me--look, here’s the place--and the pistol went off and
the fox died, and I am so sorry.’

‘But why didn’t you tell the others?’

‘They weren’t awake when I went to the dentist’s.’

‘But why didn’t you tell your uncle if you’ve been with him all the
morning?’

‘It was the oath,’ H. O. said--

     ‘May I be called a beastly sneak
     If this great secret I ever repeat.’

White Whiskers actually grinned.

‘Well,’ he said, ‘I see it was an accident, my boy.’ Then he turned to
us and said--

‘I owe you an apology for doubting your word--all of you. I hope it’s
accepted.’

We said it was all right and he was to never mind.

But all the same we hated him for it. He tried to make up for his
unbelievingness afterwards by asking Albert’s uncle to shoot rabbits;
but we did not really forgive him till the day when he sent the fox’s
brush to Alice, mounted in silver with a note about her plucky conduct
in standing by her brothers.


We got a lecture about not playing with firearms, but no punishment,
because our conduct had not been exactly sinful, Albert’s uncle said,
but merely silly.

The pistol and the cartridges were confiscated.

I hope the house will never be attacked by burglars. When it is,
Albert’s uncle will only have himself to thank if we are rapidly
overpowered, because it will be his fault that we shall have to meet
them totally unarmed, and be their almost unresisting prey.



CHAPTER 10. THE SALE OF ANTIQUITIES

It began one morning at breakfast. It was the fifteenth of August--the
birthday of Napoleon the Great, Oswald Bastable, and another very nice
writer. Oswald was to keep his birthday on the Saturday, so that his
Father could be there. A birthday when there are only many happy returns
is a little like Sunday or Christmas Eve. Oswald had a birthday-card or
two--that was all; but he did not repine, because he knew they always
make it up to you for putting off keeping your birthday, and he looked
forward to Saturday.

Albert’s uncle had a whole stack of letters as usual, and presently he
tossed one over to Dora, and said, ‘What do you say, little lady? Shall
we let them come?’

But Dora, butter-fingered as ever, missed the catch, and Dick and Noel
both had a try for it, so that the letter went into the place where the
bacon had been, and where now only a frozen-looking lake of bacon fat
was slowly hardening, and then somehow it got into the marmalade, and
then H. O. got it, and Dora said--

‘I don’t want the nasty thing now--all grease and stickiness.’ So H. O.
read it aloud--


MAIDSTONE SOCIETY OF ANTIQUITIES AND     FIELD CLUB
          Aug.  14, 1900

‘DEAR SIR,--At a meeting of the--’


H. O. stuck fast here, and the writing was really very bad, like a
spider that has been in the ink-pot crawling in a hurry over the paper
without stopping to rub its feet properly on the mat. So Oswald took
the letter. He is above minding a little marmalade or bacon. He began to
read. It ran thus:

‘It’s not Antiquities, you little silly,’ he said; ‘it’s Antiquaries.’

‘The other’s a very good word,’ said Albert’s uncle, ‘and I never
call names at breakfast myself--it upsets the digestion, my egregious
Oswald.’

‘That’s a name though,’ said Alice, ‘and you got it out of “Stalky”,
too. Go on, Oswald.’

So Oswald went on where he had been interrupted:

‘MAIDSTONE SOCIETY OF “ANTIQUARIES” AND FIELD CLUB

Aug.  14,1900.

‘DEAR SIR,--At a meeting of the Committee of this Society it was agreed
that a field day should be held on Aug. 20, when the Society proposes to
visit the interesting church of Ivybridge and also the Roman remains
in the vicinity. Our president, Mr Longchamps, F.R.S., has obtained
permission to open a barrow in the Three Trees pasture. We venture to
ask whether you would allow the members of the Society to walk through
your grounds and to inspect--from without, of course--your beautiful
house, which is, as you are doubtless aware, of great historic interest,
having been for some years the residence of the celebrated Sir Thomas
Wyatt.--I am, dear Sir, yours faithfully,

‘EDWARD K.  TURNBULL (Hon. Sec.).’


‘Just so,’ said Albert’s uncle; ‘well, shall we permit the eye of the
Maidstone Antiquities to profane these sacred solitudes, and the foot of
the Field Club to kick up a dust on our gravel?’

‘Our gravel is all grass,’ H. O. said.

And the girls said, ‘Oh, do let them come!’ It was Alice who said--

‘Why not ask them to tea? They’ll be very tired coming all the way from
Maidstone.’

‘Would you really like it?’ Albert’s uncle asked. ‘I’m afraid they’ll
be but dull dogs, the Antiquities, stuffy old gentlemen with amphorae
in their buttonholes instead of orchids, and pedigrees poking out of all
their pockets.’

We laughed--because we knew what an amphorae is. If you don’t you might
look it up in the dicker. It’s not a flower, though it sounds like one
out of the gardening book, the kind you never hear of anyone growing.

Dora said she thought it would be splendid.

‘And we could have out the best china,’ she said, ‘and decorate the
table with flowers. We could have tea in the garden. We’ve never had a
party since we’ve been here.’

‘I warn you that your guests may be boresome; however, have it your own
way,’ Albert’s uncle said; and he went off to write the invitation to
tea to the Maidstone Antiquities. I know that is the wrong word but
somehow we all used it whenever we spoke of them, which was often.

In a day or two Albert’s uncle came in to tea with a lightly-clouded
brow.

‘You’ve let me in for a nice thing,’ he said. ‘I asked the Antiquities
to tea, and I asked casually how many we might expect. I thought
we might need at least the full dozen of the best teacups. Now the
secretary writes accepting my kind invitation--’

‘Oh, good!’ we cried. ‘And how many are coming?’ ‘Oh, only about
sixty,’ was the groaning rejoinder. ‘Perhaps more, should the weather be
exceptionally favourable.’

Though stunned at first, we presently decided that we were pleased.

We had never, never given such a big party.

The girls were allowed to help in the kitchen, where Mrs Pettigrew made
cakes all day long without stopping. They did not let us boys be there,
though I cannot see any harm in putting your finger in a cake before
it is baked, and then licking your finger, if you are careful to put
a different finger in the cake next time. Cake before it is baked is
delicious--like a sort of cream.

Albert’s uncle said he was the prey of despair. He drove in to Maidstone
one day. When we asked him where he was going, he said--

‘To get my hair cut: if I keep it this length I shall certainly tear it
out by double handfuls in the extremity of my anguish every time I think
of those innumerable Antiquities.’

But we found out afterwards that he really went to borrow china and
things to give the Antiquities their tea out of; though he did have his
hair cut too, because he is the soul of truth and honour.

Oswald had a very good sort of birthday, with bows and arrows as well as
other presents. I think these were meant to make up for the pistol that
was taken away after the adventure of the fox-hunting. These gave us
boys something to do between the birthday-keeping, which was on the
Saturday, and the Wednesday when the Antiquities were to come.

We did not allow the girls to play with the bows and arrows, because
they had the cakes that we were cut off from: there was little or no
unpleasantness over this.

On the Tuesday we went down to look at the Roman place where the
Antiquities were going to dig. We sat on the Roman wall and ate nuts.
And as we sat there, we saw coming through the beet-field two labourers
with picks and shovels, and a very young man with thin legs and a
bicycle. It turned out afterwards to be a free-wheel, the first we had
ever seen.

They stopped at a mound inside the Roman wall, and the men took their
coats off and spat on their hands.

We went down at once, of course. The thin-legged bicyclist explained his
machine to us very fully and carefully when we asked him, and then we
saw the men were cutting turfs and turning them over and rolling them up
and putting them in a heap. So we asked the gentleman with the thin legs
what they were doing. He said--

‘They are beginning the preliminary excavation in readiness for
to-morrow.’

‘What’s up to-morrow?’ H. O. asked.

‘To-morrow we propose to open this barrow and examine it.’

‘Then YOU’RE the Antiquities?’ said H. O.

‘I’m the secretary,’ said the gentleman, smiling, but narrowly.

‘Oh, you’re all coming to tea with us,’ Dora said, and added anxiously,
‘how many of you do you think there’ll be?’

‘Oh, not more than eighty or ninety, I should think,’ replied the
gentleman.

This took our breath away and we went home. As we went, Oswald,
who notices many things that would pass unobserved by the light and
careless, saw Denny frowning hard. So he said, ‘What’s up?’

‘I’ve got an idea,’ the Dentist said. ‘Let’s call a council.’ The
Dentist had grown quite used to our ways now. We had called him Dentist
ever since the fox-hunt day. He called a council as if he had been used
to calling such things all his life, and having them come, too; whereas
we all know that his former existing was that of a white mouse in a
trap, with that cat of a Murdstone aunt watching him through the bars.

(That is what is called a figure of speech. Albert’s uncle told me.)

Councils are held in the straw-loft. As soon as we were all there, and
the straw had stopped rustling after our sitting down, Dicky said--

‘I hope it’s nothing to do with the Wouldbegoods?’

‘No,’ said Denny in a hurry: ‘quite the opposite.’

‘I hope it’s nothing wrong,’ said Dora and Daisy together.

‘It’s--it’s “Hail to thee, blithe spirit--bird thou never wert”,’ said
Denny. ‘I mean, I think it’s what is called a lark.’

‘You never know your luck. Go on, Dentist,’ said Dicky.

‘Well, then, do you know a book called The Daisy Chain?’

We didn’t.

‘It’s by Miss Charlotte M. Yonge,’ Daisy interrupted, ‘and it’s about
a family of poor motherless children who tried so hard to be good,
and they were confirmed, and had a bazaar, and went to church at the
Minster, and one of them got married and wore black watered silk and
silver ornaments. So her baby died, and then she was sorry she had not
been a good mother to it. And--’ Here Dicky got up and said he’d got
some snares to attend to, and he’d receive a report of the Council after
it was over. But he only got as far as the trap-door, and then Oswald,
the fleet of foot, closed with him, and they rolled together on the
floor, while all the others called out ‘Come back! Come back!’ like
guinea-hens on a fence.

Through the rustle and bustle and hustle of the struggle with Dicky,
Oswald heard the voice of Denny murmuring one of his everlasting
quotations--

    ‘“Come back, come back!” he cried in Greek,
     “Across the stormy water,
     And I’ll forgive your Highland cheek,
     My daughter, O my daughter!”’

When quiet was restored and Dicky had agreed to go through with the
Council, Denny said--

‘The Daisy Chain is not a bit like that really. It’s a ripping book. One
of the boys dresses up like a lady and comes to call, and another tries
to hit his little sister with a hoe. It’s jolly fine, I tell you.’

Denny is learning to say what he thinks, just like other boys. He would
never have learnt such words as ‘ripping’ and ‘jolly fine’ while under
the auntal tyranny.

Since then I have read The Daisy Chain. It is a first-rate book for
girls and little boys.

But we did not want to talk about The Daisy Chain just then, so Oswald
said--

‘But what’s your lark?’ Denny got pale pink and said--

‘Don’t hurry me. I’ll tell you directly. Let me think a minute.’

Then he shut his pale pink eyelids a moment in thought, and then opened
them and stood up on the straw and said very fast--

‘Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears, or if not ears, pots.
You know Albert’s uncle said they were going to open the barrow, to
look for Roman remains to-morrow. Don’t you think it seems a pity they
shouldn’t find any?’

‘Perhaps they will,’ Dora said.

But Oswald saw, and he said ‘Primus! Go ahead, old man.’

The Dentist went ahead.

‘In The Daisy Chain,’ he said, ‘they dug in a Roman encampment and the
children went first and put some pottery there they’d made themselves,
and Harry’s old medal of the Duke of Wellington. The doctor helped them
to some stuff to partly efface the inscription, and all the grown-ups
were sold. I thought we might--

     ‘You may break, you may shatter
     The vase if you will;
     But the scent of the Romans
     Will cling round it still.’

Denny sat down amid applause. It really was a great idea, at least for
HIM. It seemed to add just what was wanted to the visit of the Maidstone
Antiquities. To sell the Antiquities thoroughly would be indeed
splendiferous. Of course Dora made haste to point out that we had not
got an old medal of the Duke of Wellington, and that we hadn’t any
doctor who would ‘help us to stuff to efface’, and etcetera; but we
sternly bade her stow it. We weren’t going to do EXACTLY like those
Daisy Chain kids.

The pottery was easy. We had made a lot of it by the stream--which was
the Nile when we discovered its source--and dried it in the sun, and
then baked it under a bonfire, like in Foul Play. And most of the
things were such queer shapes that they should have done for almost
anything--Roman or Greek, or even Egyptian or antediluvian, or
household milk-jugs of the cavemen, Albert’s uncle said. The pots were,
fortunately, quite ready and dirty, because we had already buried them
in mixed sand and river mud to improve the colour, and not remembered to
wash it off.

So the Council at once collected it all--and some rusty hinges and some
brass buttons and a file without a handle; and the girl Councillors
carried it all concealed in their pinafores, while the men members
carried digging tools. H. O. and Daisy were sent on ahead as scouts
to see if the coast was clear. We have learned the true usefulness of
scouts from reading about the Transvaal War. But all was still in the
hush of evening sunset on the Roman ruin.

We posted sentries, who were to lie on their stomachs on the walls and
give a long, low, signifying whistle if aught approached.

Then we dug a tunnel, like the one we once did after treasure, when we
happened to bury a boy. It took some time; but never shall it be said
that a Bastable grudged time or trouble when a lark was at stake. We put
the things in as naturally as we could, and shoved the dirt back, till
everything looked just as before. Then we went home, late for tea.
But it was in a good cause; and there was no hot toast, only
bread-and-butter, which does not get cold with waiting.

That night Alice whispered to Oswald on the stairs, as we went up to
bed--

‘Meet me outside your door when the others are asleep. Hist! Not a
word.’

Oswald said, ‘No kid?’ And she replied in the affirmation.

So he kept awake by biting his tongue and pulling his hair--for he
shrinks from no pain if it is needful and right.

And when the others all slept the sleep of innocent youth, he got up and
went out, and there was Alice dressed.

She said, ‘I’ve found some broken things that look ever so much more
Roman--they were on top of the cupboard in the library. If you’ll come
with me, we’ll bury them just to see how surprised the others will be.’

It was a wild and daring act, but Oswald did not mind.

He said--

‘Wait half a shake.’ And he put on his knickerbockers and jacket, and
slipped a few peppermints into his pocket in case of catching cold.
It is these thoughtful expedients which mark the born explorer and
adventurer.

It was a little cold; but the white moonlight was very fair to see, and
we decided we’d do some other daring moonlight act some other day. We
got out of the front door, which is never locked till Albert’s uncle
goes to bed at twelve or one, and we ran swiftly and silently across the
bridge and through the fields to the Roman ruin.

Alice told me afterwards she should have been afraid if it had been
dark. But the moonlight made it as bright as day is in your dreams.

Oswald had taken the spade and a sheet of newspaper.

We did not take all the pots Alice had found--but just the two that
weren’t broken--two crooked jugs, made of stuff like flower-pots are
made of. We made two long cuts with the spade and lifted the turf up and
scratched the earth under, and took it out very carefully in handfuls
on to the newspaper, till the hole was deepish. Then we put in the jugs,
and filled it up with earth and flattened the turf over. Turf stretches
like elastic. This we did a couple of yards from the place where the
mound was dug into by the men, and we had been so careful with the
newspaper that there was no loose earth about.

Then we went home in the wet moonlight--at least the grass was very
wet--chuckling through the peppermint, and got up to bed without anyone
knowing a single thing about it.


The next day the Antiquities came. It was a jolly hot day, and the
tables were spread under the trees on the lawn, like a large and very
grand Sunday-school treat. There were dozens of different kinds of cake,
and bread-and-butter, both white and brown, and gooseberries and
plums and jam sandwiches. And the girls decorated the tables with
flowers--blue larkspur and white Canterbury bells. And at about three
there was a noise of people walking in the road, and presently the
Antiquities began to come in at the front gate, and stood about on the
lawn by twos and threes and sixes and sevens, looking shy and uncomfy,
exactly like a Sunday-school treat. Presently some gentlemen came, who
looked like the teachers; they were not shy, and they came right up to
the door. So Albert’s uncle, who had not been too proud to be up in our
room with us watching the people on the lawn through the netting of our
short blinds, said--

‘I suppose that’s the Committee. Come on!’

So we all went down--we were in our Sunday things--and Albert’s uncle
received the Committee like a feudal system baron, and we were his
retainers.

He talked about dates, and king posts and gables, and mullions, and
foundations, and records, and Sir Thomas Wyatt, and poetry, and Julius
Caesar, and Roman remains, and lych gates and churches, and dog’s-tooth
moulding till the brain of Oswald reeled. I suppose that Albert’s uncle
remarked that all our mouths were open, which is a sign of reels in the
brain, for he whispered--

‘Go hence, and mingle unsuspected with the crowd!’

So we went out on to the lawn, which was now crowded with men and women
and one child. This was a girl; she was fat, and we tried to talk to
her, though we did not like her. (She was covered in red velvet like
an arm-chair.) But she wouldn’t. We thought at first she was from a
deaf-and-dumb asylum, where her kind teachers had only managed to teach
the afflicted to say ‘Yes’ and ‘No’. But afterwards we knew better, for
Noel heard her say to her mother, ‘I wish you hadn’t brought me, mamma.
I didn’t have a pretty teacup, and I haven’t enjoyed my tea one bit.’
And she had had five pieces of cake, besides little cakes and nearly
a whole plate of plums, and there were only twelve pretty teacups
altogether.

Several grown-ups talked to us in a most uninterested way, and then
the President read a paper about the Moat House, which we couldn’t
understand, and other people made speeches we couldn’t understand
either, except the part about kind hospitality, which made us not know
where to look.

Then Dora and Alice and Daisy and Mrs Pettigrew poured out the tea, and
we handed cups and plates.

Albert’s uncle took me behind a bush to see him tear what was left
of his hair when he found there were one hundred and twenty-three
Antiquities present, and I heard the President say to the Secretary that
‘tea always fetched them’.

Then it was time for the Roman ruin, and our hearts beat high as we took
our hats--it was exactly like Sunday--and joined the crowded procession
of eager Antiquities. Many of them had umbrellas and overcoats, though
the weather was fiery and without a cloud. That is the sort of people
they were. The ladies all wore stiff bonnets, and no one took their
gloves off, though, of course, it was quite in the country, and it is
not wrong to take your gloves off there.

We had planned to be quite close when the digging went on; but Albert’s
uncle made us a mystic sign and drew us apart.

Then he said: ‘The stalls and dress circle are for the guests. The hosts
and hostesses retire to the gallery, whence, I am credibly informed, an
excellent view may be obtained.’

So we all went up on the Roman walls, and thus missed the cream of the
lark; for we could not exactly see what was happening. But we saw that
things were being taken from the ground as the men dug, and passed
round for the Antiquities to look at. And we knew they must be our Roman
remains; but the Antiquities did not seem to care for them much, though
we heard sounds of pleased laughter. And at last Alice and I exchanged
meaning glances when the spot was reached where we had put in the
extras. Then the crowd closed up thick, and we heard excited talk and we
knew we really HAD sold the Antiquities this time.

Presently the bonnets and coats began to spread out and trickle towards
the house and we were aware that all would soon be over. So we cut home
the back way, just in time to hear the President saying to Albert’s
uncle--

‘A genuine find--most interesting. Oh, really, you ought to have ONE.
Well, if you insist--’

And so, by slow and dull degrees, the thick sprinkling of Antiquities
melted off the lawn; the party was over, and only the dirty teacups and
plates, and the trampled grass and the pleasures of memory were left.

We had a very beautiful supper--out of doors, too--with jam sandwiches
and cakes and things that were over; and as we watched the setting
monarch of the skies--I mean the sun--Alice said--

‘Let’s tell.’

We let the Dentist tell, because it was he who hatched the lark, but we
helped him a little in the narrating of the fell plot, because he has
yet to learn how to tell a story straight from the beginning.

When he had done, and we had done, Albert’s uncle said, ‘Well, it
amused you; and you’ll be glad to learn that it amused your friends the
Antiquities.’

‘Didn’t they think they were Roman?’ Daisy said; ‘they did in The Daisy
Chain.’

‘Not in the least,’ said Albert’s uncle; ‘but the Treasurer and
Secretary were charmed by your ingenious preparations for their
reception.’

‘We didn’t want them to be disappointed,’ said Dora.

‘They weren’t,’ said Albert’s uncle. ‘Steady on with those plums, H.O. A
little way beyond the treasure you had prepared for them they found two
specimens of REAL Roman pottery which sent every man-jack of them home
thanking his stars he had been born a happy little Antiquary child.’

‘Those were our jugs,’ said Alice, ‘and we really HAVE sold the
Antiquities. She unfolded the tale about our getting the jugs and
burying them in the moonlight, and the mound; and the others listened
with deeply respectful interest. ‘We really have done it this time,
haven’t we?’ she added in tones of well-deserved triumph.

But Oswald had noticed a queer look about Albert’s uncle from almost the
beginning of Alice’s recital; and he now had the sensation of something
being up, which has on other occasions frozen his noble blood. The
silence of Albert’s uncle now froze it yet more Arcticly.

‘Haven’t we?’ repeated Alice, unconscious of what her sensitive
brother’s delicate feelings had already got hold of. ‘We have done it
this time, haven’t we?’

‘Since you ask me thus pointedly,’ answered Albert’s uncle at last, ‘I
cannot but confess that I think you have indeed done it. Those pots on
the top of the library cupboard ARE Roman pottery. The amphorae
which you hid in the mound are probably--I can’t say for certain,
mind--priceless. They are the property of the owner of this house. You
have taken them out and buried them. The President of the Maidstone
Antiquarian Society has taken them away in his bag. Now what are you
going to do?’

Alice and I did not know what to say, or where to look. The others added
to our pained position by some ungenerous murmurs about our not being so
jolly clever as we thought ourselves.

There was a very far from pleasing silence. Then Oswald got up. He
said--

‘Alice, come here a sec; I want to speak to you.’

As Albert’s uncle had offered no advice, Oswald disdained to ask him for
any.

Alice got up too, and she and Oswald went into the garden, and sat down
on the bench under the quince tree, and wished they had never tried to
have a private lark of their very own with the Antiquities--‘A Private
Sale’, Albert’s uncle called it afterwards. But regrets, as nearly
always happens, were vain. Something had to be done.

But what?

Oswald and Alice sat in silent desperateness, and the voices of the
gay and careless others came to them from the lawn, where, heartless
in their youngness, they were playing tag. I don’t know how they could.
Oswald would not like to play tag when his brother and sister were in a
hole, but Oswald is an exception to some boys.

But Dicky told me afterwards he thought it was only a joke of Albert’s
uncle’s.

The dusk grew dusker, till you could hardly tell the quinces from the
leaves, and Alice and Oswald still sat exhausted with hard thinking, but
they could not think of anything. And it grew so dark that the moonlight
began to show.

Then Alice jumped up--just as Oswald was opening his mouth to say
the same thing--and said, ‘Of course--how silly! I know. Come on in,
Oswald.’ And they went on in.

Oswald was still far too proud to consult anyone else. But he just asked
carelessly if Alice and he might go into Maidstone the next day to
buy some wire-netting for a rabbit-hutch, and to see after one or two
things.

Albert’s uncle said certainly. And they went by train with the bailiff
from the farm, who was going in about some sheep-dip and to buy pigs.
At any other time Oswald would not have been able to bear to leave the
bailiff without seeing the pigs bought. But now it was different. For he
and Alice had the weight on their bosoms of being thieves without having
meant it--and nothing, not even pigs, had power to charm the young but
honourable Oswald till that stain had been wiped away.

So he took Alice to the Secretary of the Maidstone Antiquities’ house,
and Mr Turnbull was out, but the maid-servant kindly told us where the
President lived, and ere long the trembling feet of the unfortunate
brother and sister vibrated on the spotless gravel of Camperdown Villa.

When they asked, they were told that Mr Longchamps was at home. Then
they waited, paralysed with undescribed emotions, in a large room with
books and swords and glass bookcases with rotten-looking odds and ends
in them. Mr Longchamps was a collector. That means he stuck to anything,
no matter how ugly and silly, if only it was old.

He came in rubbing his hands, and very kind. He remembered us very well,
he said, and asked what he could do for us.

Oswald for once was dumb. He could not find words in which to own
himself the ass he had been. But Alice was less delicately moulded. She
said--

‘Oh, if you please, we are most awfully sorry, and we hope you’ll
forgive us, but we thought it would be such a pity for you and all the
other poor dear Antiquities to come all that way and then find nothing
Roman--so we put some pots and things in the barrow for you to find.’

‘So I perceived,’ said the President, stroking his white beard and
smiling most agreeably at us; ‘a harmless joke, my dear! Youth’s the
season for jesting. There’s no harm done--pray think no more about it.
It’s very honourable of you to come and apologize, I’m sure.’

His brow began to wear the furrowed, anxious look of one who would
fain be rid of his guests and get back to what he was doing before they
interrupted him.

Alice said, ‘We didn’t come for that. It’s MUCH worse. Those were two
REAL true Roman jugs you took away; we put them there; they aren’t
ours. We didn’t know they were real Roman. We wanted to sell the
Antiquities--I mean Antiquaries--and we were sold ourselves.’

‘This is serious,’ said the gentleman. ‘I suppose you’d know the--the
“jugs” if you saw them again?’

‘Anywhere,’ said Oswald, with the confidential rashness of one who does
not know what he is talking about.

Mr Longchamps opened the door of a little room leading out of the one we
were in, and beckoned us to follow. We found ourselves amid shelves and
shelves of pottery of all sorts; and two whole shelves--small ones--were
filled with the sort of jug we wanted.

‘Well,’ said the President, with a veiled menacing sort of smile, like a
wicked cardinal, ‘which is it?’

Oswald said, ‘I don’t know.’

Alice said, ‘I should know if I had it in my hand.’

The President patiently took the jugs down one after another, and Alice
tried to look inside them. And one after another she shook her head and
gave them back. At last she said, ‘You didn’t WASH them?’

Mr Longchamps shuddered and said ‘No’.

‘Then,’ said Alice, ‘there is something written with lead-pencil inside
both the jugs. I wish I hadn’t. I would rather you didn’t read it. I
didn’t know it would be a nice old gentleman like you would find it.
I thought it would be the younger gentleman with the thin legs and the
narrow smile.’

‘Mr Turnbull.’ The President seemed to recognize the description
unerringly. ‘Well, well--boys will be boys--girls, I mean. I won’t be
angry. Look at all the “jugs” and see if you can find yours.’

Alice did--and the next one she looked at she said, ‘This is one’--and
two jugs further on she said, ‘This is the other.’

‘Well,’ the President said, ‘these are certainly the specimens which I
obtained yesterday. If your uncle will call on me I will return them
to him. But it’s a disappointment. Yes, I think you must let me look
inside.’

He did. And at the first one he said nothing. At the second he laughed.

‘Well, well,’ he said, ‘we can’t expect old heads on young shoulders.
You’re not the first who went forth to shear and returned shorn. Nor, it
appears, am I. Next time you have a Sale of Antiquities, take care that
you yourself are not “sold”. Good-day to you, my dear. Don’t let the
incident prey on your mind,’ he said to Alice. ‘Bless your heart, I was
a boy once myself, unlikely as you may think it. Good-bye.’

We were in time to see the pigs bought after all.

I asked Alice what on earth it was she’d scribbled inside the beastly
jugs, and she owned that just to make the lark complete she had written
‘Sucks’ in one of the jugs, and ‘Sold again, silly’, in the other.

But we know well enough who it was that was sold. And if ever we have
any Antiquities to tea again, they shan’t find so much as a Greek
waistcoat button if we can help it.

Unless it’s the President, for he did not behave at all badly. For a
man of his age I think he behaved exceedingly well. Oswald can picture
a very different scene having been enacted over those rotten pots if the
President had been an otherwise sort of man.

But that picture is not pleasing, so Oswald will not distress you by
drawing it for you. You can most likely do it easily for yourself.



CHAPTER 11. THE BENEVOLENT BAR

The tramp was very dusty about the feet and legs, and his clothes were
very ragged and dirty, but he had cheerful twinkly grey eyes, and he
touched his cap to the girls when he spoke to us, though a little as
though he would rather not.

We were on the top of the big wall of the Roman ruin in the Three Tree
pasture. We had just concluded a severe siege with bows and arrows--the
ones that were given us to make up for the pistol that was confiscated
after the sad but not sinful occasion when it shot a fox.

To avoid accidents that you would be sorry for afterwards, Oswald, in
his thoughtfulness, had decreed that everyone was to wear wire masks.

Luckily there were plenty of these, because a man who lived in the Moat
House once went to Rome, where they throw hundreds and thousands at
each other in play, and call it a Comfit Battle or Battaglia di Confetti
(that’s real Italian). And he wanted to get up that sort of thing among
the village people--but they were too beastly slack, so he chucked it.

And in the attic were the wire masks he brought home with him from Rome,
which people wear to prevent the nasty comfits getting in their mouths
and eyes.

So we were all armed to the teeth with masks and arrows, but in
attacking or defending a fort your real strength is not in your
equipment, but in your power of Shove. Oswald, Alice, Noel and Denny
defended the fort. We were much the strongest side, but that was how
Dicky and Oswald picked up.

The others got in, it is true, but that was only because an arrow hit
Dicky on the nose, and it bled quarts as usual, though hit only
through the wire mask. Then he put into dock for repairs, and while the
defending party weren’t looking he sneaked up the wall at the back and
shoved Oswald off, and fell on top of him, so that the fort, now that
it had lost its gallant young leader, the life and soul of the besieged
party, was of course soon overpowered, and had to surrender.

Then we sat on the top and ate some peppermints Albert’s uncle brought
us a bag of from Maidstone when he went to fetch away the Roman pottery
we tried to sell the Antiquities with.

The battle was over, and peace raged among us as we sat in the sun on
the big wall and looked at the fields, all blue and swimming in the
heat.

We saw the tramp coming through the beetfield. He made a dusty blot on
the fair scene.

When he saw us he came close to the wall, and touched his cap, as I have
said, and remarked--

‘Excuse me interrupting of your sports, young gentlemen and ladies, but
if you could so far oblige as to tell a labouring man the way to the
nearest pub. It’s a dry day and no error.’

‘The “Rose and Crown” is the best pub,’ said Dicky, ‘and the landlady is
a friend of ours. It’s about a mile if you go by the field path.’

‘Lor’ love a duck!’ said the tramp, ‘a mile’s a long way, and walking’s
a dry job this ‘ere weather.’ We said we agreed with him.

‘Upon my sacred,’ said the tramp, ‘if there was a pump handy I believe
I’d take a turn at it--I would indeed, so help me if I wouldn’t! Though
water always upsets me and makes my ‘and shaky.’

We had not cared much about tramps since the adventure of the villainous
sailor-man and the Tower of Mystery, but we had the dogs on the wall
with us (Lady was awfully difficult to get up, on account of her long
deer-hound legs), and the position was a strong one, and easy to defend.
Besides the tramp did not look like that bad sailor, nor talk like it.
And we considerably outnumbered the tramp, anyway.

Alice nudged Oswald and said something about Sir Philip Sidney and the
tramp’s need being greater than his, so Oswald was obliged to go to the
hole in the top of the wall where we store provisions during sieges and
get out the bottle of ginger-beer which he had gone without when
the others had theirs so as to drink it when he got really thirsty.
Meanwhile Alice said--

‘We’ve got some ginger-beer; my brother’s getting it. I hope you won’t
mind drinking out of our glass. We can’t wash it, you know--unless we
rinse it out with a little ginger-beer.’

‘Don’t ye do it, miss,’ he said eagerly; ‘never waste good liquor on
washing.’

The glass was beside us on the wall. Oswald filled it with ginger-beer
and handed down the foaming tankard to the tramp. He had to lie on his
young stomach to do this.

The tramp was really quite polite--one of Nature’s gentlemen, and a man
as well, we found out afterwards. He said--

‘Here’s to you!’ before he drank. Then he drained the glass till the rim
rested on his nose.

‘Swelp me, but I WAS dry,’ he said. ‘Don’t seem to matter much what
it is, this weather, do it?--so long as it’s suthink wet. Well, here’s
thanking you.’

‘You’re very welcome,’ said Dora; ‘I’m glad you liked it.’

‘Like it?’--said he. ‘I don’t suppose you know what it’s like to have a
thirst on you. Talk of free schools and free libraries, and free baths
and wash-houses and such! Why don’t someone start free DRINKS? He’d be a
‘ero, he would. I’d vote for him any day of the week and one over. Ef yer
don’t objec I’ll set down a bit and put on a pipe.’

He sat down on the grass and began to smoke. We asked him questions
about himself, and he told us many of his secret sorrows--especially
about there being no work nowadays for an honest man. At last he dropped
asleep in the middle of a story about a vestry he worked for that hadn’t
acted fair and square by him like he had by them, or it (I don’t know if
vestry is singular or plural), and we went home. But before we went we
held a hurried council and collected what money we could from the little
we had with us (it was ninepence-halfpenny), and wrapped it in an old
envelope Dicky had in his pocket and put it gently on the billowing
middle of the poor tramp’s sleeping waistcoat, so that he would find
it when he woke. None of the dogs said a single syllable while we were
doing this, so we knew they believed him to be poor but honest, and we
always find it safe to take their word for things like that.

As we went home a brooding silence fell upon us; we found out afterwards
that those words of the poor tramp’s about free drinks had sunk deep in
all our hearts, and rankled there.

After dinner we went out and sat with our feet in the stream. People
tell you it makes your grub disagree with you to do this just after
meals, but it never hurts us. There is a fallen willow across the stream
that just seats the eight of us, only the ones at the end can’t get
their feet into the water properly because of the bushes, so we keep
changing places. We had got some liquorice root to chew. This helps
thought. Dora broke a peaceful silence with this speech--

‘Free drinks.’

The words awoke a response in every breast.

‘I wonder someone doesn’t,’ H. O. said, leaning back till he nearly
toppled in, and was only saved by Oswald and Alice at their own deadly
peril.

‘Do for goodness sake sit still, H. O.,’ observed Alice. ‘It would be a
glorious act! I wish WE could.’

‘What, sit still?’ asked H. O.

‘No, my child,’ replied Oswald, ‘most of us can do that when we try.
Your angel sister was only wishing to set up free drinks for the poor
and thirsty.’

‘Not for all of them,’ Alice said, ‘just a few. Change places now,
Dicky. My feet aren’t properly wet at all.’

It is very difficult to change places safely on the willow. The changers
have to crawl over the laps of the others, while the rest sit tight and
hold on for all they’re worth. But the hard task was accomplished and
then Alice went on--

‘And we couldn’t do it for always, only a day or two--just while our
money held out. Eiffel Tower lemonade’s the best, and you get a jolly
lot of it for your money too. There must be a great many sincerely
thirsty persons go along the Dover Road every day.’

‘It wouldn’t be bad. We’ve got a little chink between us,’ said Oswald.

‘And then think how the poor grateful creatures would linger and tell us
about their inmost sorrows. It would be most frightfully interesting.
We could write all their agonied life histories down afterwards like All
the Year Round Christmas numbers. Oh, do let’s!’

Alice was wriggling so with earnestness that Dicky thumped her to make
her calm.

‘We might do it, just for one day,’ Oswald said, ‘but it wouldn’t be
much--only a drop in the ocean compared with the enormous dryness of all
the people in the whole world. Still, every little helps, as the mermaid
said when she cried into the sea.’

‘I know a piece of poetry about that,’ Denny said.


          ‘Small things are best.
          Care and unrest
          To wealth and rank are given,
          But little things
          On little wings--

do something or other, I forget what, but it means the same as Oswald
was saying about the mermaid.’

‘What are you going to call it?’ asked Noel, coming out of a dream.

‘Call what?’

‘The Free Drinks game.’

          ‘It’s a horrid shame
          If the Free Drinks game
          Doesn’t have a name.
          You would be to blame
          If anyone came
          And--’

‘Oh, shut up!’ remarked Dicky. ‘You’ve been making that rot up all the
time we’ve been talking instead of listening properly.’ Dicky hates
poetry. I don’t mind it so very much myself, especially Macaulay’s and
Kipling’s and Noel’s.

‘There was a lot more--“lame” and “dame” and “name” and “game” and
things--and now I’ve forgotten it,’ Noel said in gloom.

‘Never mind,’ Alice answered, ‘it’ll come back to you in the silent
watches of the night; you see if it doesn’t. But really, Noel’s right,
it OUGHT to have a name.’

‘Free Drinks Company.’ ‘Thirsty Travellers’ Rest.’ ‘The Travellers’
Joy.’

These names were suggested, but not cared for extra.

Then someone said--I think it was Oswald--‘Why not “The House
Beautiful”?’

‘It can’t be a house, it must be in the road. It’ll only be a stall.’

‘The “Stall Beautiful” is simply silly,’ Oswald said.

‘The “Bar Beautiful” then,’ said Dicky, who knows what the ‘Rose and
Crown’ bar is like inside, which of course is hidden from girls.

‘Oh, wait a minute,’ cried the Dentist, snapping his fingers like
he always does when he is trying to remember things. ‘I thought of
something, only Daisy tickled me and it’s gone--I know--let’s call it
the Benevolent Bar!’

It was exactly right, and told the whole truth in two words.
‘Benevolent’ showed it was free and ‘Bar’ showed what was free; e.g.
things to drink. The ‘Benevolent Bar’ it was.

We went home at once to prepare for the morrow, for of course we meant
to do it the very next day. Procrastination is you know what--and delays
are dangerous. If we had waited long we might have happened to spend our
money on something else.

The utmost secrecy had to be observed, because Mrs Pettigrew hates
tramps. Most people do who keep fowls. Albert’s uncle was in London till
the next evening, so we could not consult him, but we know he is always
chock full of intelligent sympathy with the poor and needy.

Acting with the deepest disguise, we made an awning to cover the
Benevolent Bar keepers from the searching rays of the monarch of the
skies. We found some old striped sun-blinds in the attic, and the girls
sewed them together. They were not very big when they were done, so we
added the girls’ striped petticoats. I am sorry their petticoats turn
up so constantly in my narrative, but they really are very useful,
especially when the band is cut off. The girls borrowed Mrs Pettigrew’s
sewing-machine; they could not ask her leave without explanations, which
we did not wish to give just then, and she had lent it to them before.
They took it into the cellar to work it, so that she should not hear the
noise and ask bothering questions.

They had to balance it on one end of the beer-stand. It was not easy.
While they were doing the sewing we boys went out and got willow poles
and chopped the twigs off, and got ready as well as we could to put up
the awning.

When we returned a detachment of us went down to the shop in the village
for Eiffel Tower lemonade. We bought seven-and-sixpence worth; then we
made a great label to say what the bar was for. Then there was nothing
else to do except to make rosettes out of a blue sash of Daisy’s to show
we belonged to the Benevolent Bar.

The next day was as hot as ever. We rose early from our innocent
slumbers, and went out to the Dover Road to the spot we had marked down
the day before. It was at a cross-roads, so as to be able to give drinks
to as many people as possible.

We hid the awning and poles behind the hedge and went home to brekker.

After brek we got the big zinc bath they wash clothes in, and after
filling it with clean water we just had to empty it again because it was
too heavy to lift. So we carried it vacant to the trysting-spot and left
H. O. and Noel to guard it while we went and fetched separate pails of
water; very heavy work, and no one who wasn’t really benevolent would
have bothered about it for an instant. Oswald alone carried three pails.
So did Dicky and the Dentist. Then we rolled down some empty barrels
and stood up three of them by the roadside, and put planks on them.
This made a very first-class table, and we covered it with the best
tablecloth we could find in the linen cupboard. We brought out several
glasses and some teacups--not the best ones, Oswald was firm about
that--and the kettle and spirit-lamp and the tea-pot, in case any weary
tramp-woman fancied a cup of tea instead of Eiffel Tower. H. O. and Noel
had to go down to the shop for tea; they need not have grumbled; they
had not carried any of the water. And their having to go the second time
was only because we forgot to tell them to get some real lemons to put
on the bar to show what the drink would be like when you got it. The man
at the shop kindly gave us tick for the lemons, and we cashed up out of
our next week’s pocket-money.

Two or three people passed while we were getting things ready, but
no one said anything except the man who said, ‘Bloomin’ Sunday-school
treat’, and as it was too early in the day for anyone to be thirsty we
did not stop the wayfarers to tell them their thirst could be slaked
without cost at our Benevolent Bar.

But when everything was quite ready, and our blue rosettes fastened on
our breasts over our benevolent hearts, we stuck up the great placard we
had made with ‘Benevolent Bar. Free Drinks to all Weary Travellers’, in
white wadding on red calico, like Christmas decorations in church. We
had meant to fasten this to the edge of the awning, but we had to pin
it to the front of the tablecloth, because I am sorry to say the awning
went wrong from the first. We could not drive the willow poles into the
road; it was much too hard. And in the ditch it was too soft, besides
being no use. So we had just to cover our benevolent heads with our
hats, and take it in turns to go into the shadow of the tree on the
other side of the road. For we had pitched our table on the sunny side
of the way, of course, relying on our broken-reed-like awning, and
wishing to give it a fair chance.

Everything looked very nice, and we longed to see somebody really
miserable come along so as to be able to allieve their distress.

A man and woman were the first: they stopped and stared, but when Alice
said, ‘Free drinks! Free drinks! Aren’t you thirsty?’ they said, ‘No
thank you,’ and went on. Then came a person from the village--he didn’t
even say ‘Thank you’ when we asked him, and Oswald began to fear it
might be like the awful time when we wandered about on Christmas Day
trying to find poor persons and persuade them to eat our Conscience
pudding.

But a man in a blue jersey and a red bundle eased Oswald’s fears by
being willing to drink a glass of lemonade, and even to say, ‘Thank you,
I’m sure’ quite nicely.

After that it was better. As we had foreseen, there were plenty of
thirsty people walking along the Dover Road, and even some from the
cross-road.

We had had the pleasure of seeing nineteen tumblers drained to the dregs
ere we tasted any ourselves. Nobody asked for tea.

More people went by than we gave lemonade to. Some wouldn’t have it
because they were too grand. One man told us he could pay for his own
liquor when he was dry, which, praise be, he wasn’t over and above, at
present; and others asked if we hadn’t any beer, and when we said ‘No’,
they said it showed what sort we were--as if the sort was not a good
one, which it is.

And another man said, ‘Slops again! You never get nothing for nothing,
not this side of heaven you don’t. Look at the bloomin’ blue ribbon on
‘em! Oh, Lor’!’ and went on quite sadly without having a drink.

Our Pig-man who helped us on the Tower of Mystery day went by and we
hailed him, and explained it all to him and gave him a drink, and asked
him to call as he came back. He liked it all, and said we were a real
good sort. How different from the man who wanted the beer. Then he went
on.

One thing I didn’t like, and that was the way boys began to gather. Of
course we could not refuse to give drinks to any traveller who was old
enough to ask for it, but when one boy had had three glasses of lemonade
and asked for another, Oswald said--

‘I think you’ve had jolly well enough. You can’t be really thirsty after
all that lot.’

The boy said, ‘Oh, can’t I? You’ll just see if I can’t,’ and went away.
Presently he came back with four other boys, all bigger than Oswald; and
they all asked for lemonade. Oswald gave it to the four new ones, but he
was determined in his behaviour to the other one, and wouldn’t give him
a drop. Then the five of them went and sat on a gate a little way off
and kept laughing in a nasty way, and whenever a boy went by they called
out--

‘I say, ‘ere’s a go,’ and as often as not the new boy would hang about
with them. It was disquieting, for though they had nearly all had
lemonade we could see it had not made them friendly.

A great glorious glow of goodness gladdened (those go all together and
are called alliteration) our hearts when we saw our own tramp coming
down the road. The dogs did not growl at him as they had at the boys or
the beer-man. (I did not say before that we had the dogs with us, but
of course we had, because we had promised never to go out without them.)
Oswald said, ‘Hullo,’ and the tramp said, ‘Hullo.’ Then Alice said, ‘You
see we’ve taken your advice; we’re giving free drinks. Doesn’t it all
look nice?’

‘It does that,’ said the tramp. ‘I don’t mind if I do.’

So we gave him two glasses of lemonade succeedingly, and thanked him
for giving us the idea. He said we were very welcome, and if we’d no
objection he’d sit down a bit and put on a pipe. He did, and after
talking a little more he fell asleep. Drinking anything seemed to end in
sleep with him. I always thought it was only beer and things made people
sleepy, but he was not so. When he was asleep he rolled into the ditch,
but it did not wake him up.

The boys were getting very noisy, and they began to shout things, and to
make silly noises with their mouths, and when Oswald and Dicky went over
to them and told them to just chuck it, they were worse than ever.
I think perhaps Oswald and Dicky might have fought and settled
them--though there were eleven, yet back to back you can always do it
against overwhelming numbers in a book--only Alice called out--

‘Oswald, here’s some more, come back!’

We went. Three big men were coming down the road, very red and hot, and
not amiable-looking. They stopped in front of the Benevolent Bar and
slowly read the wadding and red-stuff label.

Then one of them said he was blessed, or something like that, and
another said he was too. The third one said, ‘Blessed or not, a drink’s
a drink. Blue ribbon, though, by ----’ (a word you ought not to say,
though it is in the Bible and the catechism as well). ‘Let’s have a
liquor, little missy.’

The dogs were growling, but Oswald thought it best not to take any
notice of what the dogs said, but to give these men each a drink. So he
did. They drank, but not as if they cared about it very much, and then
they set their glasses down on the table, a liberty no one else had
entered into, and began to try and chaff Oswald. Oswald said in an
undervoice to H. O.--

‘Just take charge. I want to speak to the girls a sec. Call if you want
anything.’ And then he drew the others away, to say he thought there’d
been enough of it, and considering the boys and new three men, perhaps
we’d better chuck it and go home. We’d been benevolent nearly four hours
anyway.

While this conversation and the objections of the others were going on,
H. O. perpetuated an act which nearly wrecked the Benevolent Bar.

Of course Oswald was not an eye or ear witness of what happened, but
from what H. O. said in the calmer moments of later life, I think this
was about what happened. One of the big disagreeable men said to H. O.--

‘Ain’t got such a thing as a drop o’ spirit, ‘ave yer?’

H. O. said no, we hadn’t, only lemonade and tea.

‘Lemonade and tea! blank’ (bad word I told you about) ‘and blazes,’
replied the bad character, for such he afterwards proved to be. ‘What’s
THAT then?’

He pointed to a bottle labelled Dewar’s whisky, which stood on the table
near the spirit-kettle.

‘Oh, is THAT what you want?’ said H. O. kindly.

The man is understood to have said he should bloomin’ well think so, but
H. O. is not sure about the ‘bloomin’.

He held out his glass with about half the lemonade in it, and H. O.
generously filled up the tumbler out of the bottle, labelled Dewar’s
whisky. The man took a great drink, and then suddenly he spat out what
happened to be left in his mouth just then, and began to swear. It was
then that Oswald and Dicky rushed upon the scene.

The man was shaking his fist in H. O.’s face, and H. O. was still
holding on to the bottle we had brought out the methylated spirit in for
the lamp, in case of anyone wanting tea, which they hadn’t. ‘If I was
Jim,’ said the second ruffian, for such indeed they were, when he had
snatched the bottle from H. O. and smelt it, ‘I’d chuck the whole show
over the hedge, so I would, and you young gutter-snipes after it, so I
wouldn’t.’

Oswald saw in a moment that in point of strength, if not numbers, he and
his party were out-matched, and the unfriendly boys were drawing gladly
near. It is no shame to signal for help when in distress--the best ships
do it every day. Oswald shouted ‘Help, help!’ Before the words were out
of his brave yet trembling lips our own tramp leapt like an antelope
from the ditch and said--

‘Now then, what’s up?’

The biggest of the three men immediately knocked him down. He lay still.

The biggest then said, ‘Come on--any more of you? Come on!’

Oswald was so enraged at this cowardly attack that he actually hit out
at the big man--and he really got one in just above the belt. Then he
shut his eyes, because he felt that now all was indeed up. There was
a shout and a scuffle, and Oswald opened his eyes in astonishment at
finding himself still whole and unimpaired. Our own tramp had artfully
simulated insensibleness, to get the men off their guard, and then had
suddenly got his arms round a leg each of two of the men, and pulled
them to the ground, helped by Dicky, who saw his game and rushed in at
the same time, exactly like Oswald would have done if he had not had his
eyes shut ready to meet his doom.

The unpleasant boys shouted, and the third man tried to help his
unrespectable friends, now on their backs involved in a desperate
struggle with our own tramp, who was on top of them, accompanied by
Dicky. It all happened in a minute, and it was all mixed up. The dogs
were growling and barking--Martha had one of the men by the trouser
leg and Pincher had another; the girls were screaming like mad and the
strange boys shouted and laughed (little beasts!), and then suddenly our
Pig-man came round the corner, and two friends of his with him. He
had gone and fetched them to take care of us if anything unpleasant
occurred. It was a very thoughtful, and just like him.

‘Fetch the police!’ cried the Pig-man in noble tones, and H. O. started
running to do it. But the scoundrels struggled from under Dicky and our
tramp, shook off the dogs and some bits of trouser, and fled heavily
down the road.

Our Pig-man said, ‘Get along home!’ to the disagreeable boys, and
‘Shoo’d’ them as if they were hens, and they went. H. O. ran back when
they began to go up the road, and there we were, all standing breathless
in tears on the scene of the late desperate engagement. Oswald gives you
his word of honour that his and Dicky’s tears were tears of pure rage.
There are such things as tears of pure rage. Anyone who knows will tell
you so.

We picked up our own tramp and bathed the lump on his forehead with
lemonade. The water in the zinc bath had been upset in the struggle.
Then he and the Pig-man and his kind friends helped us carry our things
home.

The Pig-man advised us on the way not to try these sort of kind actions
without getting a grown-up to help us. We’ve been advised this before,
but now I really think we shall never try to be benevolent to the poor
and needy again. At any rate not unless we know them very well first.

We have seen our own tramp often since. The Pig-man gave him a job. He
has got work to do at last. The Pig-man says he is not such a very bad
chap, only he will fall asleep after the least drop of drink. We know
that is his failing. We saw it at once. But it was lucky for us he fell
asleep that day near our benevolent bar.

I will not go into what my father said about it all. There was a good
deal in it about minding your own business--there generally is in most
of the talkings-to we get. But he gave our tramp a sovereign, and the
Pig-man says he went to sleep on it for a solid week.



CHAPTER 12. THE CANTERBURY PILGRIMS

The author of these few lines really does hope to goodness that no one
will be such an owl as to think from the number of things we did when we
were in the country, that we were wretched, neglected little children,
whose grown-up relations sparkled in the bright haunts of pleasure, and
whirled in the giddy what’s-its-name of fashion, while we were left to
weep forsaken at home. It was nothing of the kind, and I wish you to
know that my father was with us a good deal--and Albert’s uncle (who is
really no uncle of ours, but only of Albert next door when we lived
in Lewisham) gave up a good many of his valuable hours to us. And the
father of Denny and Daisy came now and then, and other people, quite as
many as we wished to see. And we had some very decent times with them;
and enjoyed ourselves very much indeed, thank you. In some ways the
good times you have with grown-ups are better than the ones you have by
yourselves. At any rate they are safer. It is almost impossible, then,
to do anything fatal without being pulled up short by a grown-up ere yet
the deed is done. And, if you are careful, anything that goes wrong can
be looked on as the grown-up’s fault. But these secure pleasures are not
so interesting to tell about as the things you do when there is no one
to stop you on the edge of the rash act.

It is curious, too, that many of our most interesting games happened
when grown-ups were far away. For instance when we were pilgrims.

It was just after the business of the Benevolent Bar, and it was a wet
day. It is not easy to amuse yourself indoors on a wet day as older
people seem to think, especially when you are far removed from your
own home, and haven’t got all your own books and things. The girls were
playing Halma--which is a beastly game--Noel was writing poetry, H. O.
was singing ‘I don’t know what to do’ to the tune of ‘Canaan’s happy
shore’. It goes like this, and is very tiresome to listen to--

     ‘I don’t know what to do--oo--oo--oo!
     I don’t know what to do--oo--oo!
     It IS a beastly rainy day
     And I don’t know what to do.’

The rest of us were trying to make him shut up. We put a carpet bag over
his head, but he went on inside it; and then we sat on him, but he sang
under us; we held him upside down and made him crawl head first under
the sofa, but when, even there, he kept it up, we saw that nothing short
of violence would induce him to silence, so we let him go. And then he
said we had hurt him, and we said we were only in fun, and he said if
we were he wasn’t, and ill feeling might have grown up even out of a
playful brotherly act like ours had been, only Alice chucked the Halma
and said--

‘Let dogs delight. Come on--let’s play something.’

Then Dora said, ‘Yes, but look here. Now we’re together I do want to say
something. What about the Wouldbegoods Society?’

Many of us groaned, and one said, ‘Hear! hear!’ I will not say which
one, but it was not Oswald.

‘No, but really,’ Dora said, ‘I don’t want to be preachy--but you know
we DID say we’d try to be good. And it says in a book I was reading only
yesterday that NOT being naughty is not enough. You must BE good. And
we’ve hardly done anything. The Golden Deed book’s almost empty.’

‘Couldn’t we have a book of leaden deeds?’ said Noel, coming out of his
poetry, ‘then there’d be plenty for Alice to write about if she wants
to, or brass or zinc or aluminium deeds? We shan’t ever fill the book
with golden ones.’

H. O. had rolled himself in the red tablecloth and said Noel was only
advising us to be naughty, and again peace waved in the balance. But
Alice said, ‘Oh, H. O., DON’T--he didn’t mean that; but really and
truly, I wish wrong things weren’t so interesting. You begin to do a
noble act, and then it gets so exciting, and before you know where you
are you are doing something wrong as hard as you can lick.’

‘And enjoying it too’ Dick said.

‘It’s very curious,’ Denny said, ‘but you don’t seem to be able to be
certain inside yourself whether what you’re doing is right if you happen
to like doing it, but if you don’t like doing it you know quite well. I
only thought of that just now. I wish Noel would make a poem about it.’

‘I am,’ Noel said; ‘it began about a crocodile but it is finishing
itself up quite different from what I meant it to at first. Just wait a
minute.’


He wrote very hard while his kind brothers and sisters and his little
friends waited the minute he had said, and then he read:

      'The crocodile is very wise,
      He lives in the Nile with little eyes,
      He eats the hippopotamus too,
      And if he could he would eat up you.

      'The lovely woods and starry skies
      He looks upon with glad surprise!
      He sees the riches of the east,
      And the tiger and lion, kings of beast.

      'So let all be good and beware
      Of saying shan't and won't and don't care;
      For doing wrong is easier far
      Than any of the right things I know about are.

And I couldn’t make it king of beasts because of it not rhyming with
east, so I put the s off beasts on to king. It comes even in the end.’

We all said it was a very nice piece of poetry. Noel gets really ill if
you don’t like what he writes, and then he said, ‘If it’s trying that’s
wanted, I don’t care how hard we TRY to be good, but we may as well
do it some nice way. Let’s be Pilgrim’s Progress, like I wanted to at
first.’

And we were all beginning to say we didn’t want to, when suddenly Dora
said, ‘Oh, look here! I know. We’ll be the Canterbury Pilgrims. People
used to go pilgrimages to make themselves good.’

‘With peas in their shoes,’ the Dentist said. ‘It’s in a piece of
poetry--only the man boiled his peas--which is quite unfair.’

‘Oh, yes,’ said H. O., ‘and cocked hats.’

‘Not cocked--cockled’--it was Alice who said this. ‘And they had staffs
and scrips, and they told each other tales. We might as well.’

Oswald and Dora had been reading about the Canterbury Pilgrims in a book
called A Short History of the English People. It is not at all short
really--three fat volumes--but it has jolly good pictures. It was
written by a gentleman named Green. So Oswald said--

‘All right. I’ll be the Knight.’

‘I’ll be the wife of Bath,’ Dora said. ‘What will you be, Dicky?’

‘Oh, I don’t care, I’ll be Mr Bath if you like.’

‘We don’t know much about the people,’ Alice said. ‘How many were
there?’

‘Thirty,’ Oswald replied, ‘but we needn’t be all of them. There’s a
Nun-Priest.’

‘Is that a man or a woman?’

Oswald said he could not be sure by the picture, but Alice and Noel
could be it between them. So that was settled. Then we got the book and
looked at the dresses to see if we could make up dresses for the parts.
At first we thought we would, because it would be something to do,
and it was a very wet day; but they looked difficult, especially the
Miller’s. Denny wanted to be the Miller, but in the end he was the
Doctor, because it was next door to Dentist, which is what we call him
for short. Daisy was to be the Prioress--because she is good, and has
‘a soft little red mouth’, and H. O. WOULD be the Manciple (I don’t know
what that is), because the picture of him is bigger than most of the
others, and he said Manciple was a nice portmanteau word--half mandarin
and half disciple.

‘Let’s get the easiest parts of the dresses ready first.’ Alice
said--‘the pilgrims’ staffs and hats and the cockles.’

So Oswald and Dicky braved the fury of the elements and went into the
wood beyond the orchard to cut ash-sticks. We got eight jolly good long
ones. Then we took them home, and the girls bothered till we changed our
clothes, which were indeed sopping with the elements we had faced.

Then we peeled the sticks. They were nice and white at first, but they
soon got dirty when we carried them. It is a curious thing: however
often you wash your hands they always seem to come off on anything
white. And we nailed paper rosettes to the tops of them. That was the
nearest we could get to cockle-shells.

‘And we may as well have them there as on our hats,’ Alice said. ‘And
let’s call each other by our right names to-day, just to get into it.
Don’t you think so, Knight?’

‘Yea, Nun-Priest,’ Oswald was replying, but Noel said she was only half
the Nun-Priest, and again a threat of unpleasantness darkened the air.
But Alice said--

‘Don’t be a piggy-wiggy, Noel, dear; you can have it all, I don’t want
it. I’ll just be a plain pilgrim, or Henry who killed Becket.’

So she was called the Plain Pilgrim, and she did not mind.

We thought of cocked hats, but they are warm to wear, and the big garden
hats that make you look like pictures on the covers of plantation songs
did beautifully. We put cockle-shells on them. Sandals we did try, with
pieces of oil-cloth cut the shape of soles and fastened with tape, but
the dust gets into your toes so, and we decided boots were better for
such a long walk. Some of the pilgrims who were very earnest decided
to tie their boots with white tape crossed outside to pretend sandals.
Denny was one of these earnest palmers. As for dresses, there was no
time to make them properly, and at first we thought of nightgowns; but
we decided not to, in case people in Canterbury were not used to that
sort of pilgrim nowadays. We made up our minds to go as we were--or as
we might happen to be next day.

You will be ready to believe we hoped next day would be fine. It was.

Fair was the morn when the pilgrims arose and went down to breakfast.
Albert’s uncle had had brekker early and was hard at work in his study.
We heard his quill pen squeaking when we listened at the door. It is not
wrong to listen at doors when there is only one person inside, because
nobody would tell itself secrets aloud when it was alone.

We got lunch from the housekeeper, Mrs Pettigrew. She seems almost to
LIKE us all to go out and take our lunch with us. Though I should think
it must be very dull for her all alone. I remember, though, that Eliza,
our late general at Lewisham, was just the same. We took the dear dogs
of course. Since the Tower of Mystery happened we are not allowed to go
anywhere without the escort of these faithful friends of man. We did not
take Martha, because bull-dogs do not like walks. Remember this if you
ever have one of those valuable animals.

When we were all ready, with our big hats and cockle-shells, and our
staves and our tape sandals, the pilgrims looked very nice.

‘Only we haven’t any scrips,’ Dora said. ‘What is a scrip?’

‘I think it’s something to read. A roll of parchment or something.’

So we had old newspapers rolled up, and carried them in our hands. We
took the Globe and the Westminster Gazette because they are pink and
green. The Dentist wore his white sandshoes, sandalled with black tape,
and bare legs. They really looked almost as good as bare feet.

‘We OUGHT to have peas in our shoes,’ he said. But we did not think so.
We knew what a very little stone in your boot will do, let alone peas.

Of course we knew the way to go to Canterbury, because the old Pilgrims’
Road runs just above our house. It is a very pretty road, narrow, and
often shady. It is nice for walking, but carts do not like it because it
is rough and rutty; so there is grass growing in patches on it.

I have said that it was a fine day, which means that it was not raining,
but the sun did not shine all the time.

‘’Tis well, O Knight,’ said Alice, ‘that the orb of day shines not in
undi--what’s-its-name?--splendour.’

‘Thou sayest sooth, Plain Pilgrim,’ replied Oswald. ‘’Tis jolly warm
even as it is.’

‘I wish I wasn’t two people,’ Noel said, ‘it seems to make me hotter. I
think I’ll be a Reeve or something.’


But we would not let him, and we explained that if he hadn’t been so
beastly particular Alice would have been half of him, and he had only
himself to thank if being all of a Nun-Priest made him hot.

But it WAS warm certainly, and it was some time since we’d gone so far
in boots. Yet when H. O. complained we did our duty as pilgrims and
made him shut up. He did as soon as Alice said that about whining and
grizzling being below the dignity of a Manciple.

It was so warm that the Prioress and the wife of Bath gave up walking
with their arms round each other in their usual silly way (Albert’s
uncle calls it Laura Matildaing), and the Doctor and Mr Bath had to take
their jackets off and carry them.

I am sure if an artist or a photographer, or any person who liked
pilgrims, had seen us he would have been very pleased. The paper
cockle-shells were first-rate, but it was awkward having them on the top
of the staffs, because they got in your way when you wanted the staff to
use as a walking-stick.

We stepped out like a man all of us, and kept it up as well as we could
in book-talk, and at first all was merry as a dinner-bell; but presently
Oswald, who was the ‘very perfect gentle knight’, could not help
noticing that one of us was growing very silent and rather pale, like
people are when they have eaten something that disagrees with them
before they are quite sure of the fell truth.

So he said, ‘What’s up, Dentist, old man?’ quite kindly and like a
perfect knight, though, of course, he was annoyed with Denny. It is
sickening when people turn pale in the middle of a game and everything
is spoiled, and you have to go home, and tell the spoiler how sorry you
are that he is knocked up, and pretend not to mind about the game being
spoiled.

Denny said, ‘Nothing’, but Oswald knew better.

Then Alice said, ‘Let’s rest a bit, Oswald, it IS hot.’

‘Sir Oswald, if you please, Plain Pilgrim,’ returned her brother
dignifiedly. ‘Remember I’m a knight.’

So then we sat down and had lunch, and Denny looked better. We played
adverbs, and twenty questions, and apprenticing your son, for a bit in
the shade, and then Dicky said it was time to set sail if we meant to
make the port of Canterbury that night. Of course, pilgrims reck not of
ports, but Dicky never does play the game thoughtfully.

We went on. I believe we should have got to Canterbury all right and
quite early, only Denny got paler and paler, and presently Oswald saw,
beyond any doubt, that he was beginning to walk lame.

‘Shoes hurt you, Dentist?’ he said, still with kind striving
cheerfulness.

‘Not much--it’s all right,’ returned the other.

So on we went--but we were all a bit tired now--and the sun was hotter
and hotter; the clouds had gone away. We had to begin to sing to keep up
our spirits. We sang ‘The British Grenadiers’ and ‘John Brown’s Body’,
which is grand to march to, and a lot of others. We were just starting
on ‘Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are marching’, when Denny stopped
short. He stood first on one foot and then on the other, and suddenly
screwed up his face and put his knuckles in his eyes and sat down on
a heap of stones by the roadside. When we pulled his hands down he was
actually crying. The author does not wish to say it is babyish to cry.

‘Whatever is up?’ we all asked, and Daisy and Dora petted him to get him
to say, but he only went on howling, and said it was nothing, only would
we go on and leave him, and call for him as we came back.

Oswald thought very likely something had given Denny the stomach-ache,
and he did not like to say so before all of us, so he sent the others
away and told them to walk on a bit.

Then he said, ‘Now, Denny, don’t be a young ass. What is it? Is it
stomach-ache?’

And Denny stopped crying to say ‘No!’ as loud as he could.

‘Well, then,’ Oswald said, ‘look here, you’re spoiling the whole thing.
Don’t be a jackape, Denny. What is it?’

‘You won’t tell the others if I tell you?’

‘Not if you say not,’ Oswald answered in kindly tones.

‘Well, it’s my shoes.’

‘Take them off, man.’

‘You won’t laugh?’

‘NO!’ cried Oswald, so impatiently that the others looked back to see
why he was shouting. He waved them away, and with humble gentleness
began to undo the black-tape sandals.

Denny let him, crying hard all the time.

When Oswald had got off the first shoe the mystery was made plain to
him.

‘Well! Of all the--’ he said in proper indignation.

Denny quailed--though he said he did not--but then he doesn’t know what
quailing is, and if Denny did not quail then Oswald does not know what
quailing is either.

For when Oswald took the shoe off he naturally chucked it down and
gave it a kick, and a lot of little pinky yellow things rolled out. And
Oswald look closer at the interesting sight. And the little things were
SPLIT peas.

‘Perhaps you’ll tell me,’ said the gentle knight, with the politeness of
despair, ‘why on earth you’ve played the goat like this?’

‘Oh, don’t be angry,’ Denny said; and now his shoes were off, he curled
and uncurled his toes and stopped crying. ‘I KNEW pilgrims put peas in
their shoes--and--oh, I wish you wouldn’t laugh!’

‘I’m not,’ said Oswald, still with bitter politeness.

‘I didn’t want to tell you I was going to, because I wanted to be better
than all of you, and I thought if you knew I was going to you’d want to
too, and you wouldn’t when I said it first. So I just put some peas
in my pocket and dropped one or two at a time into my shoes when you
weren’t looking.’

In his secret heart Oswald said, ‘Greedy young ass.’ For it IS greedy to
want to have more of anything than other people, even goodness.

Outwardly Oswald said nothing.

‘You see’--Denny went on--‘I do want to be good. And if pilgriming is to
do you good, you ought to do it properly. I shouldn’t mind being hurt
in my feet if it would make me good for ever and ever. And besides, I
wanted to play the game thoroughly. You always say I don’t.’

The breast of the kind Oswald was touched by these last words.

‘I think you’re quite good enough,’ he said. ‘I’ll fetch back the
others--no, they won’t laugh.’

And we all went back to Denny, and the girls made a fuss with him. But
Oswald and Dicky were grave and stood aloof. They were old enough to see
that being good was all very well, but after all you had to get the boy
home somehow.

When they said this, as agreeably as they could, Denny said--

‘It’s all right--someone will give me a lift.’

‘You think everything in the world can be put right with a lift,’ Dicky
said, and he did not speak lovingly.

‘So it can,’ said Denny, ‘when it’s your feet. I shall easily get a lift
home.’

‘Not here you won’t,’ said Alice. ‘No one goes down this road; but the
high road’s just round the corner, where you see the telegraph wires.’

Dickie and Oswald made a sedan chair and carried Denny to the high road,
and we sat down in a ditch to wait. For a long time nothing went by
but a brewer’s dray. We hailed it, of course, but the man was so sound
asleep that our hails were vain, and none of us thought soon enough
about springing like a flash to the horses’ heads, though we all thought
of it directly the dray was out of sight.

So we had to keep on sitting there by the dusty road, and more than one
pilgrim was heard to say it wished we had never come. Oswald was not one
of those who uttered this useless wish.

At last, just when despair was beginning to eat into the vital parts of
even Oswald, there was a quick tap-tapping of horses’ feet on the road,
and a dogcart came in sight with a lady in it all alone.

We hailed her like the desperate shipwrecked mariners in the long-boat
hail the passing sail.

She pulled up. She was not a very old lady--twenty-five we found out
afterwards her age was--and she looked jolly.

‘Well,’ she said, ‘what’s the matter?’

‘It’s this poor little boy,’ Dora said, pointing to the Dentist, who had
gone to sleep in the dry ditch, with his mouth open as usual. ‘His feet
hurt him so, and will you give him a lift?’

‘But why are you all rigged out like this?’ asked the lady, looking at
our cockle-shells and sandals and things. We told her.

‘And how has he hurt his feet?’ she asked. And we told her that.

She looked very kind. ‘Poor little chap,’ she said. ‘Where do you want
to go?’

We told her that too. We had no concealments from this lady.

‘Well,’ she said, ‘I have to go on to--what is its name?’

‘Canterbury,’ said H. O.

‘Well, yes, Canterbury,’ she said; ‘it’s only about half a mile. I’ll
take the poor little pilgrim--and, yes, the three girls. You boys
must walk. Then we’ll have tea and see the sights, and I’ll drive you
home--at least some of you. How will that do?’

We thanked her very much indeed, and said it would do very nicely.

Then we helped Denny into the cart, and the girls got up, and the red
wheels of the cart spun away through the dust.

‘I wish it had been an omnibus the lady was driving,’ said H. O., ‘then
we could all have had a ride.’

‘Don’t you be so discontented,’ Dicky said. And Noel said--

‘You ought to be jolly thankful you haven’t got to carry Denny all the
way home on your back. You’d have had to if you’d been out alone with
him.’

When we got to Canterbury it was much smaller than we expected, and
the cathedral not much bigger than the Church that is next to the Moat
House. There seemed to be only one big street, but we supposed the rest
of the city was hidden away somewhere. There was a large inn, with
a green before it, and the red-wheeled dogcart was standing in the
stableyard and the lady, with Denny and the others, sitting on the
benches in the porch, looking out for us. The inn was called the ‘George
and Dragon’, and it made me think of the days when there were coaches
and highwaymen and foot-pads and jolly landlords, and adventures at
country inns, like you read about.

‘We’ve ordered tea,’ said the lady. ‘Would you like to wash your hands?’

We saw that she wished us to, so we said yes, we would. The girls and
Denny were already much cleaner than when we parted from them.

There was a courtyard to the inn and a wooden staircase outside the
house. We were taken up this, and washed our hands in a big room with
a fourpost wooden bed and dark red hangings--just the sort of hangings
that would not show the stains of gore in the dear old adventurous
times.

Then we had tea in a great big room with wooden chairs and tables, very
polished and old.

It was a very nice tea, with lettuces, and cold meat, and three kinds of
jam, as well as cake, and new bread, which we are not allowed at home.

While tea was being had, the lady talked to us. She was very kind.

There are two sorts of people in the world, besides others; one sort
understand what you’re driving at, and the other don’t. This lady was
the one sort.

After everyone had had as much to eat as they could possibly want, the
lady said, ‘What was it you particularly wanted to see at Canterbury?’

‘The cathedral,’ Alice said, ‘and the place where Thomas A Becket was
murdered.’

‘And the Danejohn,’ said Dicky.

Oswald wanted to see the walls, because he likes the Story of St Alphege
and the Danes.

‘Well, well,’ said the lady, and she put on her hat; it was a really
sensible one--not a blob of fluffy stuff and feathers put on sideways
and stuck on with long pins, and no shade to your face, but almost as
big as ours, with a big brim and red flowers, and black strings to tie
under your chin to keep it from blowing off.

Then we went out all together to see Canterbury. Dicky and Oswald took
it in turns to carry Denny on their backs. The lady called him ‘The
Wounded Comrade’.

We went first to the church. Oswald, whose quick brain was easily
aroused to suspicions, was afraid the lady might begin talking in the
church, but she did not. The church door was open. I remember mother
telling us once it was right and good for churches to be left open
all day, so that tired people could go in and be quiet, and say their
prayers, if they wanted to. But it does not seem respectful to talk out
loud in church. (See Note A.)

When we got outside the lady said, ‘You can imagine how on the chancel
steps began the mad struggle in which Becket, after hurling one of his
assailants, armour and all, to the ground--’

‘It would have been much cleverer,’ H. O. interrupted, ‘to hurl him
without his armour, and leave that standing up.’

‘Go on,’ said Alice and Oswald, when they had given H. O. a withering
glance. And the lady did go on. She told us all about Becket, and then
about St Alphege, who had bones thrown at him till he died, because he
wouldn’t tax his poor people to please the beastly rotten Danes.

And Denny recited a piece of poetry he knows called ‘The Ballad of
Canterbury’.

It begins about Danish warships snake-shaped, and ends about doing as
you’d be done by. It is long, but it has all the beef-bones in it, and
all about St Alphege.

Then the lady showed us the Danejohn, and it was like an oast-house.
And Canterbury walls that Alphege defied the Danes from looked down on
a quite common farmyard. The hospital was like a barn, and other things
were like other things, but we went all about and enjoyed it very
much. The lady was quite amusing, besides sometimes talking like a real
cathedral guide I met afterwards. (See Note B.) When at last we said we
thought Canterbury was very small considering, the lady said--

‘Well, it seemed a pity to come so far and not at least hear something
about Canterbury.’

And then at once we knew the worst, and Alice said--

‘What a horrid sell!’ But Oswald, with immediate courteousness, said--

‘I don’t care. You did it awfully well.’ And he did not say, though he
owns he thought of it--

‘I knew it all the time,’ though it was a great temptation. Because
really it was more than half true. He had felt from the first that this
was too small for Canterbury. (See Note C.)

The real name of the place was Hazelbridge, and not Canterbury at all.
We went to Canterbury another time. (See Note D.) We were not angry
with the lady for selling us about it being Canterbury, because she
had really kept it up first-rate. And she asked us if we minded, very
handsomely, and we said we liked it. But now we did not care how soon we
got home. The lady saw this, and said--

‘Come, our chariots are ready, and our horses caparisoned.’

That is a first-rate word out of a book. It cheered Oswald up, and he
liked her for using it, though he wondered why she said chariots. When
we got back to the inn I saw her dogcart was there, and a grocer’s cart
too, with B. Munn, grocer, Hazelbridge, on it. She took the girls in her
cart, and the boys went with the grocer. His horse was a very good one
to go, only you had to hit it with the wrong end of the whip. But the
cart was very bumpety.

The evening dews were falling--at least, I suppose so, but you do not
feel dew in a grocer’s cart--when we reached home. We all thanked the
lady very much, and said we hoped we should see her again some day. She
said she hoped so.

The grocer drove off, and when we had all shaken hands with the lady
and kissed her, according as we were boys or girls, or little boys, she
touched up her horse and drove away.

She turned at the corner to wave to us, and just as we had done waving,
and were turning into the house, Albert’s uncle came into our midst like
a whirling wind. He was in flannels, and his shirt had no stud in at the
neck, and his hair was all rumpled up and his hands were inky, and we
knew he had left off in the middle of a chapter by the wildness of his
eye.

‘Who was that lady?’ he said. ‘Where did you meet her?’

Mindful, as ever, of what he was told, Oswald began to tell the story
from the beginning.

‘The other day, protector of the poor,’ he began; ‘Dora and I were
reading about the Canterbury pilgrims...’

Oswald thought Albert’s uncle would be pleased to find his instructions
about beginning at the beginning had borne fruit, but instead he
interrupted.

‘Stow it, you young duffer! Where did you meet her?’

Oswald answered briefly, in wounded accents, ‘Hazelbridge.’

Then Albert’s uncle rushed upstairs three at a time, and as he went he
called out to Oswald--

‘Get out my bike, old man, and blow up the back tyre.’

I am sure Oswald was as quick as anyone could have been, but long
ere the tyre was thoroughly blowed Albert’s uncle appeared, with a
collar-stud and tie and blazer, and his hair tidy, and wrenching the
unoffending machine from Oswald’s surprised fingers.

Albert’s uncle finished pumping up the tyre, and then flinging himself
into the saddle he set off, scorching down the road at a pace not
surpassed by any highwayman, however black and high-mettled his steed.
We were left looking at each other. ‘He must have recognized her,’ Dicky
said.

‘Perhaps,’ Noel said, ‘she is the old nurse who alone knows the dark
secret of his highborn birth.’

‘Not old enough, by chalks,’ Oswald said.

‘I shouldn’t wonder,’ said Alice, ‘if she holds the secret of the will
that will make him rolling in long-lost wealth.’

‘I wonder if he’ll catch her,’ Noel said. ‘I’m quite certain all his
future depends on it. Perhaps she’s his long-lost sister, and the estate
was left to them equally, only she couldn’t be found, so it couldn’t be
shared up.’

‘Perhaps he’s only in love with her,’ Dora said, ‘parted by cruel Fate
at an early age, he has ranged the wide world ever since trying to find
her.’

‘I hope to goodness he hasn’t--anyway, he’s not ranged since we knew
him--never further than Hastings,’ Oswald said. ‘We don’t want any of
that rot.’

‘What rot?’ Daisy asked. And Oswald said--

‘Getting married, and all that sort of rubbish.’

And Daisy and Dora were the only ones that didn’t agree with him. Even
Alice owned that being bridesmaids must be fairly good fun. It’s no
good. You may treat girls as well as you like, and give them every
comfort and luxury, and play fair just as if they were boys, but there
is something unmanly about the best of girls. They go silly, like milk
goes sour, without any warning.

When Albert’s uncle returned he was very hot, with a beaded brow, but
pale as the Dentist when the peas were at their worst.

‘Did you catch her?’ H. O. asked.

Albert’s uncle’s brow looked black as the cloud that thunder will
presently break from. ‘No,’ he said.

‘Is she your long-lost nurse?’ H. O. went on, before we could stop him.

‘Long-lost grandmother! I knew the lady long ago in India,’ said
Albert’s uncle, as he left the room, slamming the door in a way we
should be forbidden to.

And that was the end of the Canterbury Pilgrimage.

As for the lady, we did not then know whether she was his long-lost
grandmother that he had known in India or not, though we thought she
seemed youngish for the part. We found out afterwards whether she was
or not, but that comes in another part. His manner was not the one that
makes you go on asking questions. The Canterbury Pilgriming did not
exactly make us good, but then, as Dora said, we had not done anything
wrong that day. So we were twenty-four hours to the good.


     Note A.--Afterwards we went and saw real Canterbury.  It is
very large. A disagreeable man showed us round the cathedral, and jawed
all the time quite loud as if it wasn’t a church. I remember one thing
he said. It was this:

‘This is the Dean’s Chapel; it was the Lady Chapel in the wicked days
when people used to worship the Virgin Mary.’

And H. O. said, ‘I suppose they worship the Dean now?’

Some strange people who were there laughed out loud. I think this is
worse in church than not taking your cap off when you come in, as H. O.
forgot to do, because the cathedral was so big he didn’t think it was a
church.

CHAPTER 13. THE DRAGON’S TEETH; OR, ARMY-SEED

Albert’s uncle was out on his bicycle as usual. After the day when we
became Canterbury Pilgrims and were brought home in the dog-cart with
red wheels by the lady he told us was his long-lost grandmother he had
known years ago in India, he spent not nearly so much of his time
in writing, and he used to shave every morning instead of only when
requisite, as in earlier days. And he was always going out on his
bicycle in his new Norfolk suit. We are not so unobserving as grown-up
people make out. We knew well enough he was looking for the long-lost.
And we jolly well wished he might find her. Oswald, always full of
sympathy with misfortune, however undeserved, had himself tried several
times to find the lady. So had the others. But all this is what they
call a digression; it has nothing to do with the dragon’s teeth I am now
narrating.

It began with the pig dying--it was the one we had for the circus, but
it having behaved so badly that day had nothing to do with its illness
and death, though the girls said they felt remorse, and perhaps if we
hadn’t made it run so that day it might have been spared to us. But
Oswald cannot pretend that people were right just because they happen to
be dead, and as long as that pig was alive we all knew well enough that
it was it that made us run--and not us it.

The pig was buried in the kitchen garden. Bill, that we made the
tombstone for, dug the grave, and while he was away at his dinner we
took a turn at digging, because we like to be useful, and besides, when
you dig you never know what you may turn up. I knew a man once that
found a gold ring on the point of his fork when he was digging potatoes,
and you know how we found two half-crowns ourselves once when we were
digging for treasure.

Oswald was taking his turn with the spade, and the others were sitting
on the gravel and telling him how to do it.

‘Work with a will,’ Dicky said, yawning.

Alice said, ‘I wish we were in a book. People in books never dig without
finding something. I think I’d rather it was a secret passage than
anything.’

Oswald stopped to wipe his honest brow ere replying.

‘A secret’s nothing when you’ve found it out. Look at the secret
staircase. It’s no good, not even for hide-and-seek, because of its
squeaking. I’d rather have the pot of gold we used to dig for when we
were little.’ It was really only last year, but you seem to grow old
very quickly after you have once passed the prime of your youth, which
is at ten, I believe.

‘How would you like to find the mouldering bones of Royalist soldiers
foully done to death by nasty Ironsides?’ Noel asked, with his mouth full
of plum.

‘If they were really dead it wouldn’t matter,’ Dora said. ‘What I’m
afraid of is a skeleton that can walk about and catch at your legs when
you’re going upstairs to bed.’ ‘Skeletons can’t walk,’ Alice said in a
hurry; ‘you know they can’t, Dora.’

And she glared at Dora till she made her sorry she had said what she
had. The things you are frightened of, or even those you would rather
not meet in the dark, should never be mentioned before the little ones,
or else they cry when it comes to bed-time, and say it was because of
what you said.

‘We shan’t find anything. No jolly fear,’ said Dicky.

And just then my spade I was digging with struck on something hard,
and it felt hollow. I did really think for one joyful space that we had
found that pot of gold. But the thing, whatever it was, seemed to be
longish; longer, that is, than a pot of gold would naturally be. And as
I uncovered it I saw that it was not at all pot-of-gold-colour, but like
a bone Pincher has buried. So Oswald said--

‘It IS the skeleton.’

The girls all drew back, and Alice said, ‘Oswald, I wish you wouldn’t.’

A moment later the discovery was unearthed, and Oswald lifted it up,
with both hands.

‘It’s a dragon’s head,’ Noel said, and it certainly looked like it.

It was long and narrowish and bony, and with great yellow teeth sticking
in the jaw.

Bill came back just then and said it was a horse’s head, but H. O. and
Noel would not believe it, and Oswald owns that no horse he has ever
seen had a head at all that shape.

But Oswald did not stop to argue, because he saw a keeper who showed me
how to set snares going by, and he wanted to talk to him about ferrets,
so he went off and Dicky and Denny and Alice with him. Also Daisy and
Dora went off to finish reading Ministering Children. So H. O. and Noel
were left with the bony head. They took it away.

The incident had quite faded from the mind of Oswald next day. But just
before breakfast Noel and H. O. came in, looking hot and anxious. They
had got up early and had not washed at all--not even their hands and
faces. Noel made Oswald a secret signal. All the others saw it, and with
proper delicate feeling pretended not to have.

When Oswald had gone out with Noel and H. O. in obedience to the secret
signal, Noel said--

‘You know that dragon’s head yesterday?’

‘Well?’ Oswald said quickly, but not crossly--the two things are quite
different.

‘Well, you know what happened in Greek history when some chap sowed
dragon’s teeth?’

‘They came up armed men,’ said H. O., but Noel sternly bade him shut up,
and Oswald said ‘Well,’ again. If he spoke impatiently it was because he
smelt the bacon being taken in to breakfast.

‘Well,’ Noel went on, ‘what do you suppose would have come up if we’d
sowed those dragon’s teeth we found yesterday?’

‘Why, nothing, you young duffer,’ said Oswald, who could now smell the
coffee. ‘All that isn’t History it’s Humbug. Come on in to brekker.’

‘It’s NOT humbug,’ H. O. cried, ‘it is history. We DID sow--’

‘Shut up,’ said Noel again. ‘Look here, Oswald. We did sow those
dragon’s teeth in Randall’s ten-acre meadow, and what do you think has
come up?’

‘Toadstools I should think,’ was Oswald’s contemptible rejoinder.

‘They have come up a camp of soldiers,’ said Noel--ARMED MEN. So you see
it WAS history. We have sowed army-seed, just like Cadmus, and it has
come up. It was a very wet night. I daresay that helped it along.’

Oswald could not decide which to disbelieve--his brother or his ears.
So, disguising his doubtful emotions without a word, he led the way to
the bacon and the banqueting hall.

He said nothing about the army-seed then, neither did Noel and H. O. But
after the bacon we went into the garden, and then the good elder brother
said--

‘Why don’t you tell the others your cock-and-bull story?’

So they did, and their story was received with warm expressions of
doubt. It was Dicky who observed--

‘Let’s go and have a squint at Randall’s ten-acre, anyhow. I saw a hare
there the other day.’

We went. It is some little way, and as we went, disbelief reigned superb
in every breast except Noel’s and H. O.’s, so you will see that even the
ready pen of the present author cannot be expected to describe to you
his variable sensations when he got to the top of the hill and suddenly
saw that his little brothers had spoken the truth. I do not mean that
they generally tell lies, but people make mistakes sometimes, and the
effect is the same as lies if you believe them.

There WAS a camp there with real tents and soldiers in grey and red
tunics. I daresay the girls would have said coats. We stood in ambush,
too astonished even to think of lying in it, though of course we know
that this is customary. The ambush was the wood on top of the little
hill, between Randall’s ten-acre meadow and Sugden’s Waste Wake pasture.

‘There would be cover here for a couple of regiments,’ whispered Oswald,
who was, I think, gifted by Fate with the far-seeingness of a born
general.

Alice merely said ‘Hist’, and we went down to mingle with the troops as
though by accident, and seek for information.

The first man we came to at the edge of the camp was cleaning a sort of
cauldron thing like witches brew bats in.

We went up to him and said, ‘Who are you? Are you English, or are you
the enemy?’

‘We’re the enemy,’ he said, and he did not seem ashamed of being what he
was. And he spoke English with quite a good accent for a foreigner.

‘The enemy!’ Oswald echoed in shocked tones. It is a terrible thing to
a loyal and patriotic youth to see an enemy cleaning a pot in an English
field, with English sand, and looking as much at home as if he was in
his foreign fastnesses.

The enemy seemed to read Oswald’s thoughts with deadly unerringness. He
said--

‘The English are somewhere over on the other side of the hill. They are
trying to keep us out of Maidstone.’

After this our plan of mingling with the troops did not seem worth going
on with. This soldier, in spite of his unerringness in reading Oswald’s
innermost heart, seemed not so very sharp in other things, or he would
never have given away his secret plans like this, for he must have
known from our accents that we were Britons to the backbone. Or perhaps
(Oswald thought this, and it made his blood at once boil and freeze,
which our uncle had told us was possible, but only in India), perhaps he
thought that Maidstone was already as good as taken and it didn’t matter
what he said. While Oswald was debating within his intellect what to
say next, and how to say it so as to discover as many as possible of the
enemy’s dark secrets, Noel said--

‘How did you get here? You weren’t here yesterday at tea-time.’

The soldier gave the pot another sandy rub, and said--

‘I daresay it does seem quick work--the camp seems as if it had sprung
up in the night, doesn’t it?--like a mushroom.’

Alice and Oswald looked at each other, and then at the rest of us. The
words ‘sprung up in the night’ seemed to touch a string in every heart.

‘You see,’ whispered Noel, ‘he won’t tell us how he came here. NOW, is
it humbug or history?’

Oswald, after whisperedly requesting his young brother to dry up and not
bother, remarked, ‘Then you’re an invading army?’

‘Well,’ said the soldier, ‘we’re a skeleton battalion, as a matter of
fact, but we’re invading all right enough.’

And now indeed the blood of the stupidest of us froze, just as the
quick-witted Oswald’s had done earlier in the interview. Even H. O.
opened his mouth and went the colour of mottled soap; he is so fat that
this is the nearest he can go to turning pale. Denny said, ‘But you
don’t look like skeletons.’

The soldier stared, then he laughed and said, ‘Ah, that’s the padding in
our tunics. You should see us in the grey dawn taking our morning bath
in a bucket.’ It was a dreadful picture for the imagination. A skeleton,
with its bones all loose most likely, bathing anyhow in a pail. There
was a silence while we thought it over.

Now, ever since the cleaning-cauldron soldier had said that about taking
Maidstone, Alice had kept on pulling at Oswald’s jacket behind, and he
had kept on not taking any notice. But now he could not stand it any
longer, so he said--

‘Well, what is it?’

Alice drew him aside, or rather, she pulled at his jacket so that he
nearly fell over backwards, and then she whispered, ‘Come along, don’t
stay parlaying with the foe. He’s only talking to you to gain time.’

‘What for?’ said Oswald.

‘Why, so that we shouldn’t warn the other army, you silly,’ Alice said,
and Oswald was so upset by what she said, that he forgot to be properly
angry with her for the wrong word she used.

‘But we ought to warn them at home,’ she said--’ suppose the Moat House
was burned down, and all the supplies commandeered for the foe?’

Alice turned boldly to the soldier. ‘DO you burn down farms?’ she asked.

‘Well, not as a rule,’ he said, and he had the cheek to wink at Oswald,
but Oswald would not look at him. ‘We’ve not burned a farm since--oh,
not for years.’

‘A farm in Greek history it was, I expect,’ Denny murmured. ‘Civilized
warriors do not burn farms nowadays,’ Alice said sternly, ‘whatever they
did in Greek times. You ought to know that.’

The soldier said things had changed a good deal since Greek times.

So we said good morning as quickly as we could: it is proper to be
polite even to your enemy, except just at the moments when it has really
come to rifles and bayonets or other weapons.

The soldier said ‘So long!’ in quite a modern voice, and we retraced our
footsteps in silence to the ambush--I mean the wood. Oswald did think of
lying in the ambush then, but it was rather wet, because of the rain the
night before, that H. O. said had brought the army-seed up. And Alice
walked very fast, saying nothing but ‘Hurry up, can’t you!’ and dragging
H. O. by one hand and Noel by the other. So we got into the road.

Then Alice faced round and said, ‘This is all our fault. If we hadn’t
sowed those dragon’s teeth there wouldn’t have been any invading army.’

I am sorry to say Daisy said, ‘Never mind, Alice, dear. WE didn’t sow
the nasty things, did we, Dora?’

But Denny told her it was just the same. It was WE had done it, so long
as it was any of us, especially if it got any of us into trouble. Oswald
was very pleased to see that the Dentist was beginning to understand
the meaning of true manliness, and about the honour of the house of
Bastable, though of course he is only a Foulkes. Yet it is something to
know he does his best to learn.

If you are very grown-up, or very clever, I daresay you will now have
thought of a great many things. If you have you need not say anything,
especially if you’re reading this aloud to anybody. It’s no good putting
in what you think in this part, because none of us thought anything of
the kind at the time.

We simply stood in the road without any of your clever thoughts, filled
with shame and distress to think of what might happen owing to the
dragon’s teeth being sown. It was a lesson to us never to sow seed
without being quite sure what sort it is. This is particularly true of
the penny packets, which sometimes do not come up at all, quite unlike
dragon’s teeth.

Of course H. O. and Noel were more unhappy than the rest of us. This was
only fair.

‘How can we possibly prevent their getting to Maidstone?’ Dickie said.
‘Did you notice the red cuffs on their uniforms? Taken from the bodies
of dead English soldiers, I shouldn’t wonder.’

‘If they’re the old Greek kind of dragon’s-teeth soldiers, they ought to
fight each other to death,’ Noel said; ‘at least, if we had a helmet to
throw among them.’

But none of us had, and it was decided that it would be of no use for
H. O. to go back and throw his straw hat at them, though he wanted to.
Denny said suddenly--

‘Couldn’t we alter the sign-posts, so that they wouldn’t know the way to
Maidstone?’

Oswald saw that this was the time for true generalship to be shown.

He said--

‘Fetch all the tools out of your chest--Dicky go too, there’s a good
chap, and don’t let him cut his legs with the saw.’ He did once,
tumbling over it. ‘Meet us at the cross-roads, you know, where we had
the Benevolent Bar. Courage and dispatch, and look sharp about it.’

When they had gone we hastened to the crossroads, and there a great idea
occurred to Oswald. He used the forces at his command so ably that in
a very short time the board in the field which says ‘No thoroughfare.
Trespassers will be prosecuted’ was set up in the middle of the road to
Maidstone. We put stones, from a heap by the road, behind it to make it
stand up.

Then Dicky and Denny came back, and Dicky shinned up the sign-post and
sawed off the two arms, and we nailed them up wrong, so that it said ‘To
Maidstone’ on the Dover Road, and ‘To Dover’ on the road to Maidstone.
We decided to leave the Trespassers board on the real Maidstone road, as
an extra guard.

Then we settled to start at once to warn Maidstone.

Some of us did not want the girls to go, but it would have been unkind
to say so. However, there was at least one breast that felt a pang of
joy when Dora and Daisy gave out that they would rather stay where they
were and tell anybody who came by which was the real road.

‘Because it would be so dreadful if someone was going to buy pigs or
fetch a doctor or anything in a hurry and then found they had got to
Dover instead of where they wanted to go to,’ Dora said. But when it
came to dinner-time they went home, so that they were entirely out of
it. This often happens to them by some strange fatalism.

We left Martha to take care of the two girls, and Lady and Pincher went
with us. It was getting late in the day, but I am bound to remember no
one said anything about their dinners, whatever they may have thought.
We cannot always help our thoughts. We happened to know it was roast
rabbits and currant jelly that day.

We walked two and two, and sang the ‘British Grenadiers’ and ‘Soldiers
of the queen’ so as to be as much part of the British Army as possible.
The Cauldron-Man had said the English were the other side of the hill.
But we could not see any scarlet anywhere, though we looked for it as
carefully as if we had been fierce bulls.

But suddenly we went round a turn in the road and came plump into a lot
of soldiers. Only they were not red-coats. They were dressed in grey
and silver. And it was a sort of furzy-common place, and three roads
branching out. The men were lying about, with some of their belts
undone, smoking pipes and cigarettes.

‘It’s not British soldiers,’ Alice said. ‘Oh dear, oh dear, I’m afraid
it’s more enemy. You didn’t sow the army-seed anywhere else, did you, H.
O. dear?’

H. O. was positive he hadn’t. ‘But perhaps lots more came up where we
did sow them,’ he said; ‘they’re all over England by now very likely.
_I_ don’t know how many men can grow out of one dragon’s tooth.’

Then Noel said, ‘It was my doing anyhow, and I’m not afraid,’ and he
walked straight up to the nearest soldier, who was cleaning his pipe
with a piece of grass, and said--

‘Please, are you the enemy?’ The man said--

‘No, young Commander-in-Chief, we’re the English.’

Then Oswald took command. ‘Where is the General?’ he said.

‘We’re out of generals just now, Field-Marshal,’ the man said, and his
voice was a gentleman’s voice. ‘Not a single one in stock. We might suit
you in majors now--and captains are quite cheap. Competent corporals
going for a song. And we have a very nice colonel, too quiet to ride or
drive.’

Oswald does not mind chaff at proper times. But this was not one.

‘You seem to be taking it very easy,’ he said with disdainful
expression.

‘This IS an easy,’ said the grey soldier, sucking at his pipe to see if
it would draw.

‘I suppose YOU don’t care if the enemy gets into Maidstone or not!’
exclaimed Oswald bitterly. ‘If I were a soldier I’d rather die than be
beaten.’

The soldier saluted. ‘Good old patriotic sentiment’ he said, smiling at
the heart-felt boy.

But Oswald could bear no more. ‘Which is the Colonel?’ he asked.

‘Over there--near the grey horse.’

‘The one lighting a cigarette?’ H. O. asked.

‘Yes--but I say, kiddie, he won’t stand any jaw. There’s not an ounce of
vice about him, but he’s peppery. He might kick out. You’d better bunk.’

‘Better what?’ asked H. O.

‘Bunk, bottle, scoot, skip, vanish, exit,’ said the soldier.

‘That’s what you’d do when the fighting begins,’ said H. O. He is often
rude like that--but it was what we all thought, all the same.

The soldier only laughed.

A spirited but hasty altercation among ourselves in whispers ended in
our allowing Alice to be the one to speak to the Colonel. It was she who
wanted to. ‘However peppery he is he won’t kick a girl,’ she said, and
perhaps this was true.

But of course we all went with her. So there were six of us to stand
in front of the Colonel. And as we went along we agreed that we would
salute him on the word three. So when we got near, Dick said, ‘One,
two, three’, and we all saluted very well--except H. O., who chose that
minute to trip over a rifle a soldier had left lying about, and was only
saved from falling by a man in a cocked hat who caught him deftly by the
back of his jacket and stood him on his legs.

‘Let go, can’t you,’ said H. O. ‘Are you the General?’

Before the Cocked Hat had time to frame a reply, Alice spoke to the
Colonel. I knew what she meant to say, because she had told me as we
threaded our way among the resting soldiery. What she really said was--

‘Oh, how CAN you!’

‘How can I WHAT?’ said the Colonel, rather crossly.

‘Why, SMOKE?’ said Alice.

‘My good children, if you’re an infant Band of Hope, let me recommend
you to play in some other backyard,’ said the Cock-Hatted Man.

H. O. said, ‘Band of Hope yourself’--but no one noticed it.

‘We’re NOT a Band of Hope,’ said Noel. ‘We’re British, and the man over
there told us you are. And Maidstone’s in danger, and the enemy not a
mile off, and you stand SMOKING.’ Noel was standing crying, himself, or
something very like it.

‘It’s quite true,’ Alice said.

The Colonel said, ‘Fiddle-de-dee.’

But the Cocked-Hatted Man said, ‘What was the enemy like?’ We told him
exactly. And even the Colonel then owned there might be something in it.

‘Can you show me the place where they are on the map?’ he asked.

‘Not on the map, we can’t,’ said Dicky--‘at least, I don’t think so,
but on the ground we could. We could take you there in a quarter of an
hour.’

The Cocked-Hatted One looked at the Colonel, who returned his scrutiny,
then he shrugged his shoulders.

‘Well, we’ve got to do something,’ he said, as if to himself. ‘Lead on,
Macduff.’

The Colonel roused his soldiery from their stupor of pipes by words of
command which the present author is sorry he can’t remember.

Then he bade us boys lead the way. I tell you it felt fine, marching
at the head of a regiment. Alice got a lift on the Cocked-Hatted One’s
horse. It was a red-roan steed of might, exactly as if it had been in
a ballad. They call a grey-roan a ‘blue’ in South Africa, the
Cocked-Hatted One said.

We led the British Army by unfrequented lanes till we got to the gate of
Sugden’s Waste Wake pasture. Then the Colonel called a whispered halt,
and choosing two of us to guide him, the dauntless and discerning
commander went on, on foot, with an orderly. He chose Dicky and Oswald
as guides. So we led him to the ambush, and we went through it as
quietly as we could. But twigs do crackle and snap so when you are
reconnoitring, or anxious to escape detection for whatever reason.

Our Colonel’s orderly crackled most. If you’re not near enough to tell
a colonel by the crown and stars on his shoulder-strap, you can tell him
by the orderly behind him, like ‘follow my leader’.

‘Look out!’ said Oswald in a low but commanding whisper, ‘the camp’s
down in that field. You can see if you take a squint through this gap.’

The speaker took a squint himself as he spoke, and drew back, baffled
beyond the power of speech. While he was struggling with his baffledness
the British Colonel had his squint. He also drew back, and said a word
that he must have known was not right--at least when he was a boy.

‘I don’t care,’ said Oswald, ‘they were there this morning. White tents
like mushrooms, and an enemy cleaning a cauldron.’

‘With sand,’ said Dicky.

‘That’s most convincing,’ said the Colonel, and I did not like the way
he said it.

‘I say,’ Oswald said, ‘let’s get to the top corner of the ambush--the
wood, I mean. You can see the crossroads from there.’

We did, and quickly, for the crackling of branches no longer dismayed
our almost despairing spirits.

We came to the edge of the wood, and Oswald’s patriotic heart really did
give a jump, and he cried, ‘There they are, on the Dover Road.’

Our miscellaneous signboard had done its work.

‘By Jove, young un, you’re right! And in quarter column, too! We’ve got
em on toast--on toast--egad!’ I never heard anyone not in a book say
‘egad’ before, so I saw something really out of the way was indeed up.

The Colonel was a man of prompt and decisive action. He sent the orderly
to tell the Major to advance two companies on the left flank and take
cover. Then we led him back through the wood the nearest way, because he
said he must rejoin the main body at once. We found the main body very
friendly with Noel and H. O. and the others, and Alice was talking to
the Cocked-Hatted One as if she had known him all her life.

‘I think he’s a general in disguise,’ Noel said. ‘He’s been giving us
chocolate out of a pocket in his saddle.’

Oswald thought about the roast rabbit then--and he is not ashamed to own
it--yet he did not say a word. But Alice is really not a bad sort. She
had saved two bars of chocolate for him and Dicky. Even in war girls can
sometimes be useful in their humble way.

The Colonel fussed about and said, ‘Take cover there!’ and everybody hid
in the ditch, and the horses and the Cocked Hat, with Alice, retreated
down the road out of sight. We were in the ditch too. It was muddy--but
nobody thought of their boots in that perilous moment. It seemed a long
time we were crouching there. Oswald began to feel the water squelching
in his boots, so we held our breath and listened. Oswald laid his ear to
the road like a Red Indian. You would not do this in time of peace, but
when your country is in danger you care but little about keeping your
ears clean. His backwoods’ strategy was successful. He rose and dusted
himself and said--‘They’re coming!’

It was true. The footsteps of the approaching foe were now to be heard
quite audibly, even by ears in their natural position. The wicked enemy
approached. They were marching with a careless swaggeringness that
showed how little they suspected the horrible doom which was about to
teach them England’s might and supremeness.

Just as the enemy turned the corner so that we could see them, the
Colonel shouted--‘Right section, fire!’ and there was a deafening
banging.

The enemy’s officer said something, and then the enemy got confused and
tried to get into the fields through the hedges. But all was vain. There
was firing now from our men, on the left as well as the right. And
then our Colonel strode nobly up to the enemy’s Colonel and demanded
surrender. He told me so afterwards. His exact words are only known to
himself and the other Colonel. But the enemy’s Colonel said, ‘I would
rather die than surrender,’ or words to that effect.

Our Colonel returned to his men and gave the order to fix bayonets, and
even Oswald felt his manly cheek turn pale at the thought of the amount
of blood to be shed. What would have happened can never now be revealed.
For at this moment a man on a piebald horse came clattering over a
hedge--as carelessly as if the air was not full of lead and steel at
all. Another man rode behind him with a lance and a red pennon on it. I
think he must have been the enemy’s General coming to tell his men not
to throw away their lives on a forlorn hope, for directly he said they
were captured the enemy gave in and owned that they were. The enemy’s
Colonel saluted and ordered his men to form quarter column again. I
should have thought he would have had about enough of that myself.

He had now given up all thought of sullen resistance to the bitter end.
He rolled a cigarette for himself, and had the foreign cheek to say to
our Colonel--

‘By Jove, old man, you got me clean that time! Your scouts seem to have
marked us down uncommonly neatly.’

It was a proud moment when our Colonel laid his military hand on
Oswald’s shoulder and said--

‘This is my chief scout’ which were high words, but not undeserved, and
Oswald owns he felt red with gratifying pride when he heard them.

‘So you are the traitor, young man,’ said the wicked Colonel, going on
with his cheek.

Oswald bore it because our Colonel had, and you should be generous to a
fallen foe, but it is hard to be called a traitor when you haven’t.

He did not treat the wicked Colonel with silent scorn as he might have
done, but he said--

‘We aren’t traitors. We are the Bastables and one of us is a Foulkes.
We only mingled unsuspected with the enemy’s soldiery and learned the
secrets of their acts, which is what Baden-Powell always does when the
natives rebel in South Africa; and Denis Foulkes thought of altering
the sign-posts to lead the foe astray. And if we did cause all this
fighting, and get Maidstone threatened with capture and all that, it
was only because we didn’t believe Greek things could happen in Great
Britain and Ireland, even if you sow dragon’s teeth, and besides, some
of us were not asked about sowing them.’

Then the Cocked-Hatted One led his horse and walked with us and made
us tell him all about it, and so did the Colonel. The wicked Colonel
listened too, which was only another proof of his cheek.

And Oswald told the tale in the modest yet manly way that some people
think he has, and gave the others all the credit they deserved. His
narration was interrupted no less than four times by shouts of ‘Bravo!’
in which the enemy’s Colonel once more showed his cheek by joining. By
the time the story was told we were in sight of another camp. It was the
British one this time. The Colonel asked us to have tea in his tent,
and it only shows the magnanimosity of English chivalry in the field of
battle that he asked the enemy’s Colonel too. With his usual cheek he
accepted. We were jolly hungry.

When everyone had had as much tea as they possibly could, the Colonel
shook hands with us all, and to Oswald he said--

‘Well, good-bye, my brave scout. I must mention your name in my
dispatches to the War Office.’

H. O. interrupted him to say, ‘His name’s Oswald Cecil Bastable, and
mine is Horace Octavius.’ I wish H. O. would learn to hold his tongue.
No one ever knows Oswald was christened Cecil as well, if he can
possibly help it. YOU didn’t know it till now.

‘Mr Oswald Bastable,’ the Colonel went on--he had the decency not to
take any notice of the ‘Cecil’--‘you would be a credit to any regiment.
No doubt the War Office will reward you properly for what you have done
for your country. But meantime, perhaps, you’ll accept five shillings
from a grateful comrade-in-arms.’ Oswald felt heart-felt sorry to wound
the good Colonel’s feelings, but he had to remark that he had only done
his duty, and he was sure no British scout would take five bob for doing
that. ‘And besides,’ he said, with that feeling of justice which is part
of his young character, ‘it was the others just as much as me.’

‘Your sentiments, Sir,’ said the Colonel who was one of the politest
and most discerning colonels I ever saw, ‘your sentiments do you honour.
But, Bastables all, and--and non-Bastables’ (he couldn’t remember
Foulkes; it’s not such an interesting name as Bastable, of course)--‘at
least you’ll accept a soldier’s pay?’

‘Lucky to touch it, a shilling a day!’ Alice and Denny said together.
And the Cocked-Hatted Man said something about knowing your own mind and
knowing your own Kipling.

‘A soldier,’ said the Colonel, ‘would certainly be lucky to touch it.
You see there are deductions for rations. Five shillings is exactly
right, deducting twopence each for six teas.’

This seemed cheap for the three cups of tea and the three eggs and all
the strawberry jam and bread-and-butter Oswald had had, as well as what
the others ate, and Lady’s and Pincher’s teas, but I suppose soldiers
get things cheaper than civilians, which is only right.

Oswald took the five shillings then, there being no longer any scruples
why he should not.

Just as we had parted from the brave Colonel and the rest we saw a
bicycle coming. It was Albert’s uncle. He got off and said--

‘What on earth have you been up to? What were you doing with those
volunteers?’

We told him the wild adventures of the day, and he listened, and then he
said he would withdraw the word volunteers if we liked.

But the seeds of doubt were sown in the breast of Oswald. He was now
almost sure that we had made jolly fools of ourselves without a moment’s
pause throughout the whole of this eventful day. He said nothing at the
time, but after supper he had it out with Albert’s uncle about the word
which had been withdrawn.

Albert’s uncle said, of course, no one could be sure that the dragon’s
teeth hadn’t come up in the good old-fashioned way, but that, on the
other hand, it was barely possible that both the British and the enemy
were only volunteers having a field-day or sham fight, and he rather
thought the Cocked-Hatted Man was not a general, but a doctor. And the
man with a red pennon carried behind him MIGHT have been the umpire.

Oswald never told the others a word of this. Their young breasts were
all panting with joy because they had saved their country; and it would
have been but heartless unkindness to show them how silly they had been.
Besides, Oswald felt he was much too old to have been so taken in--if
he HAD been. Besides, Albert’s uncle did say that no one could be sure
about the dragon’s teeth.

The thing that makes Oswald feel most that, perhaps, the whole thing was
a beastly sell, was that we didn’t see any wounded. But he tries not to
think of this. And if he goes into the army when he grows up, he will
not go quite green. He has had experience of the arts of war and the
tented field. And a real colonel has called him ‘Comrade-in-Arms’, which
is exactly what Lord Roberts called his own soldiers when he wrote home
about them.



CHAPTER 14. ALBERT’S UNCLE’s GRANDMOTHER; OR, THE LONG-LOST


The shadow of the termination now descended in sable thunder-clouds upon
our devoted nobs. As Albert’s uncle said, ‘School now gaped for its
prey’. In a very short space of time we should be wending our way back
to Blackheath, and all the variegated delightfulness of the country
would soon be only preserved in memory’s faded flowers. (I don’t care
for that way of writing very much. It would be an awful swot to keep it
up--looking out the words and all that.)

To speak in the language of everyday life, our holiday was jolly nearly
up. We had had a ripping time, but it was all but over. We really did
feel sorry--though, of course, it was rather decent to think of getting
back to Father and being able to tell the other chaps about our raft,
and the dam, and the Tower of Mystery, and things like that.

When but a brief time was left to us, Oswald and Dicky met by chance
in an apple-tree. (That sounds like ‘consequences’, but it is mere
truthfulness.) Dicky said--

‘Only four more days.’

Oswald said, ‘Yes.’

‘There’s one thing,’ Dickie said, ‘that beastly society. We don’t want
that swarming all over everything when we get home. We ought to dissolve
it before we leave here.’

The following dialogue now took place:

Oswald--‘Right you are. I always said it was piffling rot.’

Dicky--‘So did I.’

Oswald--‘Let’s call a council. But don’t forget we’ve jolly well got to
put our foot down.’

Dicky assented, and the dialogue concluded with apples.

The council, when called, was in but low spirits. This made Oswald’s and
Dicky’s task easier. When people are sunk in gloomy despair about one
thing, they will agree to almost anything about something else. (Remarks
like this are called philosophic generalizations, Albert’s uncle says.)
Oswald began by saying--

‘We’ve tried the society for being good in, and perhaps it’s done us
good. But now the time has come for each of us to be good or bad on his
own, without hanging on to the others.’

    ‘The race is run by one and one,
     But never by two and two,’

the Dentist said.

The others said nothing.

Oswald went on: ‘I move that we chuck--I mean dissolve--the Wouldbegoods
Society; its appointed task is done. If it’s not well done, that’s ITS
fault and not ours.’

Dicky said, ‘Hear! hear! I second this prop.’

The unexpected Dentist said, ‘I third it. At first I thought it would
help, but afterwards I saw it only made you want to be naughty, just
because you were a Wouldbegood.’

Oswald owns he was surprised. We put it to the vote at once, so as not
to let Denny cool. H. O. and Noel and Alice voted with us, so Daisy and
Dora were what is called a hopeless minority. We tried to cheer their
hopelessness by letting them read the things out of the Golden Deed
book aloud. Noel hid his face in the straw so that we should not see the
faces he made while he made poetry instead of listening, and when the
Wouldbegoods was by vote dissolved for ever he sat up, straws in his
hair, and said--


               THE EPITAPH

     ‘The Wouldbegoods are dead and gone
     But not the golden deeds they have done
     These will remain upon Glory’s page
     To be an example to every age,
     And by this we have got to know
     How to be good upon our ow--N.


N is for Noel, that makes the rhyme and the sense both right. O, W, N,
own; do you see?’

We saw it, and said so, and the gentle poet was satisfied. And the
council broke up. Oswald felt that a weight had been lifted from his
expanding chest, and it is curious that he never felt so inclined to be
good and a model youth as he did then. As he went down the ladder out of
the loft he said--

‘There’s one thing we ought to do, though, before we go home. We ought
to find Albert’s uncle’s long-lost grandmother for him.’

Alice’s heart beat true and steadfast. She said, ‘That’s just exactly
what Noel and I were saying this morning. Look out, Oswald, you wretch,
you’re kicking chaff into my eyes.’ She was going down the ladder just
under me.

Oswald’s younger sister’s thoughtful remark ended in another council.
But not in the straw loft. We decided to have a quite new place, and
disregarded H. O.’s idea of the dairy and Noel’s of the cellars. We had
the new council on the secret staircase, and there we settled exactly
what we ought to do. This is the same thing, if you really wish to be
good, as what you are going to do. It was a very interesting
council, and when it was over Oswald was so pleased to think that the
Wouldbegoods was unrecoverishly dead that he gave Denny and Noel, who
were sitting on the step below him, a good-humoured, playful, gentle,
loving, brotherly shove, and said, ‘Get along down, it’s tea-time!’

No reader who understands justice and the real rightness of things, and
who is to blame for what, will ever think it could have been Oswald’s
fault that the two other boys got along down by rolling over and over
each other, and bursting the door at the bottom of the stairs open by
their revolving bodies. And I should like to know whose fault it was
that Mrs Pettigrew was just on the other side of that door at that very
minute? The door burst open, and the impetuous bodies of Noel and Denny
rolled out of it into Mrs Pettigrew, and upset her and the tea-tray.
Both revolving boys were soaked with tea and milk, and there were one or
two cups and things smashed. Mrs Pettigrew was knocked over, but none of
her bones were broken. Noel and Denny were going to be sent to bed, but
Oswald said it was all his fault. He really did this to give the others
a chance of doing a refined golden deed by speaking the truth and saying
it was not his fault. But you cannot really count on anyone. They did
not say anything, but only rubbed the lumps on their late-revolving
heads. So it was bed for Oswald, and he felt the injustice hard.

But he sat up in bed and read The Last of the Mohicans, and then he
began to think. When Oswald really thinks he almost always thinks of
something. He thought of something now, and it was miles better than the
idea we had decided on in the secret staircase, of advertising in the
Kentish Mercury and saying if Albert’s uncle’s long-lost grandmother
would call at the Moat House she might hear of something much to her
advantage.

What Oswald thought of was that if we went to Hazelbridge and asked
Mr B. Munn, Grocer, that drove us home in the cart with the horse that
liked the wrong end of the whip best, he would know who the lady was
in the red hat and red wheels that paid him to drive us home that
Canterbury night. He must have been paid, of course, for even grocers
are not generous enough to drive perfect strangers, and five of
them too, about the country for nothing. Thus we may learn that even
unjustness and sending the wrong people to bed may bear useful fruit,
which ought to be a great comfort to everyone when they are unfairly
treated. Only it most likely won’t be. For if Oswald’s brothers and
sisters had nobly stood by him as he expected, he would not have had
the solitary reflections that led to the great scheme for finding the
grandmother.

Of course when the others came up to roost they all came and squatted
on Oswald’s bed and said how sorry they were. He waived their apologies
with noble dignity, because there wasn’t much time, and said he had an
idea that would knock the council’s plan into a cocked hat. But he would
not tell them what it was. He made them wait till next morning. This was
not sulks, but kind feeling. He wanted them to have something else to
think of besides the way they hadn’t stood by him in the bursting of the
secret staircase door and the tea-tray and the milk.

Next morning Oswald kindly explained, and asked who would volunteer for
a forced march to Hazelbridge. The word volunteer cost the young Oswald
a pang as soon as he had said it, but I hope he can bear pangs with any
man living. ‘And mind,’ he added, hiding the pang under a general-like
severeness, ‘I won’t have anyone in the expedition who has anything in
his shoes except his feet.’

This could not have been put more delicately and decently. But Oswald is
often misunderstood. Even Alice said it was unkind to throw the peas up
at Denny. When this little unpleasantness had passed away (it took some
time because Daisy cried, and Dora said, ‘There now, Oswald!’) there
were seven volunteers, which, with Oswald, made eight, and was, indeed,
all of us. There were no cockle-shells, or tape-sandals, or staves, or
scrips, or anything romantic and pious about the eight persons who set
out for Hazelbridge that morning, more earnestly wishful to be good and
deedful--at least Oswald, I know, was--than ever they had been in the
days of the beastly Wouldbegood Society. It was a fine day. Either it
was fine nearly all last summer, which is how Oswald remembers it, or
else nearly all the interesting things we did came on fine days.

With hearts light and gay, and no peas in anyone’s shoes, the walk to
Hazelbridge was perseveringly conducted. We took our lunch with us, and
the dear dogs. Afterwards we wished for a time that we had left one of
them at home. But they did so want to come, all of them, and Hazelbridge
is not nearly as far as Canterbury, really, so even Martha was allowed
to put on her things--I mean her collar--and come with us. She walks
slowly, but we had the day before us so there was no extra hurry.

At Hazelbridge we went into B. Munn’s grocer’s shop and asked for
ginger-beer to drink. They gave it us, but they seemed surprised at
us wanting to drink it there, and the glass was warm--it had just been
washed. We only did it, really, so as to get into conversation with B.
Munn, grocer, and extract information without rousing suspicion. You
cannot be too careful. However, when we had said it was first-class
ginger-beer, and paid for it, we found it not so easy to extract
anything more from B. Munn, grocer; and there was an anxious silence
while he fiddled about behind the counter among the tinned meats and
sauce bottles, with a fringe of hobnailed boots hanging over his head.

H. O. spoke suddenly. He is like the sort of person who rushes in where
angels fear to tread, as Denny says (say what sort of person that is).
He said--

‘I say, you remember driving us home that day. Who paid for the cart?’

Of course B. Munn, grocer, was not such a nincompoop (I like that word,
it means so many people I know) as to say right off. He said--

‘I was paid all right, young gentleman. Don’t you terrify yourself.’

People in Kent say terrify when they mean worry. So Dora shoved in a
gentle oar. She said--

‘We want to know the kind lady’s name and address, so that we can write
and thank her for being so jolly that day.’

B. Munn, grocer, muttered something about the lady’s address being goods
he was often asked for. Alice said, ‘But do tell us. We forgot to ask
her. She’s a relation of a second-hand uncle of ours, and I do so want
to thank her properly. And if you’ve got any extra-strong peppermints at
a penny an ounce, we should like a quarter of a pound.’

This was a master-stroke. While he was weighing out the peppermints his
heart got soft, and just as he was twisting up the corner of the paper
bag, Dora said, ‘What lovely fat peppermints! Do tell us.’

And B. Munn’s heart was now quite melted, he said--

‘It’s Miss Ashleigh, and she lives at The Cedars--about a mile down the
Maidstone Road.’

We thanked him, and Alice paid for the peppermints. Oswald was a little
anxious when she ordered such a lot, but she and Noel had got the money
all right, and when we were outside on Hazelbridge Green (a good deal
of it is gravel, really), we stood and looked at each other. Then Dora
said--

‘Let’s go home and write a beautiful letter and all sign it.’

Oswald looked at the others. Writing is all very well, but it’s such a
beastly long time to wait for anything to happen afterwards.

The intelligent Alice divined his thoughts, and the Dentist divined
hers--he is not clever enough yet to divine Oswald’s--and the two said
together--

‘Why not go and see her?’

‘She did say she would like to see us again some day,’ Dora replied. So
after we had argued a little about it we went.

And before we had gone a hundred yards down the dusty road Martha began
to make us wish with all our hearts we had not let her come. She began
to limp, just as a pilgrim, who I will not name, did when he had the
split peas in his silly palmering shoes.

So we called a halt and looked at her feet. One of them was quite
swollen and red. Bulldogs almost always have something the matter with
their feet, and it always comes on when least required. They are not the
right breed for emergencies.

There was nothing for it but to take it in turns to carry her. She is
very stout, and you have no idea how heavy she is. A half-hearted
unadventurous person (I name no names, but Oswald, Alice, Noel, H. O.,
Dicky, Daisy, and Denny will understand me) said, why not go straight
home and come another day without Martha? But the rest agreed with
Oswald when he said it was only a mile, and perhaps we might get a lift
home with the poor invalid. Martha was very grateful to us for our
kindness. She put her fat white arms round the person’s neck who
happened to be carrying her. She is very affectionate, but by holding
her very close to you you can keep her from kissing your face all the
time. As Alice said, ‘Bulldogs do give you such large, wet, pink
kisses.’

A mile is a good way when you have to take your turn at carrying Martha.

At last we came to a hedge with a ditch in front of it, and chains
swinging from posts to keep people off the grass and out of the ditch,
and a gate with ‘The Cedars’ on it in gold letters. All very neat and
tidy, and showing plainly that more than one gardener was kept. There we
stopped. Alice put Martha down, grunting with exhaustedness, and said--

‘Look here, Dora and Daisy, I don’t believe a bit that it’s his
grandmother. I’m sure Dora was right, and it’s only his horrid
sweetheart. I feel it in my bones. Now, don’t you really think we’d
better chuck it; we’re sure to catch it for interfering. We always do.’

‘The cross of true love never did come smooth,’ said the Dentist. ‘We
ought to help him to bear his cross.’

‘But if we find her for him, and she’s not his grandmother, he’ll MARRY
her,’ Dicky said in tones of gloominess and despair.

Oswald felt the same, but he said, ‘Never mind. We should all hate it,
but perhaps Albert’s uncle MIGHT like it. You can never tell. If you
want to do a really unselfish action and no kid, now’s your time, my
late Wouldbegoods.’

No one had the face to say right out that they didn’t want to be
unselfish.

But it was with sad hearts that the unselfish seekers opened the long
gate and went up the gravel drive between the rhododendrons and other
shrubberies towards the house.

I think I have explained to you before that the eldest son of anybody is
called the representative of the family if his father isn’t there. This
was why Oswald now took the lead. When we got to the last turn of the
drive it was settled that the others were to noiselessly ambush in the
rhododendrons, and Oswald was to go on alone and ask at the house for
the grandmother from India--I mean Miss Ashleigh.

So he did, but when he got to the front of the house and saw how neat
the flower-beds were with red geraniums, and the windows all bright and
speckless with muslin blinds and brass rods, and a green parrot in
a cage in the porch, and the doorstep newly whited, lying clean and
untrodden in the sunshine, he stood still and thought of his boots and
how dusty the roads were, and wished he had not gone into the farmyard
after eggs before starting that morning. As he stood there in anxious
uncertainness he heard a low voice among the bushes. It said, ‘Hist!
Oswald here!’ and it was the voice of Alice.

So he went back to the others among the shrubs and they all crowded
round their leader full of importable news.

‘She’s not in the house; she’s HERE,’ Alice said in a low whisper that
seemed nearly all S’s. ‘Close by--she went by just this minute with a
gentleman.’

‘And they’re sitting on a seat under a tree on a little lawn, and she’s
got her head on his shoulder, and he’s holding her hand. I never saw
anyone look so silly in all my born,’ Dicky said.

‘It’s sickening,’ Denny said, trying to look very manly with his legs
wide apart.

‘I don’t know,’ Oswald whispered. ‘I suppose it wasn’t Albert’s uncle?’

‘Not much,’ Dicky briefly replied.

‘Then don’t you see it’s all right. If she’s going on like that with
this fellow she’ll want to marry him, and Albert’s uncle is safe. And
we’ve really done an unselfish action without having to suffer for it
afterwards.’

With a stealthy movement Oswald rubbed his hands as he spoke in real
joyfulness. We decided that we had better bunk unnoticed. But we had
reckoned without Martha. She had strolled off limping to look about her
a bit in the shrubbery. ‘Where’s Martha?’ Dora suddenly said.

‘She went that way,’ pointingly remarked H. O.

‘Then fetch her back, you young duffer! What did you let her go for?’
Oswald said. ‘And look sharp. Don’t make a row.’

He went. A minute later we heard a hoarse squeak from Martha--the one
she always gives when suddenly collared from behind--and a little squeal
in a lady-like voice, and a man say ‘Hallo!’ and then we knew that H. O.
had once more rushed in where angels might have thought twice about it.
We hurried to the fatal spot, but it was too late. We were just in time
to hear H. O. say--

‘I’m sorry if she frightened you. But we’ve been looking for you. Are
you Albert’s uncle’s long-lost grandmother?’

‘NO,’ said our lady unhesitatingly.

It seemed vain to add seven more agitated actors to the scene now going
on. We stood still. The man was standing up. He was a clergyman, and I
found out afterwards he was the nicest we ever knew except our own Mr
Briston at Lewisham, who is now a canon or a dean, or something grand
that no one ever sees. At present I did not like him. He said, ‘No, this
lady is nobody’s grandmother. May I ask in return how long it is since
you escaped from the lunatic asylum, my poor child, and whence your
keeper is?’

H. O. took no notice of this at all, except to say, ‘I think you are
very rude, and not at all funny, if you think you are.’

The lady said, ‘My dear, I remember you now perfectly. How are all the
others, and are you pilgrims again to-day?’

H. O. does not always answer questions. He turned to the man and said--

‘Are you going to marry the lady?’

‘Margaret,’ said the clergyman, ‘I never thought it would come to this:
he asks me my intentions.’

‘If you ARE,’ said H. O., ‘it’s all right, because if you do Albert’s
uncle can’t--at least, not till you’re dead. And we don’t want him to.’

‘Flattering, upon my word,’ said the clergyman, putting on a deep frown.
‘Shall I call him out, Margaret, for his poor opinion of you, or shall I
send for the police?’

Alice now saw that H. O., though firm, was getting muddled and rather
scared. She broke cover and sprang into the middle of the scene.

‘Don’t let him rag H. O. any more,’ she said, ‘it’s all our faults. You
see, Albert’s uncle was so anxious to find you, we thought perhaps you
were his long-lost heiress sister or his old nurse who alone knew the
secret of his birth, or something, and we asked him, and he said you
were his long-lost grandmother he had known in India. And we thought
that must be a mistake and that really you were his long-lost
sweetheart. And we tried to do a really unselfish act and find you for
him. Because we don’t want him to be married at all.’

‘It isn’t because we don’t like YOU,’ Oswald cut in, now emerging from
the bushes, ‘and if he must marry, we’d sooner it was you than anyone.
Really we would.’

‘A generous concession, Margaret,’ the strange clergyman uttered, ‘most
generous, but the plot thickens. It’s almost pea-soup-like now. One or
two points clamour for explanation. Who are these visitors of yours? Why
this Red Indian method of paying morning calls? Why the lurking attitude
of the rest of the tribe which I now discern among the undergrowth?
Won’t you ask the rest of the tribe to come out and join the glad
throng?’

Then I liked him better. I always like people who know the same songs we
do, and books and tunes and things.

The others came out. The lady looked very uncomfy, and partly as if she
was going to cry. But she couldn’t help laughing too, as more and more
of us came out.

‘And who,’ the clergyman went on, ‘who in fortune’s name is Albert? And
who is his uncle? And what have they or you to do in this galere--I mean
garden?’

We all felt rather silly, and I don’t think I ever felt more than then
what an awful lot there were of us.

‘Three years’ absence in Calcutta or elsewhere may explain my ignorance
of these details, but still--’

‘I think we’d better go,’ said Dora. ‘I’m sorry if we’ve done anything
rude or wrong. We didn’t mean to. Good-bye. I hope you’ll be happy with
the gentleman, I’m sure.’

‘I HOPE so too,’ said Noel, and I know he was thinking how much nicer
Albert’s uncle was. We turned to go. The lady had been very silent
compared with what she was when she pretended to show us Canterbury. But
now she seemed to shake off some dreamy silliness, and caught hold of
Dora by the shoulder.

‘No, dear, no,’ she said, ‘it’s all right, and you must have some
tea--we’ll have it on the lawn. John, don’t tease them any more.
Albert’s uncle is the gentleman I told you about. And, my dear children,
this is my brother that I haven’t seen for three years.’

‘Then he’s a long-lost too,’ said H. O.

The lady said ‘Not now’ and smiled at him.

And the rest of us were dumb with confounding emotions. Oswald was
particularly dumb. He might have known it was her brother, because in
rotten grown-up books if a girl kisses a man in a shrubbery that is
not the man you think she’s in love with; it always turns out to be
a brother, though generally the disgrace of the family and not a
respectable chaplain from Calcutta.

The lady now turned to her reverend and surprising brother and said,
‘John, go and tell them we’ll have tea on the lawn.’

When he was gone she stood quite still a minute. Then she said, ‘I’m
going to tell you something, but I want to put you on your honour not
to talk about it to other people. You see it isn’t everyone I would tell
about it. He, Albert’s uncle, I mean, has told me a lot about you, and I
know I can trust you.’

We said ‘Yes’, Oswald with a brooding sentiment of knowing all too well
what was coming next.

The lady then said, ‘Though I am not Albert’s uncle’s grandmother I
did know him in India once, and we were going to be married, but we had
a--a--misunderstanding.’

‘Quarrel?’ Row?’ said Noel and H. O. at once.

‘Well, yes, a quarrel, and he went away. He was in the Navy then. And
then... well, we were both sorry, but well, anyway, when his ship came
back we’d gone to Constantinople, then to England, and he couldn’t find
us. And he says he’s been looking for me ever since.’

‘Not you for him?’ said Noel.

‘Well, perhaps,’ said the lady.

And the girls said ‘Ah!’ with deep interest. The lady went on more
quickly, ‘And then I found you, and then he found me, and now I must
break it to you. Try to bear up.’

She stopped. The branches cracked, and Albert’s uncle was in our midst.
He took off his hat. ‘Excuse my tearing my hair,’ he said to the lady,
‘but has the pack really hunted you down?’

‘It’s all right,’ she said, and when she looked at him she got miles
prettier quite suddenly. ‘I was just breaking to them...’

‘Don’t take that proud privilege from me,’ he said. ‘Kiddies, allow
me to present you to the future Mrs Albert’s uncle, or shall we say
Albert’s new aunt?’

                         *    *    *
There was a good deal of explaining done before tea--about how we got
there, I mean, and why. But after the first bitterness of disappointment
we felt not nearly so sorry as we had expected to. For Albert’s uncle’s
lady was very jolly to us, and her brother was awfully decent, and
showed us a lot of first-class native curiosities and things, unpacking
them on purpose; skins of beasts, and beads, and brass things, and
shells from different savage lands besides India. And the lady told the
girls that she hoped they would like her as much as she liked them, and
if they wanted a new aunt she would do her best to give satisfaction in
the new situation. And Alice thought of the Murdstone aunt belonging to
Daisy and Denny, and how awful it would have been if Albert’s uncle
had married HER. And she decided, she told me afterwards, that we might
think ourselves jolly lucky it was no worse.

Then the lady led Oswald aside, pretending to show him the parrot which
he had explored thoroughly before, and told him she was not like some
people in books. When she was married she would never try to separate
her husband from his bachelor friends, she only wanted them to be her
friends as well.

Then there was tea, and thus all ended in amicableness, and the reverend
and friendly drove us home in a wagonette. But for Martha we shouldn’t
have had tea, or explanations, or lift or anything. So we honoured her,
and did not mind her being so heavy and walking up and down constantly
on our laps as we drove home.


And that is all the story of the long-lost grandmother and Albert’s
uncle. I am afraid it is rather dull, but it was very important (to
him), so I felt it ought to be narrated. Stories about lovers and
getting married are generally slow. I like a love-story where the hero
parts with the girl at the garden-gate in the gloaming and goes off and
has adventures, and you don’t see her any more till he comes home to
marry her at the end of the book. And I suppose people have to marry.
Albert’s uncle is awfully old--more than thirty, and the lady is
advanced in years--twenty-six next Christmas. They are to be married
then. The girls are to be bridesmaids in white frocks with fur. This
quite consoles them. If Oswald repines sometimes, he hides it. What’s
the use? We all have to meet our fell destiny, and Albert’s uncle is not
extirpated from this awful law.

Now the finding of the long-lost was the very last thing we did for the
sake of its being a noble act, so that is the end of the Wouldbegoods,
and there are no more chapters after this. But Oswald hates books that
finish up without telling you the things you might want to know about
the people in the book. So here goes.

We went home to the beautiful Blackheath house. It seemed very stately
and mansion-like after the Moat House, and everyone was most frightfully
pleased to see us.

Mrs Pettigrew CRIED when we went away. I never was so astonished in my
life. She made each of the girls a fat red pincushion like a heart,
and each of us boys had a knife bought out of the housekeeping (I mean
housekeeper’s own) money.

Bill Simpkins is happy as sub-under-gardener to Albert’s uncle’s lady’s
mother. They do keep three gardeners--I knew they did. And our tramp
still earns enough to sleep well on from our dear old Pig-man.

Our last three days were entirely filled up with visits of farewell
sympathy to all our many friends who were so sorry to lose us. We
promised to come and see them next year. I hope we shall.

Denny and Daisy went back to live with their father at Forest Hill. I
don’t think they’ll ever be again the victims of the Murdstone aunt--who
is really a great-aunt and about twice as much in the autumn of her days
as our new Albert’s-uncle aunt. I think they plucked up spirit enough
to tell their father they didn’t like her--which they’d never thought of
doing before. Our own robber says their holidays in the country did
them both a great deal of good. And he says us Bastables have certainly
taught Daisy and Denny the rudiments of the art of making home happy. I
believe they have thought of several quite new naughty things entirely
on their own--and done them too--since they came back from the Moat
House.

I wish you didn’t grow up so quickly. Oswald can see that ere long he
will be too old for the kind of games we can all play, and he feels
grown-upness creeping inordiously upon him. But enough of this.

And now, gentle reader, farewell. If anything in these chronicles of the
Wouldbegoods should make you try to be good yourself, the author will
be very glad, of course. But take my advice and don’t make a society for
trying in. It is much easier without.

And do try to forget that Oswald has another name besides Bastable. The
one beginning with C., I mean. Perhaps you have not noticed what it was.
If so, don’t look back for it. It is a name no manly boy would like to
be called by--if he spoke the truth. Oswald is said to be a very manly
boy, and he despises that name, and will never give it to his own son
when he has one. Not if a rich relative offered to leave him an immense
fortune if he did. Oswald would still be firm. He would, on the honour
of the House of Bastable.

CHAPTER 1. THE COUNCIL OF WAYS AND MEANS

This is the story of the different ways we looked for treasure, and I
think when you have read it you will see that we were not lazy about the
looking.

There are some things I must tell before I begin to tell about the
treasure-seeking, because I have read books myself, and I know how
beastly it is when a story begins, “‘Alas!” said Hildegarde with a deep
sigh, “we must look our last on this ancestral home”’--and then some one
else says something--and you don’t know for pages and pages where the
home is, or who Hildegarde is, or anything about it. Our ancestral home
is in the Lewisham Road. It is semi-detached and has a garden, not a
large one. We are the Bastables. There are six of us besides Father. Our
Mother is dead, and if you think we don’t care because I don’t tell you
much about her you only show that you do not understand people at all.
Dora is the eldest. Then Oswald--and then Dicky. Oswald won the Latin
prize at his preparatory school--and Dicky is good at sums. Alice
and Noel are twins: they are ten, and Horace Octavius is my youngest
brother. It is one of us that tells this story--but I shall not tell you
which: only at the very end perhaps I will. While the story is going
on you may be trying to guess, only I bet you don’t. It was Oswald
who first thought of looking for treasure. Oswald often thinks of very
interesting things. And directly he thought of it he did not keep it
to himself, as some boys would have done, but he told the others, and
said--

‘I’ll tell you what, we must go and seek for treasure: it is always what
you do to restore the fallen fortunes of your House.’

Dora said it was all very well. She often says that. She was trying to
mend a large hole in one of Noel’s stockings. He tore it on a nail when
we were playing shipwrecked mariners on top of the chicken-house the day
H. O. fell off and cut his chin: he has the scar still. Dora is the only
one of us who ever tries to mend anything. Alice tries to make things
sometimes. Once she knitted a red scarf for Noel because his chest
is delicate, but it was much wider at one end than the other, and he
wouldn’t wear it. So we used it as a pennon, and it did very well,
because most of our things are black or grey since Mother died; and
scarlet was a nice change. Father does not like you to ask for new
things. That was one way we had of knowing that the fortunes of the
ancient House of Bastable were really fallen. Another way was that there
was no more pocket-money--except a penny now and then to the little
ones, and people did not come to dinner any more, like they used to,
with pretty dresses, driving up in cabs--and the carpets got holes in
them--and when the legs came off things they were not sent to be mended,
and we gave _up_ having the gardener except for the front garden, and
not that very often. And the silver in the big oak plate-chest that is
lined with green baize all went away to the shop to have the dents
and scratches taken out of it, and it never came back. We think Father
hadn’t enough money to pay the silver man for taking out the dents and
scratches. The new spoons and forks were yellowy-white, and not so heavy
as the old ones, and they never shone after the first day or two.

Father was very ill after Mother died; and while he was ill his
business-partner went to Spain--and there was never much money
afterwards. I don’t know why. Then the servants left and there was only
one, a General. A great deal of your comfort and happiness depends on
having a good General. The last but one was nice: she used to make jolly
good currant puddings for us, and let us have the dish on the floor
and pretend it was a wild boar we were killing with our forks. But the
General we have now nearly always makes sago puddings, and they are
the watery kind, and you cannot pretend anything with them, not even
islands, like you do with porridge.

Then we left off going to school, and Father said we should go to a good
school as soon as he could manage it. He said a holiday would do us all
good. We thought he was right, but we wished he had told us he couldn’t
afford it. For of course we knew.

Then a great many people used to come to the door with envelopes with
no stamps on them, and sometimes they got very angry, and said they
were calling for the last time before putting it in other hands. I asked
Eliza what that meant, and she kindly explained to me, and I was so
sorry for Father.

And once a long, blue paper came; a policeman brought it, and we were
so frightened. But Father said it was all right, only when he went up
to kiss the girls after they were in bed they said he had been crying,
though I’m sure that’s not true. Because only cowards and snivellers
cry, and my Father is the bravest man in the world.

So you see it was time we looked for treasure and Oswald said so, and
Dora said it was all very well. But the others agreed with Oswald. So we
held a council. Dora was in the chair--the big dining-room chair, that
we let the fireworks off from, the Fifth of November when we had the
measles and couldn’t do it in the garden. The hole has never been
mended, so now we have that chair in the nursery, and I think it was
cheap at the blowing-up we boys got when the hole was burnt.

‘We must do something,’ said Alice, ‘because the exchequer is empty.’
She rattled the money-box as she spoke, and it really did rattle because
we always keep the bad sixpence in it for luck.

‘Yes--but what shall we do?’ said Dicky. ‘It’s so jolly easy to say
let’s do _something_.’ Dicky always wants everything settled exactly.
Father calls him the Definite Article.

‘Let’s read all the books again. We shall get lots of ideas out of
them.’ It was Noel who suggested this, but we made him shut up, because
we knew well enough he only wanted to get back to his old books. Noel
is a poet. He sold some of his poetry once--and it was printed, but that
does not come in this part of the story.

Then Dicky said, ‘Look here. We’ll be quite quiet for ten minutes by
the clock--and each think of some way to find treasure. And when we’ve
thought we’ll try all the ways one after the other, beginning with the
eldest.’

‘I shan’t be able to think in ten minutes, make it half an hour,’ said
H. O. His real name is Horace Octavius, but we call him H. O. because of
the advertisement, and it’s not so very long ago he was afraid to pass
the hoarding where it says ‘Eat H. O.’ in big letters. He says it was
when he was a little boy, but I remember last Christmas but one, he woke
in the middle of the night crying and howling, and they said it was the
pudding. But he told me afterwards he had been dreaming that they really
_had_ come to eat H. O., and it couldn’t have been the pudding, when you
come to think of it, because it was so very plain.

Well, we made it half an hour--and we all sat quiet, and thought and
thought. And I made up my mind before two minutes were over, and I
saw the others had, all but Dora, who is always an awful time over
everything. I got pins and needles in my leg from sitting still so long,
and when it was seven minutes H. O. cried out--‘Oh, it must be more than
half an hour!’

H. O. is eight years old, but he cannot tell the clock yet. Oswald could
tell the clock when he was six.

We all stretched ourselves and began to speak at once, but Dora put up
her hands to her ears and said--

‘One at a time, please. We aren’t playing Babel.’ (It is a very good
game. Did you ever play it?)

So Dora made us all sit in a row on the floor, in ages, and then she
pointed at us with the finger that had the brass thimble on. Her silver
one got lost when the last General but two went away. We think she must
have forgotten it was Dora’s and put it in her box by mistake. She was a
very forgetful girl. She used to forget what she had spent money on, so
that the change was never quite right.

Oswald spoke first. ‘I think we might stop people on Blackheath--with
crape masks and horse-pistols--and say “Your money or your life!
Resistance is useless, we are armed to the teeth”--like Dick Turpin
and Claude Duval. It wouldn’t matter about not having horses, because
coaches have gone out too.’

Dora screwed up her nose the way she always does when she is going to
talk like the good elder sister in books, and said, ‘That would be
very wrong: it’s like pickpocketing or taking pennies out of Father’s
great-coat when it’s hanging in the hall.’

I must say I don’t think she need have said that, especially before the
little ones--for it was when I was only four.

But Oswald was not going to let her see he cared, so he said--

‘Oh, very well. I can think of lots of other ways. We could rescue an
old gentleman from deadly Highwaymen.’

‘There aren’t any,’ said Dora.

‘Oh, well, it’s all the same--from deadly peril, then. There’s plenty
of that. Then he would turn out to be the Prince of Wales, and he would
say, “My noble, my cherished preserver! Here is a million pounds a year.
Rise up, Sir Oswald Bastable.”’

But the others did not seem to think so, and it was Alice’s turn to say.

She said, ‘I think we might try the divining-rod. I’m sure I could do
it. I’ve often read about it. You hold a stick in your hands, and when
you come to where there is gold underneath the stick kicks about. So you
know. And you dig.’

‘Oh,’ said Dora suddenly, ‘I have an idea. But I’ll say last. I hope the
divining-rod isn’t wrong. I believe it’s wrong in the Bible.’

‘So is eating pork and ducks,’ said Dicky. ‘You can’t go by that.’

‘Anyhow, we’ll try the other ways first,’ said Dora. ‘Now, H. O.’

‘Let’s be Bandits,’ said H. O. ‘I dare say it’s wrong but it would be
fun pretending.’

‘I’m sure it’s wrong,’ said Dora.

And Dicky said she thought everything wrong. She said she didn’t, and
Dicky was very disagreeable. So Oswald had to make peace, and he said--

‘Dora needn’t play if she doesn’t want to. Nobody asked her. And, Dicky,
don’t be an idiot: do dry up and let’s hear what Noel’s idea is.’

Dora and Dicky did not look pleased, but I kicked Noel under the table
to make him hurry up, and then he said he didn’t think he wanted to
play any more. That’s the worst of it. The others are so jolly ready to
quarrel. I told Noel to be a man and not a snivelling pig, and at last
he said he had not made up his mind whether he would print his poetry in
a book and sell it, or find a princess and marry her.

‘Whichever it is,’ he added, ‘none of you shall want for anything,
though Oswald did kick me, and say I was a snivelling pig.’

‘I didn’t,’ said Oswald, ‘I told you not to be.’ And Alice explained to
him that that was quite the opposite of what he thought. So he agreed to
drop it.

Then Dicky spoke.

‘You must all of you have noticed the advertisements in the papers,
telling you that ladies and gentlemen can easily earn two pounds a
week in their spare time, and to send two shillings for sample and
instructions, carefully packed free from observation. Now that we don’t
go to school all our time is spare time. So I should think we could
easily earn twenty pounds a week each. That would do us very well. We’ll
try some of the other things first, and directly we have any money we’ll
send for the sample and instructions. And I have another idea, but I
must think about it before I say.’

We all said, ‘Out with it--what’s the other idea?’

But Dicky said, ‘No.’ That is Dicky all over. He never will show you
anything he’s making till it’s quite finished, and the same with his
inmost thoughts. But he is pleased if you seem to want to know, so
Oswald said--

‘Keep your silly old secret, then. Now, Dora, drive ahead. We’ve all
said except you.’

Then Dora jumped up and dropped the stocking and the thimble (it rolled
away, and we did not find it for days), and said--

‘Let’s try my way _now_. Besides, I’m the eldest, so it’s only fair.
Let’s dig for treasure. Not any tiresome divining-rod--but just plain
digging. People who dig for treasure always find it. And then we shall
be rich and we needn’t try your ways at all. Some of them are rather
difficult: and I’m certain some of them are wrong--and we must always
remember that wrong things--’

But we told her to shut up and come on, and she did.

I couldn’t help wondering as we went down to the garden, why Father
had never thought of digging there for treasure instead of going to his
beastly office every day.



CHAPTER 2. DIGGING FOR TREASURE

I am afraid the last chapter was rather dull. It is always dull in books
when people talk and talk, and don’t do anything, but I was obliged to
put it in, or else you wouldn’t have understood all the rest. The best
part of books is when things are happening. That is the best part of
real things too. This is why I shall not tell you in this story about
all the days when nothing happened. You will not catch me saying, ‘thus
the sad days passed slowly by’--or ‘the years rolled on their weary
course’--or ‘time went on’--because it is silly; of course time goes
on--whether you say so or not. So I shall just tell you the nice,
interesting parts--and in between you will understand that we had our
meals and got up and went to bed, and dull things like that. It would be
sickening to write all that down, though of course it happens. I said
so to Albert-next-door’s uncle, who writes books, and he said, ‘Quite
right, that’s what we call selection, a necessity of true art.’ And he
is very clever indeed. So you see.

I have often thought that if the people who write books for children
knew a little more it would be better. I shall not tell you anything
about us except what I should like to know about if I was reading the
story and you were writing it. Albert’s uncle says I ought to have put
this in the preface, but I never read prefaces, and it is not much good
writing things just for people to skip. I wonder other authors have
never thought of this.

Well, when we had agreed to dig for treasure we all went down into the
cellar and lighted the gas. Oswald would have liked to dig there, but
it is stone flags. We looked among the old boxes and broken chairs and
fenders and empty bottles and things, and at last we found the spades we
had to dig in the sand with when we went to the seaside three years ago.
They are not silly, babyish, wooden spades, that split if you look at
them, but good iron, with a blue mark across the top of the iron part,
and yellow wooden handles. We wasted a little time getting them dusted,
because the girls wouldn’t dig with spades that had cobwebs on them.
Girls would never do for African explorers or anything like that, they
are too beastly particular.

It was no use doing the thing by halves. We marked out a sort of square
in the mouldy part of the garden, about three yards across, and began
to dig. But we found nothing except worms and stones--and the ground was
very hard.

So we thought we’d try another part of the garden, and we found a
place in the big round flower bed, where the ground was much softer. We
thought we’d make a smaller hole to begin with, and it was much better.
We dug and dug and dug, and it was jolly hard work! We got very hot
digging, but we found nothing.

Presently Albert-next-door looked over the wall. We do not like him very
much, but we let him play with us sometimes, because his father is dead,
and you must not be unkind to orphans, even if their mothers are
alive. Albert is always very tidy. He wears frilly collars and velvet
knickerbockers. I can’t think how he can bear to.

So we said, ‘Hallo!’

And he said, ‘What are you up to?’

‘We’re digging for treasure,’ said Alice; ‘an ancient parchment revealed
to us the place of concealment. Come over and help us. When we have
dug deep enough we shall find a great pot of red clay, full of gold and
precious jewels.’

Albert-next-door only sniggered and said, ‘What silly nonsense!’ He
cannot play properly at all. It is very strange, because he has a very
nice uncle. You see, Albert-next-door doesn’t care for reading, and he
has not read nearly so many books as we have, so he is very foolish and
ignorant, but it cannot be helped, and you just have to put up with it
when you want him to do anything. Besides, it is wrong to be angry with
people for not being so clever as you are yourself. It is not always
their faults.

So Oswald said, ‘Come and dig! Then you shall share the treasure when
we’ve found it.’

But he said, ‘I shan’t--I don’t like digging--and I’m just going in to
my tea.’

‘Come along and dig, there’s a good boy,’ Alice said. ‘You can use my
spade. It’s much the best--’

So he came along and dug, and when once he was over the wall we kept him
at it, and we worked as well, of course, and the hole got deep. Pincher
worked too--he is our dog and he is very good at digging. He digs for
rats in the dustbin sometimes, and gets very dirty. But we love our dog,
even when his face wants washing.

‘I expect we shall have to make a tunnel,’ Oswald said, ‘to reach the
rich treasure.’ So he jumped into the hole and began to dig at one side.
After that we took it in turns to dig at the tunnel, and Pincher was
most useful in scraping the earth out of the tunnel--he does it with
his back feet when you say ‘Rats!’ and he digs with his front ones, and
burrows with his nose as well.

At last the tunnel was nearly a yard long, and big enough to creep
along to find the treasure, if only it had been a bit longer. Now it was
Albert’s turn to go in and dig, but he funked it.

‘Take your turn like a man,’ said Oswald--nobody can say that Oswald
doesn’t take his turn like a man. But Albert wouldn’t. So we had to make
him, because it was only fair.

‘It’s quite easy,’ Alice said. ‘You just crawl in and dig with your
hands. Then when you come out we can scrape out what you’ve done, with
the spades. Come--be a man. You won’t notice it being dark in the tunnel
if you shut your eyes tight. We’ve all been in except Dora--and she
doesn’t like worms.’

‘I don’t like worms neither.’ Albert-next-door said this; but we
remembered how he had picked a fat red and black worm up in his fingers
and thrown it at Dora only the day before. So we put him in.

But he would not go in head first, the proper way, and dig with his
hands as we had done, and though Oswald was angry at the time, for he
hates snivellers, yet afterwards he owned that perhaps it was just
as well. You should never be afraid to own that perhaps you were
mistaken--but it is cowardly to do it unless you are quite sure you are
in the wrong.

‘Let me go in feet first,’ said Albert-next-door. ‘I’ll dig with my
boots--I will truly, honour bright.’

So we let him get in feet first--and he did it very slowly and at last
he was in, and only his head sticking out into the hole; and all the
rest of him in the tunnel.

‘Now dig with your boots,’ said Oswald; ‘and, Alice, do catch hold of
Pincher, he’ll be digging again in another minute, and perhaps it would
be uncomfortable for Albert if Pincher threw the mould into his eyes.’

You should always try to think of these little things. Thinking of other
people’s comfort makes them like you. Alice held Pincher, and we all
shouted, ‘Kick! dig with your feet, for all you’re worth!’

So Albert-next-door began to dig with his feet, and we stood on the
ground over him, waiting--and all in a minute the ground gave way, and
we tumbled together in a heap: and when we got up there was a little
shallow hollow where we had been standing, and Albert-next-door was
underneath, stuck quite fast, because the roof of the tunnel had tumbled
in on him. He is a horribly unlucky boy to have anything to do with.

It was dreadful the way he cried and screamed, though he had to own it
didn’t hurt, only it was rather heavy and he couldn’t move his legs. We
would have dug him out all right enough, in time, but he screamed so we
were afraid the police would come, so Dicky climbed over the wall, to
tell the cook there to tell Albert-next-door’s uncle he had been buried
by mistake, and to come and help dig him out.

Dicky was a long time gone. We wondered what had become of him, and all
the while the screaming went on and on, for we had taken the loose earth
off Albert’s face so that he could scream quite easily and comfortably.

Presently Dicky came back and Albert-next-door’s uncle came with him. He
has very long legs, and his hair is light and his face is brown. He has
been to sea, but now he writes books. I like him.

He told his nephew to stow it, so Albert did, and then he asked him if
he was hurt--and Albert had to say he wasn’t, for though he is a coward,
and very unlucky, he is not a liar like some boys are.

‘This promises to be a protracted if agreeable task,’ said
Albert-next-door’s uncle, rubbing his hands and looking at the hole with
Albert’s head in it. ‘I will get another spade,’ so he fetched the big
spade out of the next-door garden tool-shed, and began to dig his nephew
out.

‘Mind you keep very still,’ he said, ‘or I might chunk a bit out of you
with the spade.’ Then after a while he said--

‘I confess that I am not absolutely insensible to the dramatic interest
of the situation. My curiosity is excited. I own that I should like to
know how my nephew happened to be buried. But don’t tell me if you’d
rather not. I suppose no force was used?’

‘Only moral force,’ said Alice. They used to talk a lot about moral
force at the High School where she went, and in case you don’t know what
it means I’ll tell you that it is making people do what they don’t want
to, just by slanging them, or laughing at them, or promising them things
if they’re good.

‘Only moral force, eh?’ said Albert-next-door’s uncle. ‘Well?’

‘Well,’ Dora said, ‘I’m very sorry it happened to Albert--I’d rather it
had been one of us. It would have been my turn to go into the tunnel,
only I don’t like worms, so they let me off. You see we were digging for
treasure.’

‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘and I think we were just coming to the underground
passage that leads to the secret hoard, when the tunnel fell in on
Albert. He _is_ so unlucky,’ and she sighed.

Then Albert-next-door began to scream again, and his uncle wiped his
face--his own face, not Albert’s--with his silk handkerchief, and then
he put it in his trousers pocket. It seems a strange place to put a
handkerchief, but he had his coat and waistcoat off and I suppose he
wanted the handkerchief handy. Digging is warm work.

He told Albert-next-door to drop it, or he wouldn’t proceed further
in the matter, so Albert stopped screaming, and presently his uncle
finished digging him out. Albert did look so funny, with his hair all
dusty and his velvet suit covered with mould and his face muddy with
earth and crying.

We all said how sorry we were, but he wouldn’t say a word back to us. He
was most awfully sick to think he’d been the one buried, when it might
just as well have been one of us. I felt myself that it was hard lines.

‘So you were digging for treasure,’ said Albert-next-door’s uncle,
wiping his face again with his handkerchief. ‘Well, I fear that your
chances of success are small. I have made a careful study of the whole
subject. What I don’t know about buried treasure is not worth knowing.
And I never knew more than one coin buried in any one garden--and that
is generally--Hullo--what’s that?’

He pointed to something shining in the hole he had just dragged Albert
out of. Oswald picked it up. It was a half-crown. We looked at each
other, speechless with surprise and delight, like in books.

‘Well, that’s lucky, at all events,’ said Albert-next-door’s uncle.

‘Let’s see, that’s fivepence each for you.’

‘It’s fourpence--something; I can’t do fractions,’ said Dicky; ‘there
are seven of us, you see.’

‘Oh, you count Albert as one of yourselves on this occasion, eh?’

‘Of course,’ said Alice; ‘and I say, he was buried after all. Why
shouldn’t we let him have the odd somethings, and we’ll have fourpence
each.’

We all agreed to do this, and told Albert-next-door we would bring his
share as soon as we could get the half-crown changed. He cheered up a
little at that, and his uncle wiped his face again--he did look hot--and
began to put on his coat and waistcoat.

When he had done it he stooped and picked up something. He held it up,
and you will hardly believe it, but it is quite true--it was another
half-crown!

‘To think that there should be two!’ he said; ‘in all my experience of
buried treasure I never heard of such a thing!’

I wish Albert-next-door’s uncle would come treasure-seeking with us
regularly; he must have very sharp eyes: for Dora says she was looking
just the minute before at the very place where the second half-crown was
picked up from, and _she_ never saw it.



CHAPTER 3. BEING DETECTIVES

The next thing that happened to us was very interesting. It was as real
as the half-crowns--not just pretending. I shall try to write it as like
a real book as I can. Of course we have read Mr Sherlock Holmes, as
well as the yellow-covered books with pictures outside that are so badly
printed; and you get them for fourpence-halfpenny at the bookstall when
the corners of them are beginning to curl up and get dirty, with people
looking to see how the story ends when they are waiting for trains. I
think this is most unfair to the boy at the bookstall. The books are
written by a gentleman named Gaboriau, and Albert’s uncle says they are
the worst translations in the world--and written in vile English. Of
course they’re not like Kipling, but they’re jolly good stories. And we
had just been reading a book by Dick Diddlington--that’s not his right
name, but I know all about libel actions, so I shall not say what his
name is really, because his books are rot. Only they put it into our
heads to do what I am going to narrate.

It was in September, and we were not to go to the seaside because it is
so expensive, even if you go to Sheerness, where it is all tin cans and
old boots and no sand at all. But every one else went, even the people
next door--not Albert’s side, but the other. Their servant told Eliza
they were all going to Scarborough, and next day sure enough all the
blinds were down and the shutters up, and the milk was not left any
more. There is a big horse-chestnut tree between their garden and ours,
very useful for getting conkers out of and for making stuff to rub on
your chilblains. This prevented our seeing whether the blinds were
down at the back as well, but Dicky climbed to the top of the tree and
looked, and they were.

It was jolly hot weather, and very stuffy indoors--we used to play a
good deal in the garden. We made a tent out of the kitchen clothes-horse
and some blankets off our beds, and though it was quite as hot in the
tent as in the house it was a very different sort of hotness. Albert’s
uncle called it the Turkish Bath. It is not nice to be kept from the
seaside, but we know that we have much to be thankful for. We might be
poor little children living in a crowded alley where even at summer
noon hardly a ray of sunlight penetrates; clothed in rags and with bare
feet--though I do not mind holes in my clothes myself, and bare
feet would not be at all bad in this sort of weather. Indeed we do,
sometimes, when we are playing at things which require it. It was
shipwrecked mariners that day, I remember, and we were all in the
blanket tent. We had just finished eating the things we had saved, at
the peril of our lives, from the st-sinking vessel. They were rather
nice things. Two-pennyworth of coconut candy--it was got in Greenwich,
where it is four ounces a penny--three apples, some macaroni--the
straight sort that is so useful to suck things through--some raw rice,
and a large piece of cold suet pudding that Alice nicked from the larder
when she went to get the rice and macaroni. And when we had finished
some one said--

‘I should like to be a detective.’

I wish to be quite fair, but I cannot remember exactly who said it.
Oswald thinks he said it, and Dora says it was Dicky, but Oswald is too
much of a man to quarrel about a little thing like that.

‘I should like to be a detective,’ said--perhaps it was Dicky, but I
think not--‘and find out strange and hidden crimes.’

‘You have to be much cleverer than you are,’ said H. O.

‘Not so very,’ Alice said, ‘because when you’ve read the books you know
what the things mean: the red hair on the handle of the knife, or the
grains of white powder on the velvet collar of the villain’s overcoat. I
believe we could do it.’

‘I shouldn’t like to have anything to do with murders,’ said Dora;
‘somehow it doesn’t seem safe--’

‘And it always ends in the poor murderer being hanged,’ said Alice.

We explained to her why murderers have to be hanged, but she only said,
‘I don’t care. I’m sure no one would ever do murdering _twice_. Think
of the blood and things, and what you would see when you woke up in the
night! I shouldn’t mind being a detective to lie in wait for a gang
of coiners, now, and spring upon them unawares, and secure
them--single-handed, you know, or with only my faithful bloodhound.’

She stroked Pincher’s ears, but he had gone to sleep because he knew
well enough that all the suet pudding was finished. He is a very
sensible dog. ‘You always get hold of the wrong end of the stick,’
Oswald said. ‘You can’t choose what crimes you’ll be a detective about.
You just have to get a suspicious circumstance, and then you look for a
clue and follow it up. Whether it turns out a murder or a missing will
is just a fluke.’

‘That’s one way,’ Dicky said. ‘Another is to get a paper and find
two advertisements or bits of news that fit. Like this: “Young Lady
Missing,” and then it tells about all the clothes she had on, and the
gold locket she wore, and the colour of her hair, and all that; and then
in another piece of the paper you see, “Gold locket found,” and then it
all comes out.’

We sent H. O. for the paper at once, but we could not make any of the
things fit in. The two best were about how some burglars broke into
a place in Holloway where they made preserved tongues and invalid
delicacies, and carried off a lot of them. And on another page there
was, ‘Mysterious deaths in Holloway.’

Oswald thought there was something in it, and so did Albert’s uncle when
we asked him, but the others thought not, so Oswald agreed to drop it.
Besides, Holloway is a long way off. All the time we were talking about
the paper Alice seemed to be thinking about something else, and when we
had done she said--

‘I believe we might be detectives ourselves, but I should not like to
get anybody into trouble.’

‘Not murderers or robbers?’ Dicky asked.

‘It wouldn’t be murderers,’ she said; ‘but I _have_ noticed something
strange. Only I feel a little frightened. Let’s ask Albert’s uncle
first.’

Alice is a jolly sight too fond of asking grown-up people things. And we
all said it was tommyrot, and she was to tell us.

‘Well, promise you won’t do anything without me,’ Alice said, and we
promised. Then she said--

‘This is a dark secret, and any one who thinks it is better not to be
involved in a career of crime-discovery had better go away ere yet it be
too late.’

So Dora said she had had enough of tents, and she was going to look at
the shops. H. O. went with her because he had twopence to spend. They
thought it was only a game of Alice’s but Oswald knew by the way she
spoke. He can nearly always tell. And when people are not telling the
truth Oswald generally knows by the way they look with their eyes.
Oswald is not proud of being able to do this. He knows it is through no
merit of his own that he is much cleverer than some people.

When they had gone, the rest of us got closer together and said--

‘Now then.’

‘Well,’ Alice said, ‘you know the house next door? The people have gone
to Scarborough. And the house is shut up. But last night _I saw a light
in the windows_.’

We asked her how and when, because her room is in the front, and she
couldn’t possibly have seen. And then she said--

‘I’ll tell you if you boys will promise not ever to go fishing again
without me.’

So we had to promise.

Then she said--

‘It was last night. I had forgotten to feed my rabbits and I woke up and
remembered it. And I was afraid I should find them dead in the morning,
like Oswald did.’

‘It wasn’t my fault,’ Oswald said; ‘there was something the matter with
the beasts. I fed them right enough.’

Alice said she didn’t mean that, and she went on--

‘I came down into the garden, and I saw a light in the house, and dark
figures moving about. I thought perhaps it was burglars, but Father
hadn’t come home, and Eliza had gone to bed, so I couldn’t do anything.
Only I thought perhaps I would tell the rest of you.’

‘Why didn’t you tell us this morning?’ Noel asked. And Alice explained
that she did not want to get any one into trouble, even burglars. ‘But
we might watch to-night,’ she said, ‘and see if we see the light again.’

‘They might have been burglars,’ Noel said. He was sucking the last bit
of his macaroni. ‘You know the people next door are very grand. They
won’t know us--and they go out in a real private carriage sometimes. And
they have an “At Home” day, and people come in cabs. I daresay they have
piles of plate and jewellery and rich brocades, and furs of price and
things like that. Let us keep watch to-night.’

‘It’s no use watching to-night,’ Dicky said; ‘if it’s only burglars they
won’t come again. But there are other things besides burglars that are
discovered in empty houses where lights are seen moving.’

‘You mean coiners,’ said Oswald at once. ‘I wonder what the reward is
for setting the police on their track?’

Dicky thought it ought to be something fat, because coiners are always
a desperate gang; and the machinery they make the coins with is so heavy
and handy for knocking down detectives.

Then it was tea-time, and we went in; and Dora and H. O. had clubbed
their money together and bought a melon; quite a big one, and only a
little bit squashy at one end. It was very good, and then we washed the
seeds and made things with them and with pins and cotton. And nobody
said any more about watching the house next door.

Only when we went to bed Dicky took off his coat and waistcoat, but he
stopped at his braces, and said--

‘What about the coiners?’

Oswald had taken off his collar and tie, and he was just going to say
the same, so he said, ‘Of course I meant to watch, only my collar’s
rather tight, so I thought I’d take it off first.’

Dicky said he did not think the girls ought to be in it, because there
might be danger, but Oswald reminded him that they had promised Alice,
and that a promise is a sacred thing, even when you’d much rather
not. So Oswald got Alice alone under pretence of showing her a
caterpillar--Dora does not like them, and she screamed and ran away when
Oswald offered to show it her. Then Oswald explained, and Alice agreed
to come and watch if she could. This made us later than we ought to have
been, because Alice had to wait till Dora was quiet and then creep out
very slowly, for fear of the boards creaking. The girls sleep with their
room-door open for fear of burglars. Alice had kept on her clothes
under her nightgown when Dora wasn’t looking, and presently we got down,
creeping past Father’s study, and out at the glass door that leads on
to the veranda and the iron steps into the garden. And we went down very
quietly, and got into the chestnut-tree; and then I felt that we had
only been playing what Albert’s uncle calls our favourite instrument--I
mean the Fool. For the house next door was as dark as dark. Then
suddenly we heard a sound--it came from the gate at the end of the
garden. All the gardens have gates; they lead into a kind of lane that
runs behind them. It is a sort of back way, very convenient when you
don’t want to say exactly where you are going. We heard the gate at the
end of the next garden click, and Dicky nudged Alice so that she
would have fallen out of the tree if it had not been for Oswald’s
extraordinary presence of mind. Oswald squeezed Alice’s arm tight, and
we all looked; and the others were rather frightened because really we
had not exactly expected anything to happen except perhaps a light. But
now a muffled figure, shrouded in a dark cloak, came swiftly up the
path of the next-door garden. And we could see that under its cloak the
figure carried a mysterious burden. The figure was dressed to look like
a woman in a sailor hat.

We held our breath as it passed under the tree where we were, and then
it tapped very gently on the back door and was let in, and then a light
appeared in the window of the downstairs back breakfast-room. But the
shutters were up.

Dicky said, ‘My eye!’ and wouldn’t the others be sick to think they
hadn’t been in this! But Alice didn’t half like it--and as she is a girl
I do not blame her. Indeed, I thought myself at first that perhaps
it would be better to retire for the present, and return later with a
strongly armed force.

‘It’s not burglars,’ Alice whispered; ‘the mysterious stranger was
bringing things in, not taking them out. They must be coiners--and oh,
Oswald!--don’t let’s! The things they coin with must hurt very much. Do
let’s go to bed!’

But Dicky said he was going to see; if there was a reward for finding
out things like this he would like to have the reward.

‘They locked the back door,’ he whispered, ‘I heard it go. And I could
look in quite well through the holes in the shutters and be back over
the wall long before they’d got the door open, even if they started to
do it at once.’

There were holes at the top of the shutters the shape of hearts, and the
yellow light came out through them as well as through the chinks of the
shutters.

Oswald said if Dicky went he should, because he was the eldest; and
Alice said, ‘If any one goes it ought to be me, because I thought of
it.’

So Oswald said, ‘Well, go then’; and she said, ‘Not for anything!’ And
she begged us not to, and we talked about it in the tree till we were
all quite hoarse with whispering.

At last we decided on a plan of action.

Alice was to stay in the tree, and scream ‘Murder!’ if anything
happened. Dicky and I were to get down into the next garden and take it
in turns to peep.

So we got down as quietly as we could, but the tree made much more noise
than it does in the day, and several times we paused, fearing that all
was discovered. But nothing happened.

There was a pile of red flower-pots under the window and one very large
one was on the window-ledge. It seemed as if it was the hand of Destiny
had placed it there, and the geranium in it was dead, and there was
nothing to stop your standing on it--so Oswald did. He went first
because he is the eldest, and though Dicky tried to stop him because he
thought of it first it could not be, on account of not being able to say
anything.

So Oswald stood on the flower-pot and tried to look through one of the
holes. He did not really expect to see the coiners at their fell work,
though he had pretended to when we were talking in the tree. But if he
had seen them pouring the base molten metal into tin moulds the shape of
half-crowns he would not have been half so astonished as he was at the
spectacle now revealed.

At first he could see little, because the hole had unfortunately been
made a little too high, so that the eye of the detective could only see
the Prodigal Son in a shiny frame on the opposite wall. But Oswald held
on to the window-frame and stood on tiptoe and then he _saw_.

There was no furnace, and no base metal, no bearded men in leathern
aprons with tongs and things, but just a table with a table-cloth on it
for supper, and a tin of salmon and a lettuce and some bottled beer. And
there on a chair was the cloak and the hat of the mysterious stranger,
and the two people sitting at the table were the two youngest grown-up
daughters of the lady next door, and one of them was saying--

‘So I got the salmon three-halfpence cheaper, and the lettuces are only
six a penny in the Broadway, just fancy! We must save as much as ever we
can on our housekeeping money if we want to go away decent next year.’

And the other said, ‘I wish we could _all_ go _every_ year, or
else--Really, I almost wish--’

And all the time Oswald was looking Dicky was pulling at his jacket to
make him get down and let Dicky have a squint. And just as she said ‘I
almost,’ Dicky pulled too hard and Oswald felt himself toppling on the
giddy verge of the big flower-pots. Putting forth all his strength our
hero strove to recover his equi-what’s-its-name, but it was now lost
beyond recall.

‘You’ve done it this time!’ he said, then he fell heavily among the
flower-pots piled below. He heard them crash and rattle and crack, and
then his head struck against an iron pillar used for holding up the
next-door veranda. His eyes closed and he knew no more.

Now you will perhaps expect that at this moment Alice would have cried
‘Murder!’ If you think so you little know what girls are. Directly she
was left alone in that tree she made a bolt to tell Albert’s uncle all
about it and bring him to our rescue in case the coiner’s gang was a
very desperate one. And just when I fell, Albert’s uncle was getting
over the wall. Alice never screamed at all when Oswald fell, but Dicky
thinks he heard Albert’s uncle say, ‘Confound those kids!’ which would
not have been kind or polite, so I hope he did not say it.

The people next door did not come out to see what the row was. Albert’s
uncle did not wait for them to come out. He picked up Oswald and carried
the insensible body of the gallant young detective to the wall, laid it
on the top, and then climbed over and bore his lifeless burden into our
house and put it on the sofa in Father’s study. Father was out, so
we needn’t have _crept_ so when we were getting into the garden. Then
Oswald was restored to consciousness, and his head tied up, and sent
to bed, and next day there was a lump on his young brow as big as a
turkey’s egg, and very uncomfortable.

Albert’s uncle came in next day and talked to each of us separately.
To Oswald he said many unpleasant things about ungentlemanly to spy on
ladies, and about minding your own business; and when I began to tell
him what I had heard he told me to shut up, and altogether he made me
more uncomfortable than the bump did.

Oswald did not say anything to any one, but next day, as the shadows of
eve were falling, he crept away, and wrote on a piece of paper, ‘I want
to speak to you,’ and shoved it through the hole like a heart in the top
of the next-door shutters. And the youngest young lady put an eye to
the heart-shaped hole, and then opened the shutter and said ‘Well?’ very
crossly. Then Oswald said--

‘I am very sorry, and I beg your pardon. We wanted to be detectives, and
we thought a gang of coiners infested your house, so we looked through
your window last night. I saw the lettuce, and I heard what you said
about the salmon being three-halfpence cheaper, and I know it is very
dishonourable to pry into other people’s secrets, especially ladies’,
and I never will again if you will forgive me this once.’

Then the lady frowned and then she laughed, and then she said--

‘So it was you tumbling into the flower-pots last night? We thought it
was burglars. It frightened us horribly. Why, what a bump on your poor
head!’

And then she talked to me a bit, and presently she said she and her
sister had not wished people to know they were at home, because--And
then she stopped short and grew very red, and I said, ‘I thought you
were all at Scarborough; your servant told Eliza so. Why didn’t you want
people to know you were at home?’

The lady got redder still, and then she laughed and said--

‘Never mind the reason why. I hope your head doesn’t hurt much. Thank
you for your nice, manly little speech. _You’ve_ nothing to be ashamed
of, at any rate.’ Then she kissed me, and I did not mind. And then she
said, ‘Run away now, dear. I’m going to--I’m going to pull up the blinds
and open the shutters, and I want to do it at _once_, before it gets
dark, so that every one can see we’re at home, and not at Scarborough.’



CHAPTER 4. GOOD HUNTING

When we had got that four shillings by digging for treasure we ought, by
rights, to have tried Dicky’s idea of answering the advertisement about
ladies and gentlemen and spare time and two pounds a week, but there
were several things we rather wanted.

Dora wanted a new pair of scissors, and she said she was going to get
them with her eight-pence. But Alice said--

‘You ought to get her those, Oswald, because you know you broke the
points off hers getting the marble out of the brass thimble.’

It was quite true, though I had almost forgotten it, but then it was H.
O. who jammed the marble into the thimble first of all. So I said--

‘It’s H. O.’s fault as much as mine, anyhow. Why shouldn’t he pay?’

Oswald didn’t so much mind paying for the beastly scissors, but he hates
injustice of every kind.

‘He’s such a little kid,’ said Dicky, and of course H. O. said he wasn’t
a little kid, and it very nearly came to being a row between them. But
Oswald knows when to be generous; so he said--

‘Look here! I’ll pay sixpence of the scissors, and H. O. shall pay the
rest, to teach him to be careful.’

H. O. agreed: he is not at all a mean kid, but I found out afterwards
that Alice paid his share out of her own money.

Then we wanted some new paints, and Noel wanted a pencil and a halfpenny
account-book to write poetry with, and it does seem hard never to have
any apples. So, somehow or other nearly all the money got spent, and we
agreed that we must let the advertisement run loose a little longer.

‘I only hope,’ Alice said, ‘that they won’t have got all the ladies and
gentlemen they want before we have got the money to write for the sample
and instructions.’

And I was a little afraid myself, because it seemed such a splendid
chance; but we looked in the paper every day, and the advertisement was
always there, so we thought it was all right.

Then we had the detective try-on--and it proved no go; and then, when
all the money was gone, except a halfpenny of mine and twopence of
Noel’s and three-pence of Dicky’s and a few pennies that the girls had
left, we held another council.

Dora was sewing the buttons on H. O.’s Sunday things. He got himself a
knife with his money, and he cut every single one of his best buttons
off. You’ve no idea how many buttons there are on a suit. Dora counted
them. There are twenty-four, counting the little ones on the sleeves
that don’t undo.

Alice was trying to teach Pincher to beg; but he has too much sense
when he knows you’ve got nothing in your hands, and the rest of us were
roasting potatoes under the fire. We had made a fire on purpose,
though it was rather warm. They are very good if you cut away the burnt
parts--but you ought to wash them first, or you are a dirty boy.

‘Well, what can we do?’ said Dicky. ‘You are so fond of saying “Let’s do
something!” and never saying what.’

‘We can’t try the advertisement yet. Shall we try rescuing some one?’
said Oswald. It was his own idea, but he didn’t insist on doing it,
though he is next to the eldest, for he knows it is bad manners to make
people do what you want, when they would rather not.

‘What was Noel’s plan?’ Alice asked.

‘A Princess or a poetry book,’ said Noel sleepily. He was lying on his
back on the sofa, kicking his legs. ‘Only I shall look for the Princess
all by myself. But I’ll let you see her when we’re married.’

‘Have you got enough poetry to make a book?’ Dicky asked that, and it
was rather sensible of him, because when Noel came to look there were
only seven of his poems that any of us could understand. There was the
‘Wreck of the Malabar’, and the poem he wrote when Eliza took us to hear
the Reviving Preacher, and everybody cried, and Father said it must have
been the Preacher’s Eloquence. So Noel wrote:

    O Eloquence and what art thou?
    Ay what art thou? because we cried
    And everybody cried inside
    When they came out their eyes were red--
    And it was your doing Father said.

But Noel told Alice he got the first line and a half from a book a boy
at school was going to write when he had time. Besides this there were
the ‘Lines on a Dead Black Beetle that was poisoned’--

    O Beetle how I weep to see
       Thee lying on thy poor back!
    It is so very sad indeed.
       You were so shiny and black.
    I wish you were alive again
    But Eliza says wishing it is nonsense and a shame.

It was very good beetle poison, and there were hundreds of them lying
dead--but Noel only wrote a piece of poetry for one of them. He said he
hadn’t time to do them all, and the worst of it was he didn’t know which
one he’d written it to--so Alice couldn’t bury the beetle and put the
lines on its grave, though she wanted to very much.

Well, it was quite plain that there wasn’t enough poetry for a book.

‘We might wait a year or two,’ said Noel. ‘I shall be sure to make some
more some time. I thought of a piece about a fly this morning that knew
condensed milk was sticky.’

‘But we want the money _now_,’ said Dicky, ‘and you can go on writing
just the same. It will come in some time or other.’

‘There’s poetry in newspapers,’ said Alice. ‘Down, Pincher! you’ll never
be a clever dog, so it’s no good trying.’

‘Do they pay for it?’ Dicky thought of that; he often thinks of things
that are really important, even if they are a little dull.

‘I don’t know. But I shouldn’t think any one would let them print their
poetry without. I wouldn’t I know.’ That was Dora; but Noel said he
wouldn’t mind if he didn’t get paid, so long as he saw his poetry
printed and his name at the end.

‘We might try, anyway,’ said Oswald. He is always willing to give other
people’s ideas a fair trial.

So we copied out ‘The Wreck of the Malabar’ and the other six poems on
drawing-paper--Dora did it, she writes best--and Oswald drew a picture
of the Malabar going down with all hands. It was a full-rigged schooner,
and all the ropes and sails were correct; because my cousin is in the
Navy, and he showed me.

We thought a long time whether we’d write a letter and send it by post
with the poetry--and Dora thought it would be best. But Noel said he
couldn’t bear not to know at once if the paper would print the poetry,
So we decided to take it.

I went with Noel, because I am the eldest, and he is not old enough to
go to London by himself. Dicky said poetry was rot--and he was glad he
hadn’t got to make a fool of himself. That was because there was not
enough money for him to go with us. H. O. couldn’t come either, but
he came to the station to see us off, and waved his cap and called out
‘Good hunting!’ as the train started.

There was a lady in spectacles in the corner. She was writing with a
pencil on the edges of long strips of paper that had print all down
them. When the train started she asked--

‘What was that he said?’

So Oswald answered--

‘It was “Good hunting”--it’s out of the Jungle Book!’ ‘That’s very
pleasant to hear,’ the lady said; ‘I am very pleased to meet people who
know their Jungle Book. And where are you off to--the Zoological Gardens
to look for Bagheera?’

We were pleased, too, to meet some one who knew the Jungle Book.

So Oswald said--

‘We are going to restore the fallen fortunes of the House of
Bastable--and we have all thought of different ways--and we’re going to
try them all. Noel’s way is poetry. I suppose great poets get paid?’

The lady laughed--she was awfully jolly--and said she was a sort of
poet, too, and the long strips of paper were the proofs of her new book
of stories. Because before a book is made into a real book with pages
and a cover, they sometimes print it all on strips of paper, and the
writer make marks on it with a pencil to show the printers what idiots
they are not to understand what a writer means to have printed.

We told her all about digging for treasure, and what we meant to do.
Then she asked to see Noel’s poetry--and he said he didn’t like--so she
said, ‘Look here--if you’ll show me yours I’ll show you some of mine.’
So he agreed.

The jolly lady read Noel’s poetry, and she said she liked it very much.
And she thought a great deal of the picture of the Malabar. And then she
said, ‘I write serious poetry like yours myself; too, but I have a piece
here that I think you will like because it’s about a boy.’ She gave it
to us--and so I can copy it down, and I will, for it shows that some
grown-up ladies are not so silly as others. I like it better than Noel’s
poetry, though I told him I did not, because he looked as if he was
going to cry. This was very wrong, for you should always speak the
truth, however unhappy it makes people. And I generally do. But I did
not want him crying in the railway carriage. The lady’s piece of poetry:

    Oh when I wake up in my bed
    And see the sun all fat and red,
    I’m glad to have another day
    For all my different kinds of play.

    There are so many things to do--
    The things that make a man of you,
    If grown-ups did not get so vexed
    And wonder what you will do next.

    I often wonder whether they
    Ever made up our kinds of play--
    If they were always good as gold
    And only did what they were told.

    They like you best to play with tops
    And toys in boxes, bought in shops;
    They do not even know the names
    Of really interesting games.

    They will not let you play with fire
    Or trip your sister up with wire,
    They grudge the tea-tray for a drum,
    Or booby-traps when callers come.

    They don’t like fishing, and it’s true
    You sometimes soak a suit or two:
    They look on fireworks, though they’re dry,
    With quite a disapproving eye.

    They do not understand the way
    To get the most out of your day:
    They do not know how hunger feels
    Nor what you need between your meals.

    And when you’re sent to bed at night,
    They’re happy, but they’re not polite.
    For through the door you hear them say:
    ‘_He’s_ done _his_ mischief for the day!’

She told us a lot of other pieces but I cannot remember them, and she
talked to us all the way up, and when we got nearly to Cannon Street she
said--

‘I’ve got two new shillings here! Do you think they would help to smooth
the path to Fame?’

Noel said, ‘Thank you,’ and was going to take the shilling. But Oswald,
who always remembers what he is told, said--

‘Thank you very much, but Father told us we ought never to take anything
from strangers.’

‘That’s a nasty one,’ said the lady--she didn’t talk a bit like a real
lady, but more like a jolly sort of grown-up boy in a dress and hat--‘a
very nasty one! But don’t you think as Noel and I are both poets I might
be considered a sort of relation? You’ve heard of brother poets, haven’t
you? Don’t you think Noel and I are aunt and nephew poets, or some
relationship of that kind?’

I didn’t know what to say, and she went on--

‘It’s awfully straight of you to stick to what your Father tells you,
but look here, you take the shillings, and here’s my card. When you
get home tell your Father all about it, and if he says No, you can just
bring the shillings back to me.’

So we took the shillings, and she shook hands with us and said,
‘Good-bye, and good hunting!’

We did tell Father about it, and he said it was all right, and when
he looked at the card he told us we were highly honoured, for the lady
wrote better poetry than any other lady alive now. We had never heard of
her, and she seemed much too jolly for a poet. Good old Kipling! We owe
him those two shillings, as well as the Jungle books!



CHAPTER 5. THE POET AND THE EDITOR

It was not bad sport--being in London entirely on our own hook. We asked
the way to Fleet Street, where Father says all the newspaper offices
are. They said straight on down Ludgate Hill--but it turned out to be
quite another way. At least _we_ didn’t go straight on.

We got to St Paul’s. Noel _would_ go in, and we saw where Gordon was
buried--at least the monument. It is very flat, considering what a man
he was.

When we came out we walked a long way, and when we asked a policeman he
said we’d better go back through Smithfield. So we did. They don’t burn
people any more there now, so it was rather dull, besides being a long
way, and Noel got very tired. He’s a peaky little chap; it comes of
being a poet, I think. We had a bun or two at different shops--out of
the shillings--and it was quite late in the afternoon when we got to
Fleet Street. The gas was lighted and the electric lights. There is a
jolly Bovril sign that comes off and on in different coloured lamps. We
went to the Daily Recorder office, and asked to see the Editor. It is a
big office, very bright, with brass and mahogany and electric lights.

They told us the Editor wasn’t there, but at another office. So we went
down a dirty street, to a very dull-looking place. There was a man there
inside, in a glass case, as if he was a museum, and he told us to write
down our names and our business. So Oswald wrote--

           OSWALD BASTABLE
            NOEL BASTABLE
      BUSINESS VERY PRIVATE INDEED

Then we waited on the stone stairs; it was very draughty. And the man in
the glass case looked at us as if we were the museum instead of him. We
waited a long time, and then a boy came down and said--

‘The Editor can’t see you. Will you please write your business?’ And he
laughed. I wanted to punch his head.

But Noel said, ‘Yes, I’ll write it if you’ll give me a pen and ink, and
a sheet of paper and an envelope.’

The boy said he’d better write by post. But Noel is a bit pig-headed;
it’s his worst fault. So he said--‘No, I’ll write it _now_.’ So I backed
him up by saying--

‘Look at the price penny stamps are since the coal strike!’

So the boy grinned, and the man in the glass case gave us pen and paper,
and Noel wrote. Oswald writes better than he does; but Noel would do it;
and it took a very long time, and then it was inky.

    DEAR MR EDITOR, I want you to print my poetry and pay for it,
    and I am a friend of Mrs Leslie’s; she is a poet too.

    Your affectionate friend,

    NOEL BASTABLE.

He licked the envelope a good deal, so that that boy shouldn’t read it
going upstairs; and he wrote ‘Very private’ outside, and gave the letter
to the boy. I thought it wasn’t any good; but in a minute the grinning
boy came back, and he was quite respectful, and said--‘The Editor says,
please will you step up?’

We stepped up. There were a lot of stairs and passages, and a queer sort
of humming, hammering sound and a very funny smell. The boy was now very
polite, and said it was the ink we smelt, and the noise was the printing
machines.

After going through a lot of cold passages we came to a door; the boy
opened it, and let us go in. There was a large room, with a big, soft,
blue-and-red carpet, and a roaring fire, though it was only October; and
a large table with drawers, and littered with papers, just like the one
in Father’s study. A gentleman was sitting at one side of the table; he
had a light moustache and light eyes, and he looked very young to be an
editor--not nearly so old as Father. He looked very tired and sleepy,
as if he had got up very early in the morning; but he was kind, and we
liked him. Oswald thought he looked clever. Oswald is considered a judge
of faces.

‘Well,’ said he, ‘so you are Mrs Leslie’s friends?’

‘I think so,’ said Noel; ‘at least she gave us each a shilling, and she
wished us “good hunting!”’

‘Good hunting, eh? Well, what about this poetry of yours? Which is the
poet?’

I can’t think how he could have asked! Oswald is said to be a very
manly-looking boy for his age. However, I thought it would look duffing
to be offended, so I said--

‘This is my brother Noel. He is the poet.’ Noel had turned quite pale.
He is disgustingly like a girl in some ways. The Editor told us to sit
down, and he took the poems from Noel, and began to read them. Noel got
paler and paler; I really thought he was going to faint, like he did
when I held his hand under the cold-water tap, after I had accidentally
cut him with my chisel. When the Editor had read the first poem--it was
the one about the beetle--he got up and stood with his back to us. It
was not manners; but Noel thinks he did it ‘to conceal his emotion,’ as
they do in books. He read all the poems, and then he said--

‘I like your poetry very much, young man. I’ll give you--let me see; how
much shall I give you for it?’

‘As much as ever you can,’ said Noel. ‘You see I want a good deal of
money to restore the fallen fortunes of the house of Bastable.’

The gentleman put on some eye-glasses and looked hard at us. Then he sat
down.

‘That’s a good idea,’ said he. ‘Tell me how you came to think of it.
And, I say, have you had any tea? They’ve just sent out for mine.’

He rang a tingly bell, and the boy brought in a tray with a teapot and
a thick cup and saucer and things, and he had to fetch another tray for
us, when he was told to; and we had tea with the Editor of the Daily
Recorder. I suppose it was a very proud moment for Noel, though I
did not think of that till afterwards. The Editor asked us a lot of
questions, and we told him a good deal, though of course I did not tell
a stranger all our reasons for thinking that the family fortunes wanted
restoring. We stayed about half an hour, and when we were going away he
said again--

‘I shall print all your poems, my poet; and now what do you think
they’re worth?’

‘I don’t know,’ Noel said. ‘You see I didn’t write them to sell.’

‘Why did you write them then?’ he asked.

Noel said he didn’t know; he supposed because he wanted to.

‘Art for Art’s sake, eh?’ said the Editor, and he seemed quite
delighted, as though Noel had said something clever.

‘Well, would a guinea meet your views?’ he asked.

I have read of people being at a loss for words, and dumb with emotion,
and I’ve read of people being turned to stone with astonishment, or
joy, or something, but I never knew how silly it looked till I saw Noel
standing staring at the Editor with his mouth open. He went red and he
went white, and then he got crimson, as if you were rubbing more and
more crimson lake on a palette. But he didn’t say a word, so Oswald had
to say--

‘I should jolly well think so.’

So the Editor gave Noel a sovereign and a shilling, and he shook hands
with us both, but he thumped Noel on the back and said--

‘Buck up, old man! It’s your first guinea, but it won’t be your last.
Now go along home, and in about ten years you can bring me some more
poetry. Not before--see? I’m just taking this poetry of yours because I
like it very much; but we don’t put poetry in this paper at all. I shall
have to put it in another paper I know of.’

‘What _do_ you put in your paper?’ I asked, for Father always takes the
Daily Chronicle, and I didn’t know what the Recorder was like. We chose
it because it has such a glorious office, and a clock outside lighted
up.

‘Oh, news,’ said he, ‘and dull articles, and things about Celebrities.
If you know any Celebrities, now?’

Noel asked him what Celebrities were.

‘Oh, the Queen and the Princes, and people with titles, and people who
write, or sing, or act--or do something clever or wicked.’

‘I don’t know anybody wicked,’ said Oswald, wishing he had known Dick
Turpin, or Claude Duval, so as to be able to tell the Editor things
about them. ‘But I know some one with a title--Lord Tottenham.’

‘The mad old Protectionist, eh? How did you come to know him?’

‘We don’t know him to speak to. But he goes over the Heath every day at
three, and he strides along like a giant--with a black cloak like Lord
Tennyson’s flying behind him, and he talks to himself like one o’clock.’

‘What does he say?’ The Editor had sat down again, and he was fiddling
with a blue pencil.

‘We only heard him once, close enough to understand, and then he said,
“The curse of the country, sir--ruin and desolation!” And then he went
striding along again, hitting at the furze-bushes as if they were the
heads of his enemies.’

‘Excellent descriptive touch,’ said the Editor. ‘Well, go on.’

‘That’s all I know about him, except that he stops in the middle of the
Heath every day, and he looks all round to see if there’s any one about,
and if there isn’t, he takes his collar off.’

The Editor interrupted--which is considered rude--and said--

‘You’re not romancing?’

‘I beg your pardon?’ said Oswald. ‘Drawing the long bow, I mean,’ said
the Editor.

Oswald drew himself up, and said he wasn’t a liar.

The Editor only laughed, and said romancing and lying were not at all
the same; only it was important to know what you were playing at. So
Oswald accepted his apology, and went on.

‘We were hiding among the furze-bushes one day, and we saw him do it. He
took off his collar, and he put on a clean one, and he threw the other
among the furze-bushes. We picked it up afterwards, and it was a beastly
paper one!’

‘Thank you,’ said the Editor, and he got up and put his hand in his
pocket. ‘That’s well worth five shillings, and there they are. Would you
like to see round the printing offices before you go home?’

I pocketed my five bob, and thanked him, and I said we should like it
very much. He called another gentleman and said something we couldn’t
hear. Then he said good-bye again; and all this time Noel hadn’t said a
word. But now he said, ‘I’ve made a poem about you. It is called “Lines
to a Noble Editor.” Shall I write it down?’

The Editor gave him the blue pencil, and he sat down at the Editor’s
table and wrote. It was this, he told me afterwards as well as he could
remember--

    May Life’s choicest blessings be your lot
    I think you ought to be very blest
    For you are going to print my poems--
    And you may have this one as well as the rest.

‘Thank you,’ said the Editor. ‘I don’t think I ever had a poem addressed
to me before. I shall treasure it, I assure you.’

Then the other gentleman said something about Maecenas, and we went off
to see the printing office with at least one pound seven in our pockets.

It _was_ good hunting, and no mistake!

But he never put Noel’s poetry in the Daily Recorder. It was quite a
long time afterwards we saw a sort of story thing in a magazine, on the
station bookstall, and that kind, sleepy-looking Editor had written it,
I suppose. It was not at all amusing. It said a lot about Noel and me,
describing us all wrong, and saying how we had tea with the Editor;
and all Noel’s poems were in the story thing. I think myself the Editor
seemed to make game of them, but Noel was quite pleased to see them
printed--so that’s all right. It wasn’t my poetry anyhow, I am glad to
say.



CHAPTER 6. NOEL’S PRINCESS

She happened quite accidentally. We were not looking for a Princess at
all just then; but Noel had said he was going to find a Princess all by
himself; and marry her--and he really did. Which was rather odd, because
when people say things are going to befall, very often they don’t. It
was different, of course, with the prophets of old.

We did not get any treasure by it, except twelve chocolate drops; but we
might have done, and it was an adventure, anyhow.

Greenwich Park is a jolly good place to play in, especially the parts
that aren’t near Greenwich. The parts near the Heath are first-rate.
I often wish the Park was nearer our house; but I suppose a Park is a
difficult thing to move.

Sometimes we get Eliza to put lunch in a basket, and we go up to the
Park. She likes that--it saves cooking dinner for us; and sometimes she
says of her own accord, ‘I’ve made some pasties for you, and you might
as well go into the Park as not. It’s a lovely day.’

She always tells us to rinse out the cup at the drinking-fountain, and
the girls do; but I always put my head under the tap and drink. Then you
are an intrepid hunter at a mountain stream--and besides, you’re sure
it’s clean. Dicky does the same, and so does H. O. But Noel always
drinks out of the cup. He says it is a golden goblet wrought by
enchanted gnomes.

The day the Princess happened was a fine, hot day, last October, and we
were quite tired with the walk up to the Park.

We always go in by the little gate at the top of Croom’s Hill. It is
the postern gate that things always happen at in stories. It was dusty
walking, but when we got in the Park it was ripping, so we rested a bit,
and lay on our backs, and looked up at the trees, and wished we could
play monkeys. I have done it before now, but the Park-keeper makes a row
if he catches you.

When we’d rested a little, Alice said--

‘It was a long way to the enchanted wood, but it is very nice now we are
there. I wonder what we shall find in it?’

‘We shall find deer,’ said Dicky, ‘if we go to look; but they go on the
other side of the Park because of the people with buns.’

Saying buns made us think of lunch, so we had it; and when we had done
we scratched a hole under a tree and buried the papers, because we know
it spoils pretty places to leave beastly, greasy papers lying about. I
remember Mother teaching me and Dora that, when we were quite little.
I wish everybody’s parents would teach them this useful lesson, and the
same about orange peel.

When we’d eaten everything there was, Alice whispered--

‘I see the white witch bear yonder among the trees! Let’s track it and
slay it in its lair.’

‘I am the bear,’ said Noel; so he crept away, and we followed him among
the trees. Often the witch bear was out of sight, and then you didn’t
know where it would jump out from; but sometimes we saw it, and just
followed.

‘When we catch it there’ll be a great fight,’ said Oswald; ‘and I shall
be Count Folko of Mont Faucon.’

‘I’ll be Gabrielle,’ said Dora. She is the only one of us who likes
doing girl’s parts.

‘I’ll be Sintram,’ said Alice; ‘and H. O. can be the Little Master.’

‘What about Dicky?’

‘Oh, I can be the Pilgrim with the bones.’

‘Hist!’ whispered Alice. ‘See his white fairy fur gleaming amid yonder
covert!’

And I saw a bit of white too. It was Noel’s collar, and it had come
undone at the back.

We hunted the bear in and out of the trees, and then we lost him
altogether; and suddenly we found the wall of the Park--in a place where
I’m sure there wasn’t a wall before. Noel wasn’t anywhere about, and
there was a door in the wall. And it was open; so we went through.

‘The bear has hidden himself in these mountain fastnesses,’ Oswald said.
‘I will draw my good sword and after him.’

So I drew the umbrella, which Dora always will bring in case it rains,
because Noel gets a cold on the chest at the least thing--and we went
on.

The other side of the wall it was a stable yard, all cobble-stones.

There was nobody about--but we could hear a man rubbing down a horse
and hissing in the stable; so we crept very quietly past, and Alice
whispered--

‘’Tis the lair of the Monster Serpent; I hear his deadly hiss! Beware!
Courage and despatch!’

We went over the stones on tiptoe, and we found another wall with
another door in it on the other side. We went through that too, on
tiptoe. It really was an adventure. And there we were in a shrubbery,
and we saw something white through the trees. Dora said it was the white
bear. That is so like Dora. She always begins to take part in a play
just when the rest of us are getting tired of it. I don’t mean this
unkindly, because I am very fond of Dora. I cannot forget how kind she
was when I had bronchitis; and ingratitude is a dreadful vice. But it is
quite true.

‘It is not a bear,’ said Oswald; and we all went on, still on tiptoe,
round a twisty path and on to a lawn, and there was Noel. His collar had
come undone, as I said, and he had an inky mark on his face that he made
just before we left the house, and he wouldn’t let Dora wash it off,
and one of his bootlaces was coming down. He was standing looking at a
little girl; she was the funniest little girl you ever saw.

She was like a china doll--the sixpenny kind; she had a white face, and
long yellow hair, done up very tight in two pigtails; her forehead was
very big and lumpy, and her cheeks came high up, like little shelves
under her eyes. Her eyes were small and blue. She had on a funny black
frock, with curly braid on it, and button boots that went almost up to
her knees. Her legs were very thin. She was sitting in a hammock chair
nursing a blue kitten--not a sky-blue one, of course, but the colour
of a new slate pencil. As we came up we heard her say to Noel--‘Who are
you?’

Noel had forgotten about the bear, and he was taking his favourite part,
so he said--‘I’m Prince Camaralzaman.’

The funny little girl looked pleased--

‘I thought at first you were a common boy,’ she said. Then she saw the
rest of us and said--

‘Are you all Princesses and Princes too?’

Of course we said ‘Yes,’ and she said--

‘I am a Princess also.’ She said it very well too, exactly as if it were
true. We were very glad, because it is so seldom you meet any children
who can begin to play right off without having everything explained to
them. And even then they will say they are going to ‘pretend to be’ a
lion, or a witch, or a king. Now this little girl just said ‘I _am_ a
Princess.’ Then she looked at Oswald and said, ‘I fancy I’ve seen you at
Baden.’

Of course Oswald said, ‘Very likely.’

The little girl had a funny voice, and all her words were quite plain,
each word by itself; she didn’t talk at all like we do.

H. O. asked her what the cat’s name was, and she said ‘Katinka.’ Then
Dicky said--

‘Let’s get away from the windows; if you play near windows some one
inside generally knocks at them and says “Don’t”.’

The Princess put down the cat very carefully and said--

‘I am forbidden to walk off the grass.’

‘That’s a pity,’ said Dora.

‘But I will if you like,’ said the Princess.

‘You mustn’t do things you are forbidden to do,’ Dora said; but Dicky
showed us that there was some more grass beyond the shrubs with only a
gravel path between. So I lifted the Princess over the gravel, so that
she should be able to say she hadn’t walked off the grass. When we got
to the other grass we all sat down, and the Princess asked us if
we liked ‘dragees’ (I know that’s how you spell it, for I asked
Albert-next-door’s uncle).

We said we thought not, but she pulled a real silver box out of her
pocket and showed us; they were just flat, round chocolates. We had two
each. Then we asked her her name, and she began, and when she began she
went on, and on, and on, till I thought she was never going to stop. H.
O. said she had fifty names, but Dicky is very good at figures, and he
says there were only eighteen. The first were Pauline, Alexandra, Alice,
and Mary was one, and Victoria, for we all heard that, and it ended
up with Hildegarde Cunigonde something or other, Princess of something
else.

When she’d done, H. O. said, ‘That’s jolly good! Say it again!’ and she
did, but even then we couldn’t remember it. We told her our names, but
she thought they were too short, so when it was Noel’s turn he said he
was Prince Noel Camaralzaman Ivan Constantine Charlemagne James John
Edward Biggs Maximilian Bastable Prince of Lewisham, but when she asked
him to say it again of course he could only get the first two names
right, because he’d made it up as he went on.

So the Princess said, ‘You are quite old enough to know your own name.’
She was very grave and serious.

She told us that she was the fifth cousin of Queen Victoria. We asked
who the other cousins were, but she did not seem to understand. She went
on and said she was seven times removed. She couldn’t tell us what that
meant either, but Oswald thinks it means that the Queen’s cousins are
so fond of her that they will keep coming bothering, so the Queen’s
servants have orders to remove them. This little girl must have been
very fond of the Queen to try so often to see her, and to have been
seven times removed. We could see that it is considered something to
be proud of; but we thought it was hard on the Queen that her cousins
wouldn’t let her alone.

Presently the little girl asked us where our maids and governesses were.

We told her we hadn’t any just now. And she said--

‘How pleasant! And did you come here alone?’

‘Yes,’ said Dora; ‘we came across the Heath.’

‘You are very fortunate,’ said the little girl. She sat very upright on
the grass, with her fat little hands in her lap. ‘I should like to go on
the Heath. There are donkeys there, with white saddle covers. I should
like to ride them, but my governess will not permit.’

‘I’m glad we haven’t a governess,’ H. O. said. ‘We ride the donkeys
whenever we have any pennies, and once I gave the man another penny to
make it gallop.’

‘You are indeed fortunate!’ said the Princess again, and when she looked
sad the shelves on her cheeks showed more than ever. You could have laid
a sixpence on them quite safely if you had had one.

‘Never mind,’ said Noel; ‘I’ve got a lot of money. Come out and have a
ride now.’ But the little girl shook her head and said she was afraid it
would not be correct.

Dora said she was quite right; then all of a sudden came one of those
uncomfortable times when nobody can think of anything to say, so we sat
and looked at each other. But at last Alice said we ought to be going.

‘Do not go yet,’ the little girl said. ‘At what time did they order your
carriage?’

‘Our carriage is a fairy one, drawn by griffins, and it comes when we
wish for it,’ said Noel.

The little girl looked at him very queerly, and said, ‘That is out of a
picture-book.’

Then Noel said he thought it was about time he was married if we were to
be home in time for tea. The little girl was rather stupid over it,
but she did what we told her, and we married them with Dora’s
pocket-handkerchief for a veil, and the ring off the back of one of the
buttons on H. O.’s blouse just went on her little finger.

Then we showed her how to play cross-touch, and puss in the corner,
and tag. It was funny, she didn’t know any games but battledore and
shuttlecock and les graces. But she really began to laugh at last and
not to look quite so like a doll.

She was Puss and was running after Dicky when suddenly she stopped short
and looked as if she was going to cry. And we looked too, and there were
two prim ladies with little mouths and tight hair. One of them said in
quite an awful voice, ‘Pauline, who are these children?’ and her voice
was gruff; with very curly R’s.

The little girl said we were Princes and Princesses--which was silly, to
a grown-up person that is not a great friend of yours.

The gruff lady gave a short, horrid laugh, like a husky bark, and said--

‘Princes, indeed! They’re only common children!’

Dora turned very red and began to speak, but the little girl cried out
‘Common children! Oh, I am so glad! When I am grown up I’ll always play
with common children.’

And she ran at us, and began to kiss us one by one, beginning
with Alice; she had got to H. O. when the horrid lady said--‘Your
Highness--go indoors at once!’

The little girl answered, ‘I won’t!’

Then the prim lady said--‘Wilson, carry her Highness indoors.’

And the little girl was carried away screaming, and kicking with her
little thin legs and her buttoned boots, and between her screams she
shrieked:

‘Common children! I am glad, glad, glad! Common children! Common
children!’

The nasty lady then remarked--‘Go at once, or I will send for the
police!’

So we went. H. O. made a face at her and so did Alice, but Oswald took
off his cap and said he was sorry if she was annoyed about anything;
for Oswald has always been taught to be polite to ladies, however nasty.
Dicky took his off, too, when he saw me do it; he says he did it first,
but that is a mistake. If I were really a common boy I should say it was
a lie.

Then we all came away, and when we got outside Dora said, ‘So she was
really a Princess. Fancy a Princess living _there_!’

‘Even Princesses have to live somewhere,’ said Dicky.

‘And I thought it was play. And it was real. I wish I’d known! I should
have liked to ask her lots of things,’ said Alice.

H. O. said he would have liked to ask her what she had for dinner and
whether she had a crown.

I felt, myself, we had lost a chance of finding out a great deal about
kings and queens. I might have known such a stupid-looking little girl
would never have been able to pretend, as well as that.

So we all went home across the Heath, and made dripping toast for tea.

When we were eating it Noel said, ‘I wish I could give _her_ some! It is
very good.’

He sighed as he said it, and his mouth was very full, so we knew he was
thinking of his Princess. He says now that she was as beautiful as the
day, but we remember her quite well, and she was nothing of the kind.



CHAPTER 7. BEING BANDITS

Noel was quite tiresome for ever so long after we found the Princess. He
would keep on wanting to go to the Park when the rest of us didn’t, and
though we went several times to please him, we never found that door
open again, and all of us except him knew from the first that it would
be no go.

So now we thought it was time to do something to rouse him from the
stupor of despair, which is always done to heroes when anything baffling
has occurred. Besides, we were getting very short of money again--the
fortunes of your house cannot be restored (not so that they will last,
that is), even by the one pound eight we got when we had the ‘good
hunting.’ We spent a good deal of that on presents for Father’s
birthday. We got him a paper-weight, like a glass bun, with a picture
of Lewisham Church at the bottom; and a blotting-pad, and a box of
preserved fruits, and an ivory penholder with a view of Greenwich
Park in the little hole where you look through at the top. He was most
awfully pleased and surprised, and when he heard how Noel and Oswald had
earned the money to buy the things he was more surprised still. Nearly
all the rest of our money went to get fireworks for the Fifth of
November. We got six Catherine wheels and four rockets; two hand-lights,
one red and one green; a sixpenny maroon; two Roman-candles--they cost
a shilling; some Italian streamers, a fairy fountain, and a tourbillon
that cost eighteen-pence and was very nearly worth it.

But I think crackers and squibs are a mistake. It’s true you get a lot
of them for the money, and they are not bad fun for the first two or
three dozen, but you get jolly sick of them before you’ve let off your
sixpenn’orth. And the only amusing way is not allowed: it is putting
them in the fire.

It always seems a long time till the evening when you have got fireworks
in the house, and I think as it was a rather foggy day we should have
decided to let them off directly after breakfast, only Father had said
he would help us to let them off at eight o’clock after he had had his
dinner, and you ought never to disappoint your father if you can help
it.

You see we had three good reasons for trying H. O.’s idea of restoring
the fallen fortunes of our house by becoming bandits on the Fifth of
November. We had a fourth reason as well, and that was the best reason
of the lot. You remember Dora thought it would be wrong to be bandits.
And the Fifth of November came while Dora was away at Stroud staying
with her godmother. Stroud is in Gloucestershire. We were determined to
do it while she was out of the way, because we did not think it wrong,
and besides we meant to do it anyhow.

We held a Council, of course, and laid our plans very carefully. We let
H. O. be Captain, because it was his idea. Oswald was Lieutenant. Oswald
was quite fair, because he let H. O. call himself Captain; but Oswald is
the eldest next to Dora, after all.

Our plan was this. We were all to go up on to the Heath. Our house is in
the Lewisham Road, but it’s quite close to the Heath if you cut up the
short way opposite the confectioner’s, past the nursery gardens and
the cottage hospital, and turn to the left again and afterwards to the
right. You come out then at the top of the hill, where the big guns are
with the iron fence round them, and where the bands play on Thursday
evenings in the summer.

We were to lurk in ambush there, and waylay an unwary traveller. We were
to call upon him to surrender his arms, and then bring him home and put
him in the deepest dungeon below the castle moat; then we were to load
him with chains and send to his friends for ransom.

You may think we had no chains, but you are wrong, because we used
to keep two other dogs once, besides Pincher, before the fall of the
fortunes of the ancient House of Bastable. And they were quite big dogs.

It was latish in the afternoon before we started. We thought we could
lurk better if it was nearly dark. It was rather foggy, and we waited
a good while beside the railings, but all the belated travellers were
either grown up or else they were Board School children. We weren’t
going to get into a row with grown-up people--especially strangers--and
no true bandit would ever stoop to ask a ransom from the relations of
the poor and needy. So we thought it better to wait.

As I said, it was Guy Fawkes Day, and if it had not been we should never
have been able to be bandits at all, for the unwary traveller we did
catch had been forbidden to go out because he had a cold in his head.
But he would run out to follow a guy, without even putting on a coat or
a comforter, and it was a very damp, foggy afternoon and nearly dark, so
you see it was his own fault entirely, and served him jolly well right.

We saw him coming over the Heath just as we were deciding to go home
to tea. He had followed that guy right across to the village (we call
Blackheath the village; I don’t know why), and he was coming back
dragging his feet and sniffing.

‘Hist, an unwary traveller approaches!’ whispered Oswald.

‘Muffle your horses’ heads and see to the priming of your pistols,’
muttered Alice. She always will play boys’ parts, and she makes Ellis
cut her hair short on purpose. Ellis is a very obliging hairdresser.

‘Steal softly upon him,’ said Noel; ‘for lo! ‘tis dusk, and no human
eyes can mark our deeds.’

So we ran out and surrounded the unwary traveller. It turned out to be
Albert-next-door, and he was very frightened indeed until he saw who we
were.

‘Surrender!’ hissed Oswald, in a desperate-sounding voice, as he caught
the arm of the Unwary. And Albert-next-door said, ‘All right! I’m
surrendering as hard as I can. You needn’t pull my arm off.’

We explained to him that resistance was useless, and I think he saw that
from the first. We held him tight by both arms, and we marched him home
down the hill in a hollow square of five.

He wanted to tell us about the guy, but we made him see that it was not
proper for prisoners to talk to the guard, especially about guys that
the prisoner had been told not to go after because of his cold.

When we got to where we live he said, ‘All right, I don’t want to tell
you. You’ll wish I had afterwards. You never saw such a guy.’

‘I can see _you_!’ said H. O. It was very rude, and Oswald told him so
at once, because it is his duty as an elder brother. But H. O. is very
young and does not know better yet, and besides it wasn’t bad for H. O.

Albert-next-door said, ‘You haven’t any manners, and I want to go in to
my tea. Let go of me!’

But Alice told him, quite kindly, that he was not going in to his tea,
but coming with us.

‘I’m not,’ said Albert-next-door; ‘I’m going home. Leave go! I’ve got
a bad cold. You’re making it worse.’ Then he tried to cough, which was
very silly, because we’d seen him in the morning, and he’d told us where
the cold was that he wasn’t to go out with. When he had tried to cough,
he said, ‘Leave go of me! You see my cold’s getting worse.’

‘You should have thought of that before,’ said Dicky; ‘you’re coming in
with us.’

‘Don’t be a silly,’ said Noel; ‘you know we told you at the very
beginning that resistance was useless. There is no disgrace in yielding.
We are five to your one.’

By this time Eliza had opened the door, and we thought it best to take
him in without any more parlaying. To parley with a prisoner is not done
by bandits.

Directly we got him safe into the nursery, H. O. began to jump about and
say, ‘Now you’re a prisoner really and truly!’

And Albert-next-door began to cry. He always does. I wonder he didn’t
begin long before--but Alice fetched him one of the dried fruits we
gave Father for his birthday. It was a green walnut. I have noticed
the walnuts and the plums always get left till the last in the box; the
apricots go first, and then the figs and pears; and the cherries, if
there are any.

So he ate it and shut up. Then we explained his position to him, so that
there should be no mistake, and he couldn’t say afterwards that he had
not understood.

‘There will be no violence,’ said Oswald--he was now Captain of the
Bandits, because we all know H. O. likes to be Chaplain when we
play prisoners--‘no violence. But you will be confined in a dark,
subterranean dungeon where toads and snakes crawl, and but little of the
light of day filters through the heavily mullioned windows. You will be
loaded with chains. Now don’t begin again, Baby, there’s nothing to
cry about; straw will be your pallet; beside you the gaoler will set a
ewer--a ewer is only a jug, stupid; it won’t eat you--a ewer with water;
and a mouldering crust will be your food.’

But Albert-next-door never enters into the spirit of a thing. He mumbled
something about tea-time.

Now Oswald, though stern, is always just, and besides we were all rather
hungry, and tea was ready. So we had it at once, Albert-next-door and
all--and we gave him what was left of the four-pound jar of apricot jam
we got with the money Noel got for his poetry. And we saved our crusts
for the prisoner.

Albert-next-door was very tiresome. Nobody could have had a nicer prison
than he had. We fenced him into a corner with the old wire nursery
fender and all the chairs, instead of putting him in the coal-cellar
as we had first intended. And when he said the dog-chains were cold the
girls were kind enough to warm his fetters thoroughly at the fire before
we put them on him.

We got the straw cases of some bottles of wine someone sent Father
one Christmas--it is some years ago, but the cases are quite good. We
unpacked them very carefully and pulled them to pieces and scattered
the straw about. It made a lovely straw pallet, and took ever so long to
make--but Albert-next-door has yet to learn what gratitude really is.
We got the bread trencher for the wooden platter where the prisoner’s
crusts were put--they were not mouldy, but we could not wait till they
got so, and for the ewer we got the toilet jug out of the spare-room
where nobody ever sleeps. And even then Albert-next-door couldn’t be
happy like the rest of us. He howled and cried and tried to get out, and
he knocked the ewer over and stamped on the mouldering crusts. Luckily
there was no water in the ewer because we had forgotten it, only dust
and spiders. So we tied him up with the clothes-line from the back
kitchen, and we had to hurry up, which was a pity for him. We might have
had him rescued by a devoted page if he hadn’t been so tiresome. In fact
Noel was actually dressing up for the page when Albert-next-door kicked
over the prison ewer.

We got a sheet of paper out of an old exercise-book, and we made H. O.
prick his own thumb, because he is our little brother and it is our duty
to teach him to be brave. We none of us mind pricking ourselves; we’ve
done it heaps of times. H. O. didn’t like it, but he agreed to do it,
and I helped him a little because he was so slow, and when he saw the
red bead of blood getting fatter and bigger as I squeezed his thumb he
was very pleased, just as I had told him he would be.

This is what we wrote with H. O.’s blood, only the blood gave out when
we got to ‘Restored’, and we had to write the rest with crimson lake,
which is not the same colour, though I always use it, myself, for
painting wounds.

While Oswald was writing it he heard Alice whispering to the prisoner
that it would soon be over, and it was only play. The prisoner left off
howling, so I pretended not to hear what she said. A Bandit Captain has
to overlook things sometimes. This was the letter--

    ‘Albert Morrison is held a prisoner by Bandits.
    On payment of three thousand pounds he will be
    restored to his sorrowing relatives, and all
    will be forgotten and forgiven.’

I was not sure about the last part, but Dicky was certain he had seen it
in the paper, so I suppose it must have been all right.

We let H. O. take the letter; it was only fair, as it was his blood it
was written with, and told him to leave it next door for Mrs Morrison.

H. O. came back quite quickly, and Albert-next-door’s uncle came with
him.

‘What is all this, Albert?’ he cried. ‘Alas, alas, my nephew! Do I find
you the prisoner of a desperate band of brigands?’

‘Bandits,’ said H. O; ‘you know it says bandits.’

‘I beg your pardon, gentlemen,’ said Albert-next-door’s uncle, ‘bandits
it is, of course. This, Albert, is the direct result of the pursuit of
the guy on an occasion when your doting mother had expressly warned you
to forgo the pleasures of the chase.’

Albert said it wasn’t his fault, and he hadn’t wanted to play.

‘So ho!’ said his uncle, ‘impenitent too! Where’s the dungeon?’

We explained the dungeon, and showed him the straw pallet and the ewer
and the mouldering crusts and other things.

‘Very pretty and complete,’ he said. ‘Albert, you are more highly
privileged than ever I was. No one ever made me a nice dungeon when I
was your age. I think I had better leave you where you are.’

Albert began to cry again and said he was sorry, and he would be a good
boy.

‘And on this old familiar basis you expect me to ransom you, do you?
Honestly, my nephew, I doubt whether you are worth it. Besides, the sum
mentioned in this document strikes me as excessive: Albert really is
_not_ worth three thousand pounds. Also by a strange and unfortunate
chance I haven’t the money about me. Couldn’t you take less?’

We said perhaps we could.

‘Say eightpence,’ suggested Albert-next-door’s uncle, ‘which is all the
small change I happen to have on my person.’

‘Thank you very much,’ said Alice as he held it out; ‘but are you sure
you can spare it? Because really it was only play.’

‘Quite sure. Now, Albert, the game is over. You had better run home to
your mother and tell her how much you’ve enjoyed yourself.’

When Albert-next-door had gone his uncle sat in the Guy Fawkes armchair
and took Alice on his knee, and we sat round the fire waiting till it
would be time to let off our fireworks. We roasted the chestnuts he
sent Dicky out for, and he told us stories till it was nearly seven. His
stories are first-rate--he does all the parts in different voices. At
last he said--

‘Look here, young-uns. I like to see you play and enjoy yourselves, and
I don’t think it hurts Albert to enjoy himself too.’

‘I don’t think he did much,’ said H. O. But I knew what
Albert-next-door’s uncle meant because I am much older than H. O. He
went on--

‘But what about Albert’s mother? Didn’t you think how anxious she would
be at his not coming home? As it happens I saw him come in with you, so
we knew it was all right. But if I hadn’t, eh?’

He only talks like that when he is very serious, or even angry. Other
times he talks like people in books--to us, I mean.

We none of us said anything. But I was thinking. Then Alice spoke.

Girls seem not to mind saying things that we don’t say. She put her arms
round Albert-next-door’s uncle’s neck and said--

‘We’re very, very sorry. We didn’t think about his mother. You see we
try very hard not to think about other people’s mothers because--’

Just then we heard Father’s key in the door and Albert-next-door’s uncle
kissed Alice and put her down, and we all went down to meet Father. As
we went I thought I heard Albert-next-door’s uncle say something that
sounded like ‘Poor little beggars!’

He couldn’t have meant us, when we’d been having such a jolly time, and
chestnuts, and fireworks to look forward to after dinner and everything!



CHAPTER 8. BEING EDITORS

It was Albert’s uncle who thought of our trying a newspaper. He said he
thought we should not find the bandit business a paying industry, as a
permanency, and that journalism might be.

We had sold Noel’s poetry and that piece of information about Lord
Tottenham to the good editor, so we thought it would not be a bad idea
to have a newspaper of our own. We saw plainly that editors must be very
rich and powerful, because of the grand office and the man in the glass
case, like a museum, and the soft carpets and big writing-table. Besides
our having seen a whole handful of money that the editor pulled out
quite carelessly from his trousers pocket when he gave me my five bob.

Dora wanted to be editor and so did Oswald, but he gave way to her
because she is a girl, and afterwards he knew that it is true what it
says in the copy-books about Virtue being its own Reward. Because you’ve
no idea what a bother it is. Everybody wanted to put in everything just
as they liked, no matter how much room there was on the page. It was
simply awful! Dora put up with it as long as she could and then she said
if she wasn’t let alone she wouldn’t go on being editor; they could be
the paper’s editors themselves, so there.

Then Oswald said, like a good brother: ‘I will help you if you like,
Dora,’ and she said, ‘You’re more trouble than all the rest of them!
Come and be editor and see how you like it. I give it up to you.’
But she didn’t, and we did it together. We let Albert-next-door be
sub-editor, because he had hurt his foot with a nail in his boot that
gathered.

When it was done Albert-next-door’s uncle had it copied for us in
typewriting, and we sent copies to all our friends, and then of course
there was no one left that we could ask to buy it. We did not think of
that until too late. We called the paper the Lewisham Recorder; Lewisham
because we live there, and Recorder in memory of the good editor. I
could write a better paper on my head, but an editor is not allowed to
write all the paper. It is very hard, but he is not. You just have to
fill up with what you can get from other writers. If I ever have time I
will write a paper all by myself. It won’t be patchy. We had no time to
make it an illustrated paper, but I drew the ship going down with all
hands for the first copy. But the typewriter can’t draw ships, so it was
left out in the other copies. The time the first paper took to write out
no one would believe! This was the Newspaper:

             ------------             EDITORIAL NOTE

Every paper is written for some reason. Ours is because we want to sell
it and get money. If what we have written brings happiness to any sad
heart we shall not have laboured in vain. But we want the money too.
Many papers are content with the sad heart and the happiness, but we are
not like that, and it is best not to be deceitful. EDITORS.

There will be two serial stories; One by Dicky and one by all of us. In
a serial story you only put in one chapter at a time. But we shall put
all our serial story at once, if Dora has time to copy it. Dicky’s will
come later on.

            SERIAL STORY
             BY US ALL

         CHAPTER I--by Dora

The sun was setting behind a romantic-looking tower when two strangers
might have been observed descending the crest of the hill. The eldest,
a man in the prime of life; the other a handsome youth who reminded
everybody of Quentin Durward. They approached the Castle, in which the
fair Lady Alicia awaited her deliverers. She leaned from the castellated
window and waved her lily hand as they approached. They returned her
signal, and retired to seek rest and refreshment at a neighbouring
hostelry.

             ------------         CHAPTER II--by Alice

The Princess was very uncomfortable in the tower, because her fairy
godmother had told her all sorts of horrid things would happen if she
didn’t catch a mouse every day, and she had caught so many mice that now
there were hardly any left to catch. So she sent her carrier pigeon to
ask the noble Strangers if they could send her a few mice--because she
would be of age in a few days and then it wouldn’t matter. So the fairy
godmother--- (I’m very sorry, but there’s no room to make the chapters
any longer.-ED.)

             ------------         CHAPTER III--by the Sub-Editor

(I can’t--I’d much rather not--I don’t know how.)

            ------------         CHAPTER IV--by Dicky

I must now retrace my steps and tell you something about our hero. You
must know he had been to an awfully jolly school, where they had turkey
and goose every day for dinner, and never any mutton, and as many helps
of pudding as a fellow cared to send up his plate for--so of course they
had all grown up very strong, and before he left school he challenged
the Head to have it out man to man, and he gave it him, I tell you. That
was the education that made him able to fight Red Indians, and to be the
stranger who might have been observed in the first chapter.

             ------------         CHAPTER V--by Noel

I think it’s time something happened in this story. So then the dragon
he came out, blowing fire out of his nose, and he said--

‘Come on, you valiant man and true, I’d like to have a set-to along of
you!’

(That’s bad English.--ED. I don’t care; it’s what the dragon said. Who
told you dragons didn’t talk bad English?--Noel.)

So the hero, whose name was Noeloninuris, replied--

     ‘My blade is sharp, my axe is keen,
     You’re not nearly as big
     As a good many dragons I’ve seen.’

(Don’t put in so much poetry, Noel. It’s not fair, because none of the
others can do it.--ED.)

And then they went at it, and he beat the dragon, just as he did the
Head in Dicky’s part of the Story, and so he married the Princess, and
they lived--- (No they didn’t--not till the last chapter.--ED.)

             ------------         CHAPTER VI--by H. O.

I think it’s a very nice Story--but what about the mice? I don’t want to
say any more. Dora can have what’s left of my chapter.

             ------------         CHAPTER VII--by the Editors

And so when the dragon was dead there were lots of mice, because he used
to kill them for his tea but now they rapidly multiplied and ravaged the
country, so the fair lady Alicia, sometimes called the Princess, had
to say she would not marry any one unless they could rid the country of
this plague of mice. Then the Prince, whose real name didn’t begin
with N, but was Osrawalddo, waved his magic sword, and the dragon stood
before them, bowing gracefully. They made him promise to be good, and
then they forgave him; and when the wedding breakfast came, all the
bones were saved for him. And so they were married and lived happy ever
after.

(What became of the other stranger?--NOEL. The dragon ate him because he
asked too many questions.--EDITORS.)

This is the end of the story.

            INSTRUCTIVE

It only takes four hours and a quarter now to get from London to
Manchester; but I should not think any one would if they could help it.

A DREADFUL WARNING. A wicked boy told me a very instructive thing about
ginger. They had opened one of the large jars, and he happened to take
out quite a lot, and he made it all right by dropping marbles in, till
there was as much ginger as before. But he told me that on the Sunday,
when it was coming near the part where there is only juice generally, I
had no idea what his feelings were. I don’t see what he could have said
when they asked him. I should be sorry to act like it.

In this so-called Nineteenth Century Science is but too little

that.

It is not generally known that if you put bits of camphor in luke-warm
water it will move about. If you drop sweet oil in, the camphor will
dart away and then stop moving. But don’t drop any till you are tired
of it, because the camphor won’t any more afterwards. Much amusement and
instruction is lost by not knowing things like this.

If you put a sixpence under a shilling in a wine-glass, and blow hard

in the Navy.

Alice. Nothing will ever make your hair curl, so it’s no use. Some
people say it’s more important to tidy up as you go along. I don’t mean
you in particular, but every one.

H. O. We never said you were tubby, but the Editor does not know any
cure.

Noel. If there is any of the paper over when this newspaper is finished,
I will exchange it for your shut-up inkstand, or the knife that has the
useful thing in it for taking stones out of horses’ feet, but you can’t
have it without.

H. O. There are many ways how your steam engine might stop working.
You might ask Dicky. He knows one of them. I think it is the way yours
stopped.

Noel. If you think that by filling the garden with sand you can make
crabs build their nests there you are not at all sensible.

You have altered your poem about the battle of Waterloo so often, that

If I ever keep a school everything shall be quite different. Nobody
shall learn anything they don’t want to. And sometimes instead of having
masters and mistresses we will have cats, and we will dress up in cat
skins and learn purring. ‘Now, my dears,’ the old cat will say, ‘one,
two, three all purr together,’ and we shall purr like anything.

             ------------    SAM REDFERN, OR THE BUSH RANGER’S BURIAL

             By Dicky

‘Well, Annie, I have bad news for you,’ said Mr Ridgway, as he entered
the comfortable dining-room of his cabin in the Bush. ‘Sam Redfern the
Bushranger is about this part of the Bush just now. I hope he will not
attack us with his gang.’

‘I hope not,’ responded Annie, a gentle maiden of some sixteen summers.

Just then came a knock at the door of the hut, and a gruff voice asked
them to open the door.

‘It is Sam Redfern the Bushranger, father,’ said the girl.

‘The same,’ responded the voice, and the next moment the hall door was
smashed in, and Sam Redfern sprang in, followed by his gang.

             ------------             CHAPTER II

Annie’s Father was at once overpowered, and Annie herself lay bound with
cords on the drawing-room sofa. Sam Redfern set a guard round the lonely
hut, and all human aid was despaired of. But you never know. Far away in
the Bush a different scene was being enacted.

‘Must be Injuns,’ said a tall man to himself as he pushed his way
through the brushwood. It was Jim Carlton, the celebrated detective. ‘I
know them,’ he added; ‘they are Apaches.’ just then ten Indians in full
war-paint appeared. Carlton raised his rifle and fired, and slinging
their scalps on his arm he hastened towards the humble log hut where
resided his affianced bride, Annie Ridgway, sometimes known as the
Flower of the Bush.

             ------------             CHAPTER III

The moon was low on the horizon, and Sam Redfern was seated at a
drinking bout with some of his boon companions.

They had rifled the cellars of the hut, and the rich wines flowed like
water in the golden goblets of Mr Ridgway.

But Annie had made friends with one of the gang, a noble, good-hearted
man who had joined Sam Redfern by mistake, and she had told him to go
and get the police as quickly as possible.

‘Ha! ha!’ cried Redfern, ‘now I am enjoying myself!’ He little knew that
his doom was near upon him.

Just then Annie gave a piercing scream, and Sam Redfern got up, seizing
his revolver. ‘Who are you?’ he cried, as a man entered.

‘I am Jim Carlton, the celebrated detective,’ said the new arrival.

Sam Redfern’s revolver dropped from his nerveless fingers, but the next
moment he had sprung upon the detective with the well-known activity of
the mountain sheep, and Annie shrieked, for she had grown to love the
rough Bushranger.

Peppermint is a great help with arithmetic. The boy who was second in
the Oxford Local always did it. He gave me two. The examiner said to
him, ‘Are you eating peppermints?’ And he said, ‘No, Sir.’

one. I’m glad I wasn’t asked. I should never have thought of that, and I
could have had to say ‘Yes.’--OSWALD.

    Hark! what is that noise of rolling

    ‘Tis the death-knell of the sailors
       And officers and passengers of the good ship Malabar.

    It was a fair and lovely noon
       When the good ship put out of port
    And people said ‘ah little we think
       How soon she will be the elements’ sport.’

    She was indeed a lovely sight
       Upon the billows with sails spread.
    But the captain folded his gloomy arms,
       Ah--if she had been a life-boat instead!

    See the captain stern yet gloomy
       Flings his son upon a rock,
    Hoping that there his darling boy
       May escape the wreck.

    Alas in vain the loud winds roared
       And nobody was saved.
    That was the wreck of the Malabar,

Oak trees come from acorns. Every one knows this. When Noel says he
could grow one from a peach stone wrapped up in oak leaves, he shows
that he knows nothing about gardening but marigolds, and when I passed
by his garden I thought they seemed just like weeds now the flowers have
been picked.

A boy once dared me to eat a bulb.

Dogs are very industrious and fond of gardening. Pincher is always
planting bones, but they never grow up. There couldn’t be a bone tree.
I think this is what makes him bark so unhappily at night. He has never
tried planting dog-biscuit, but he is fonder of bones, and perhaps he
wants to be quite sure about them first.

             ------------     SAM REDFERN, OR THE BUSHRANGER’S BURIAL

                By Dicky

             ------------         CHAPTER IV AND LAST

This would have been a jolly good story if they had let me finish it at
the beginning of the paper as I wanted to. But now I have forgotten how
I meant it to end, and I have lost my book about Red Indians, and all my
Boys of England have been sneaked. The girls say ‘Good riddance!’ so I
expect they did it. They want me just to put in which Annie married, but
I shan’t, so they will never know.

We have now put everything we can think of into the paper. It takes a
lot of thinking about. I don’t know how grown-ups manage to write all
they do. It must make their heads ache, especially lesson books.

Albert-next-door only wrote one chapter of the serial story, but he
could have done some more if he had wanted to. He could not write out
any of the things because he cannot spell. He says he can, but it takes
him such a long time he might just as well not be able. There are one or
two things more. I am sick of it, but Dora says she will write them in.

LEGAL ANSWER WANTED. A quantity of excellent string is offered if you
know whether there really is a law passed about not buying gunpowder
under thirteen.--DICKY.

The price of this paper is one shilling each, and sixpence extra for the
picture of the Malabar going down with all hands. If we sell one hundred
copies we will write another paper.

                  *   *   *

And so we would have done, but we never did. Albert-next-door’s uncle
gave us two shillings, that was all. You can’t restore fallen fortunes
with two shillings!



CHAPTER 9. THE G. B.

Being editors is not the best way to wealth. We all feel this now, and
highwaymen are not respected any more like they used to be.

I am sure we had tried our best to restore our fallen fortunes. We felt
their fall very much, because we knew the Bastables had been rich once.
Dora and Oswald can remember when Father was always bringing nice things
home from London, and there used to be turkeys and geese and wine and
cigars come by the carrier at Christmas-time, and boxes of candied fruit
and French plums in ornamental boxes with silk and velvet and gilding
on them. They were called prunes, but the prunes you buy at the grocer’s
are quite different. But now there is seldom anything nice brought from
London, and the turkey and the prune people have forgotten Father’s
address.

‘How _can_ we restore those beastly fallen fortunes?’ said Oswald.
‘We’ve tried digging and writing and princesses and being editors.’

‘And being bandits,’ said H. O.

‘When did you try that?’ asked Dora quickly. ‘You know I told you it was
wrong.’

‘It wasn’t wrong the way we did it,’ said Alice, quicker still, before
Oswald could say, ‘Who asked you to tell us anything about it?’
which would have been rude, and he is glad he didn’t. ‘We only caught
Albert-next-door.’

‘Oh, Albert-next-door!’ said Dora contemptuously, and I felt more
comfortable; for even after I didn’t say, ‘Who asked you, and cetera,’
I was afraid Dora was going to come the good elder sister over us. She
does that a jolly sight too often.

Dicky looked up from the paper he was reading and said, ‘This sounds
likely,’ and he read out--

    ‘L100 secures partnership in lucrative business for sale of
    useful patent.  L10 weekly.  No personal attendance necessary.
    Jobbins, 300, Old Street Road.’

‘I wish we could secure that partnership,’ said Oswald. He is twelve,
and a very thoughtful boy for his age.

Alice looked up from her painting. She was trying to paint a fairy
queen’s frock with green bice, and it wouldn’t rub. There is something
funny about green bice. It never will rub off; no matter how expensive
your paintbox is--and even boiling water is very little use.

She said, ‘Bother the bice! And, Oswald, it’s no use thinking about
that. Where are we to get a hundred pounds?’

‘Ten pounds a week is five pounds to us,’ Oswald went on--he had done
the sum in his head while Alice was talking--‘because partnership means
halves. It would be A1.’

Noel sat sucking his pencil--he had been writing poetry as usual. I saw
the first two lines--

     I wonder why Green Bice
     Is never very nice.

Suddenly he said, ‘I wish a fairy would come down the chimney and drop a
jewel on the table--a jewel worth just a hundred pounds.’

‘She might as well give you the hundred pounds while she was about it,’
said Dora.

‘Or while she was about it she might as well give us five pounds a
week,’ said Alice.

‘Or fifty,’ said I.

‘Or five hundred,’ said Dicky.

I saw H. O. open his mouth, and I knew he was going to say, ‘Or five
thousand,’ so I said--

‘Well, she won’t give us fivepence, but if you’d only do as I am always
saying, and rescue a wealthy old gentleman from deadly peril he would
give us a pot of money, and we could have the partnership and five
pounds a week. Five pounds a week would buy a great many things.’

Then Dicky said, ‘Why shouldn’t we borrow it?’ So we said, ‘Who from?’
and then he read this out of the paper--

     MONEY PRIVATELY WITHOUT FEES
     THE BOND STREET BANK
     Manager, Z. Rosenbaum.

     Advances cash from L20 to L10,000 on ladies’ or gentlemen’s
     note of hand alone, without security.  No fees.  No inquiries.
     Absolute privacy guaranteed.

‘What does it all mean?’ asked H. O.

‘It means that there is a kind gentleman who has a lot of money, and he
doesn’t know enough poor people to help, so he puts it in the paper
that he will help them, by lending them his money--that’s it, isn’t it,
Dicky?’

Dora explained this and Dicky said, ‘Yes.’ And H. O. said he was a
Generous Benefactor, like in Miss Edgeworth. Then Noel wanted to know
what a note of hand was, and Dicky knew that, because he had read it in
a book, and it was just a letter saying you will pay the money when you
can, and signed with your name.

‘No inquiries!’ said Alice. ‘Oh--Dicky--do you think he would?’

‘Yes, I think so,’ said Dicky. ‘I wonder Father doesn’t go to this kind
gentleman. I’ve seen his name before on a circular in Father’s study.’

‘Perhaps he has.’ said Dora.

But the rest of us were sure he hadn’t, because, of course, if he had,
there would have been more money to buy nice things. Just then Pincher
jumped up and knocked over the painting-water. He is a very careless
dog. I wonder why painting-water is always such an ugly colour? Dora ran
for a duster to wipe it up, and H. O. dropped drops of the water on his
hands and said he had got the plague. So we played at the plague for a
bit, and I was an Arab physician with a bath-towel turban, and cured
the plague with magic acid-drops. After that it was time for dinner, and
after dinner we talked it all over and settled that we would go and see
the Generous Benefactor the very next day. But we thought perhaps the G.
B.--it is short for Generous Benefactor--would not like it if there were
so many of us. I have often noticed that it is the worst of our being
six--people think six a great many, when it’s children. That sentence
looks wrong somehow. I mean they don’t mind six pairs of boots, or six
pounds of apples, or six oranges, especially in equations, but they
seem to think you ought not to have five brothers and sisters. Of course
Dicky was to go, because it was his idea. Dora had to go to Blackheath
to see an old lady, a friend of Father’s, so she couldn’t go. Alice
said _she_ ought to go, because it said, ‘Ladies _and_ gentlemen,’ and
perhaps the G. B. wouldn’t let us have the money unless there were both
kinds of us.

H. O. said Alice wasn’t a lady; and she said _he_ wasn’t going, anyway.
Then he called her a disagreeable cat, and she began to cry.

But Oswald always tries to make up quarrels, so he said--

‘You’re little sillies, both of you!’

And Dora said, ‘Don’t cry, Alice; he only meant you weren’t a grown-up
lady.’

Then H. O. said, ‘What else did you think I meant, Disagreeable?’

So Dicky said, ‘Don’t be disagreeable yourself, H. O. Let her alone and
say you’re sorry, or I’ll jolly well make you!’

So H. O. said he was sorry. Then Alice kissed him and said she was sorry
too; and after that H. O. gave her a hug, and said, ‘Now I’m _really and
truly_ sorry,’ So it was all right.

Noel went the last time any of us went to London, so he was out of it,
and Dora said she would take him to Blackheath if we’d take H. O. So as
there’d been a little disagreeableness we thought it was better to take
him, and we did. At first we thought we’d tear our oldest things a bit
more, and put some patches of different colours on them, to show the
G. B. how much we wanted money. But Dora said that would be a sort
of cheating, pretending we were poorer than we are. And Dora is right
sometimes, though she is our elder sister. Then we thought we’d better
wear our best things, so that the G. B. might see we weren’t so very
poor that he couldn’t trust us to pay his money back when we had it. But
Dora said that would be wrong too. So it came to our being quite honest,
as Dora said, and going just as we were, without even washing our faces
and hands; but when I looked at H. O. in the train I wished we had not
been quite so particularly honest.

Every one who reads this knows what it is like to go in the train, so I
shall not tell about it--though it was rather fun, especially the part
where the guard came for the tickets at Waterloo, and H. O. was under
the seat and pretended to be a dog without a ticket. We went to Charing
Cross, and we just went round to Whitehall to see the soldiers and then
by St James’s for the same reason--and when we’d looked in the shops a
bit we got to Brook Street, Bond Street. It was a brass plate on a
door next to a shop--a very grand place, where they sold bonnets and
hats--all very bright and smart, and no tickets on them to tell you
the price. We rang a bell and a boy opened the door and we asked for Mr
Rosenbaum. The boy was not polite; he did not ask us in. So then Dicky
gave him his visiting card; it was one of Father’s really, but the
name is the same, Mr Richard Bastable, and we others wrote our names
underneath. I happened to have a piece of pink chalk in my pocket and we
wrote them with that.

Then the boy shut the door in our faces and we waited on the step. But
presently he came down and asked our business. So Dicky said--

‘Money advanced, young shaver! and don’t be all day about it!’

And then he made us wait again, till I was quite stiff in my legs, but
Alice liked it because of looking at the hats and bonnets, and at last
the door opened, and the boy said--

‘Mr Rosenbaum will see you,’ so we wiped our feet on the mat, which said
so, and we went up stairs with soft carpets and into a room. It was a
beautiful room. I wished then we had put on our best things, or at least
washed a little. But it was too late now.

The room had velvet curtains and a soft, soft carpet, and it was full
of the most splendid things. Black and gold cabinets, and china, and
statues, and pictures. There was a picture of a cabbage and a pheasant
and a dead hare that was just like life, and I would have given worlds
to have it for my own. The fur was so natural I should never have been
tired of looking at it; but Alice liked the one of the girl with
the broken jug best. Then besides the pictures there were clocks and
candlesticks and vases, and gilt looking-glasses, and boxes of cigars
and scent and things littered all over the chairs and tables. It was a
wonderful place, and in the middle of all the splendour was a little old
gentleman with a very long black coat and a very long white beard and a
hookey nose--like a falcon. And he put on a pair of gold spectacles and
looked at us as if he knew exactly how much our clothes were worth.

And then, while we elder ones were thinking how to begin, for we had
all said ‘Good morning’ as we came in, of course, H. O. began before we
could stop him. He said:

‘Are you the G. B.?’

‘The _what_?’ said the little old gentleman.

‘The G. B.,’ said H. O., and I winked at him to shut up, but he didn’t
see me, and the G. B. did. He waved his hand at _me_ to shut up, so I
had to, and H. O. went on--‘It stands for Generous Benefactor.’

The old gentleman frowned. Then he said, ‘Your Father sent you here, I
suppose?’

‘No he didn’t,’ said Dicky. ‘Why did you think so?’

The old gentleman held out the card, and I explained that we took that
because Father’s name happens to be the same as Dicky’s.

‘Doesn’t he know you’ve come?’

‘No,’ said Alice, ‘we shan’t tell him till we’ve got the partnership,
because his own business worries him a good deal and we don’t want to
bother him with ours till it’s settled, and then we shall give him half
our share.’

The old gentleman took off his spectacles and rumpled his hair with his
hands, then he said, ‘Then what _did_ you come for?’

‘We saw your advertisement,’ Dicky said, ‘and we want a hundred pounds
on our note of hand, and my sister came so that there should be both
kinds of us; and we want it to buy a partnership with in the lucrative
business for sale of useful patent. No personal attendance necessary.’

‘I don’t think I quite follow you,’ said the G. B. ‘But one thing I
should like settled before entering more fully into the matter: why did
you call me Generous Benefactor?’

‘Well, you see,’ said Alice, smiling at him to show she wasn’t
frightened, though I know really she was, awfully, ‘we thought it was so
_very_ kind of you to try to find out the poor people who want money and
to help them and lend them your money.’

‘Hum!’ said the G. B. ‘Sit down.’

He cleared the clocks and vases and candlesticks off some of the chairs,
and we sat down. The chairs were velvety, with gilt legs. It was like a
king’s palace.

‘Now,’ he said, ‘you ought to be at school, instead of thinking about
money. Why aren’t you?’

We told him that we should go to school again when Father could manage
it, but meantime we wanted to do something to restore the fallen
fortunes of the House of Bastable. And we said we thought the lucrative
patent would be a very good thing. He asked a lot of questions, and we
told him everything we didn’t think Father would mind our telling, and
at last he said--

‘You wish to borrow money. When will you repay it?’

‘As soon as we’ve got it, of course,’ Dicky said.

Then the G. B. said to Oswald, ‘You seem the eldest,’ but I explained to
him that it was Dicky’s idea, so my being eldest didn’t matter. Then he
said to Dicky--‘You are a minor, I presume?’

Dicky said he wasn’t yet, but he had thought of being a mining engineer
some day, and going to Klondike.

‘Minor, not miner,’ said the G. B. ‘I mean you’re not of age?’

‘I shall be in ten years, though,’ said Dicky. ‘Then you might repudiate
the loan,’ said the G. B., and Dicky said ‘What?’

Of course he ought to have said ‘I beg your pardon. I didn’t quite catch
what you said’--that is what Oswald would have said. It is more polite
than ‘What.’

‘Repudiate the loan,’ the G. B repeated. ‘I mean you might say you would
not pay me back the money, and the law could not compel you to do so.’

‘Oh, well, if you think we’re such sneaks,’ said Dicky, and he got
up off his chair. But the G. B. said, ‘Sit down, sit down; I was only
joking.’

Then he talked some more, and at last he said--‘I don’t advise you to
enter into that partnership. It’s a swindle. Many advertisements are.
And I have not a hundred pounds by me to-day to lend you. But I will
lend you a pound, and you can spend it as you like. And when you are
twenty-one you shall pay me back.’

‘I shall pay you back long before that,’ said Dicky. ‘Thanks, awfully!
And what about the note of hand?’

‘Oh,’ said the G. B., ‘I’ll trust to your honour. Between gentlemen, you
know--and ladies’--he made a beautiful bow to Alice--‘a word is as good
as a bond.’

Then he took out a sovereign, and held it in his hand while he talked
to us. He gave us a lot of good advice about not going into business
too young, and about doing our lessons--just swatting a bit, on our own
hook, so as not to be put in a low form when we went back to school. And
all the time he was stroking the sovereign and looking at it as if he
thought it very beautiful. And so it was, for it was a new one. Then at
last he held it out to Dicky, and when Dicky put out his hand for it the
G. B. suddenly put the sovereign back in his pocket.

‘No,’ he said, ‘I won’t give you the sovereign. I’ll give you fifteen
shillings, and this nice bottle of scent. It’s worth far more than the
five shillings I’m charging you for it. And, when you can, you shall pay
me back the pound, and sixty per cent interest--sixty per cent, sixty
per cent.’

‘What’s that?’ said H. O.

The G. B. said he’d tell us that when we paid back the sovereign, but
sixty per cent was nothing to be afraid of. He gave Dicky the money. And
the boy was made to call a cab, and the G. B. put us in and shook hands
with us all, and asked Alice to give him a kiss, so she did, and H. O.
would do it too, though his face was dirtier than ever. The G. B. paid
the cabman and told him what station to go to, and so we went home.

That evening Father had a letter by the seven-o’clock post. And when
he had read it he came up into the nursery. He did not look quite so
unhappy as usual, but he looked grave.

‘You’ve been to Mr Rosenbaum’s,’ he said.

So we told him all about it. It took a long time, and Father sat in the
armchair. It was jolly. He doesn’t often come and talk to us now. He has
to spend all his time thinking about his business. And when we’d told
him all about it he said--

‘You haven’t done any harm this time, children; rather good than harm,
indeed. Mr Rosenbaum has written me a very kind letter.’

‘Is he a friend of yours, Father?’ Oswald asked. ‘He is an
acquaintance,’ said my father, frowning a little, ‘we have done some
business together. And this letter--’ he stopped and then said: ‘No;
you didn’t do any harm to-day; but I want you for the future not to do
anything so serious as to try to buy a partnership without consulting
me, that’s all. I don’t want to interfere with your plays and pleasures;
but you will consult me about business matters, won’t you?’

Of course we said we should be delighted, but then Alice, who was
sitting on his knee, said, ‘We didn’t like to bother you.’

Father said, ‘I haven’t much time to be with you, for my business takes
most of my time. It is an anxious business--but I can’t bear to think of
your being left all alone like this.’

He looked so sad we all said we liked being alone. And then he looked
sadder than ever.

Then Alice said, ‘We don’t mean that exactly, Father. It is rather
lonely sometimes, since Mother died.’

Then we were all quiet a little while. Father stayed with us till we
went to bed, and when he said good night he looked quite cheerful. So we
told him so, and he said--

‘Well, the fact is, that letter took a weight off my mind.’ I can’t
think what he meant--but I am sure the G. B. would be pleased if he
could know he had taken a weight off somebody’s mind. He is that sort of
man, I think.

We gave the scent to Dora. It is not quite such good scent as we thought
it would be, but we had fifteen shillings--and they were all good, so is
the G. B.

And until those fifteen shillings were spent we felt almost as jolly as
though our fortunes had been properly restored. You do not notice your
general fortune so much, as long as you have money in your pocket. This
is why so many children with regular pocket-money have never felt
it their duty to seek for treasure. So, perhaps, our not having
pocket-money was a blessing in disguise. But the disguise was quite
impenetrable, like the villains’ in the books; and it seemed still more
so when the fifteen shillings were all spent. Then at last the others
agreed to let Oswald try his way of seeking for treasure, but they were
not at all keen about it, and many a boy less firm than Oswald would
have chucked the whole thing. But Oswald knew that a hero must rely on
himself alone. So he stuck to it, and presently the others saw their
duty, and backed him up.



CHAPTER 10. LORD TOTTENHAM

Oswald is a boy of firm and unswerving character, and he had never
wavered from his first idea. He felt quite certain that the books were
right, and that the best way to restore fallen fortunes was to rescue an
old gentleman in distress. Then he brings you up as his own son: but
if you preferred to go on being your own father’s son I expect the old
gentleman would make it up to you some other way. In the books the least
thing does it--you put up the railway carriage window--or you pick up
his purse when he drops it--or you say a hymn when he suddenly asks you
to, and then your fortune is made.

The others, as I said, were very slack about it, and did not seem to
care much about trying the rescue. They said there wasn’t any deadly
peril, and we should have to make one before we could rescue the old
gentleman from it, but Oswald didn’t see that that mattered. However, he
thought he would try some of the easier ways first, by himself.

So he waited about the station, pulling up railway carriage windows for
old gentlemen who looked likely--but nothing happened, and at last the
porters said he was a nuisance. So that was no go. No one ever asked him
to say a hymn, though he had learned a nice short one, beginning ‘New
every morning’--and when an old gentleman did drop a two-shilling piece
just by Ellis’s the hairdresser’s, and Oswald picked it up, and was
just thinking what he should say when he returned it, the old gentleman
caught him by the collar and called him a young thief. It would have
been very unpleasant for Oswald if he hadn’t happened to be a very
brave boy, and knew the policeman on that beat very well indeed. So the
policeman backed him up, and the old gentleman said he was sorry, and
offered Oswald sixpence. Oswald refused it with polite disdain, and
nothing more happened at all.

When Oswald had tried by himself and it had not come off, he said to the
others, ‘We’re wasting our time, not trying to rescue the old gentleman
in deadly peril. Come--buck up! Do let’s do something!’

It was dinner-time, and Pincher was going round getting the bits off
the plates. There were plenty because it was cold-mutton day. And Alice
said--

‘It’s only fair to try Oswald’s way--he has tried all the things the
others thought of. Why couldn’t we rescue Lord Tottenham?’

Lord Tottenham is the old gentleman who walks over the Heath every day
in a paper collar at three o’clock--and when he gets halfway, if there
is no one about, he changes his collar and throws the dirty one into the
furze-bushes.

Dicky said, ‘Lord Tottenham’s all right--but where’s the deadly peril?’

And we couldn’t think of any. There are no highwaymen on Blackheath now,
I am sorry to say. And though Oswald said half of us could be highwaymen
and the other half rescue party, Dora kept on saying it would be wrong
to be a highwayman--and so we had to give that up.

Then Alice said, ‘What about Pincher?’

And we all saw at once that it could be done.

Pincher is very well bred, and he does know one or two things, though we
never could teach him to beg. But if you tell him to hold on--he will do
it, even if you only say ‘Seize him!’ in a whisper.

So we arranged it all. Dora said she wouldn’t play; she said she thought
it was wrong, and she knew it was silly--so we left her out, and she
went and sat in the dining-room with a goody-book, so as to be able to
say she didn’t have anything to do with it, if we got into a row over
it.

Alice and H. O. were to hide in the furze-bushes just by where Lord
Tottenham changes his collar, and they were to whisper, ‘Seize him!’ to
Pincher; and then when Pincher had seized Lord Tottenham we were to
go and rescue him from his deadly peril. And he would say, ‘How can I
reward you, my noble young preservers?’ and it would be all right.

So we went up to the Heath. We were afraid of being late. Oswald told
the others what Procrastination was--so they got to the furze-bushes a
little after two o’clock, and it was rather cold. Alice and H. O. and
Pincher hid, but Pincher did not like it any more than they did, and as
we three walked up and down we heard him whining. And Alice kept saying,
‘I _am_ so cold! Isn’t he coming yet?’ And H. O. wanted to come out
and jump about to warm himself. But we told him he must learn to be
a Spartan boy, and that he ought to be very thankful he hadn’t got a
beastly fox eating his inside all the time. H. O. is our little brother,
and we are not going to let it be our fault if he grows up a milksop.
Besides, it was not really cold. It was his knees--he wears socks. So
they stayed where they were. And at last, when even the other three who
were walking about were beginning to feel rather chilly, we saw Lord
Tottenham’s big black cloak coming along, flapping in the wind like a
great bird. So we said to Alice--

‘Hist! he approaches. You’ll know when to set Pincher on by hearing Lord
Tottenham talking to himself--he always does while he is taking off his
collar.’

Then we three walked slowly away whistling to show we were not thinking
of anything. Our lips were rather cold, but we managed to do it.

Lord Tottenham came striding along, talking to himself. People call him
the mad Protectionist. I don’t know what it means--but I don’t think
people ought to call a Lord such names.

As he passed us he said, ‘Ruin of the country, sir! Fatal error, fatal
error!’ And then we looked back and saw he was getting quite near where
Pincher was, and Alice and H. O. We walked on--so that he shouldn’t
think we were looking--and in a minute we heard Pincher’s bark, and then
nothing for a bit; and then we looked round, and sure enough good old
Pincher had got Lord Tottenham by the trouser leg and was holding on
like billy-ho, so we started to run.

Lord Tottenham had got his collar half off--it was sticking out sideways
under his ear--and he was shouting, ‘Help, help, murder!’ exactly as if
some one had explained to him beforehand what he was to do. Pincher was
growling and snarling and holding on. When we got to him I stopped and
said--

‘Dicky, we must rescue this good old man.’

Lord Tottenham roared in his fury, ‘Good old man be--’ something or
othered. ‘Call the dog off.’

So Oswald said, ‘It is a dangerous task--but who would hesitate to do an
act of true bravery?’

And all the while Pincher was worrying and snarling, and Lord Tottenham
shouting to us to get the dog away. He was dancing about in the road
with Pincher hanging on like grim death; and his collar flapping about,
where it was undone.

Then Noel said, ‘Haste, ere yet it be too late.’ So I said to Lord
Tottenham--

‘Stand still, aged sir, and I will endeavour to alleviate your
distress.’

He stood still, and I stooped down and caught hold of Pincher and
whispered, ‘Drop it, sir; drop it!’

So then Pincher dropped it, and Lord Tottenham fastened his collar
again--he never does change it if there’s any one looking--and he said--

‘I’m much obliged, I’m sure. Nasty vicious brute! Here’s something to
drink my health.’

But Dicky explained that we are teetotallers, and do not drink people’s
healths. So Lord Tottenham said, ‘Well, I’m much obliged any way. And
now I come to look at you--of course, you’re not young ruffians, but
gentlemen’s sons, eh? Still, you won’t be above taking a tip from an old
boy--I wasn’t when I was your age,’ and he pulled out half a sovereign.

It was very silly; but now we’d done it I felt it would be beastly mean
to take the old boy’s chink after putting him in such a funk. He didn’t
say anything about bringing us up as his own sons--so I didn’t know what
to do. I let Pincher go, and was just going to say he was very welcome,
and we’d rather not have the money, which seemed the best way out of it,
when that beastly dog spoiled the whole show. Directly I let him go he
began to jump about at us and bark for joy, and try to lick our faces.
He was so proud of what he’d done. Lord Tottenham opened his eyes and he
just said, ‘The dog seems to know you.’

And then Oswald saw it was all up, and he said, ‘Good morning,’ and
tried to get away. But Lord Tottenham said--

‘Not so fast!’ And he caught Noel by the collar. Noel gave a howl, and
Alice ran out from the bushes. Noel is her favourite. I’m sure I don’t
know why. Lord Tottenham looked at her, and he said--

‘So there are more of you!’ And then H. O. came out.

‘Do you complete the party?’ Lord Tottenham asked him. And H. O. said
there were only five of us this time.

Lord Tottenham turned sharp off and began to walk away, holding Noel by
the collar. We caught up with him, and asked him where he was going, and
he said, ‘To the Police Station.’ So then I said quite politely, ‘Well,
don’t take Noel; he’s not strong, and he easily gets upset. Besides, it
wasn’t his doing. If you want to take any one take me--it was my very
own idea.’

Dicky behaved very well. He said, ‘If you take Oswald I’ll go too, but
don’t take Noel; he’s such a delicate little chap.’

Lord Tottenham stopped, and he said, ‘You should have thought of that
before.’ Noel was howling all the time, and his face was very white, and
Alice said--

‘Oh, do let Noel go, dear, good, kind Lord Tottenham; he’ll faint if you
don’t, I know he will, he does sometimes. Oh, I wish we’d never done it!
Dora said it was wrong.’

‘Dora displayed considerable common sense,’ said Lord Tottenham, and he
let Noel go. And Alice put her arm round Noel and tried to cheer him up,
but he was all trembly, and as white as paper.

Then Lord Tottenham said--

‘Will you give me your word of honour not to try to escape?’

So we said we would.

‘Then follow me,’ he said, and led the way to a bench. We all followed,
and Pincher too, with his tail between his legs--he knew something was
wrong. Then Lord Tottenham sat down, and he made Oswald and Dicky and
H. O. stand in front of him, but he let Alice and Noel sit down. And he
said--

‘You set your dog on me, and you tried to make me believe you were
saving me from it. And you would have taken my half-sovereign. Such
conduct is most--No--you shall tell me what it is, sir, and speak the
truth.’

So I had to say it was most ungentlemanly, but I said I hadn’t been
going to take the half-sovereign.

‘Then what did you do it for?’ he asked. ‘The truth, mind.’

So I said, ‘I see now it was very silly, and Dora said it was wrong,
but it didn’t seem so till we did it. We wanted to restore the fallen
fortunes of our house, and in the books if you rescue an old gentleman
from deadly peril, he brings you up as his own son--or if you prefer
to be your father’s son, he starts you in business, so that you end in
wealthy affluence; and there wasn’t any deadly peril, so we made Pincher
into one--and so--’ I was so ashamed I couldn’t go on, for it did seem
an awfully mean thing. Lord Tottenham said--

‘A very nice way to make your fortune--by deceit and trickery. I have a
horror of dogs. If I’d been a weak man the shock might have killed me.
What do you think of yourselves, eh?’

We were all crying except Oswald, and the others say he was; and Lord
Tottenham went on--‘Well, well, I see you’re sorry. Let this be a lesson
to you; and we’ll say no more about it. I’m an old man now, but I was
young once.’

Then Alice slid along the bench close to him, and put her hand on his
arm: her fingers were pink through the holes in her woolly gloves, and
said, ‘I think you’re very good to forgive us, and we are really very,
very sorry. But we wanted to be like the children in the books--only
we never have the chances they have. Everything they do turns out all
right. But we _are_ sorry, very, very. And I know Oswald wasn’t going to
take the half-sovereign. Directly you said that about a tip from an old
boy I began to feel bad inside, and I whispered to H. O. that I wished
we hadn’t.’

Then Lord Tottenham stood up, and he looked like the Death of Nelson,
for he is clean shaved and it is a good face, and he said--

‘Always remember never to do a dishonourable thing, for money or for
anything else in the world.’

And we promised we would remember. Then he took off his hat, and we took
off ours, and he went away, and we went home. I never felt so cheap in
all my life! Dora said, ‘I told you so,’ but we didn’t mind even that so
much, though it was indeed hard to bear. It was what Lord Tottenham had
said about ungentlemanly. We didn’t go on to the Heath for a week after
that; but at last we all went, and we waited for him by the bench. When
he came along Alice said, ‘Please, Lord Tottenham, we have not been on
the Heath for a week, to be a punishment because you let us off. And we
have brought you a present each if you will take them to show you are
willing to make it up.’

He sat down on the bench, and we gave him our presents. Oswald gave him
a sixpenny compass--he bought it with my own money on purpose to give
him. Oswald always buys useful presents. The needle would not move after
I’d had it a day or two, but Lord Tottenham used to be an admiral, so
he will be able to make that go all right. Alice had made him a
shaving-case, with a rose worked on it. And H. O. gave him his
knife--the same one he once cut all the buttons off his best suit with.
Dicky gave him his prize, Naval Heroes, because it was the best thing he
had, and Noel gave him a piece of poetry he had made himself--

    When sin and shame bow down the brow
    Then people feel just like we do now.
    We are so sorry with grief and pain
    We never will be so ungentlemanly again.

Lord Tottenham seemed very pleased. He thanked us, and talked to us for
a bit, and when he said good-bye he said--

‘All’s fair weather now, mates,’ and shook hands.

And whenever we meet him he nods to us, and if the girls are with us
he takes off his hat, so he can’t really be going on thinking us
ungentlemanly now.



CHAPTER 11. CASTILIAN AMOROSO

One day when we suddenly found that we had half a crown we decided that
we really ought to try Dicky’s way of restoring our fallen fortunes
while yet the deed was in our power. Because it might easily have
happened to us never to have half a crown again. So we decided to dally
no longer with being journalists and bandits and things like them, but
to send for sample and instructions how to earn two pounds a week each
in our spare time. We had seen the advertisement in the paper, and we
had always wanted to do it, but we had never had the money to spare
before, somehow. The advertisement says: ‘Any lady or gentleman
can easily earn two pounds a week in their spare time. Sample and
instructions, two shillings. Packed free from observation.’ A good deal
of the half-crown was Dora’s. It came from her godmother; but she said
she would not mind letting Dicky have it if he would pay her back before
Christmas, and if we were sure it was right to try to make our fortune
that way. Of course that was quite easy, because out of two pounds a
week in your spare time you can easily pay all your debts, and have
almost as much left as you began with; and as to the right we told her
to dry up.

Dicky had always thought that this was really the best way to restore
our fallen fortunes, and we were glad that now he had a chance of trying
because of course we wanted the two pounds a week each, and besides, we
were rather tired of Dicky’s always saying, when our ways didn’t turn
out well, ‘Why don’t you try the sample and instructions about our spare
time?’

When we found out about our half-crown we got the paper. Noel was
playing admirals in it, but he had made the cocked hat without tearing
the paper, and we found the advertisement, and it said just the same as
ever. So we got a two-shilling postal order and a stamp, and what was
left of the money it was agreed we would spend in ginger-beer to drink
success to trade.

We got some nice paper out of Father’s study, and Dicky wrote the
letter, and we put in the money and put on the stamp, and made H. O.
post it. Then we drank the ginger-beer, and then we waited for the
sample and instructions. It seemed a long time coming, and the postman
got quite tired of us running out and stopping him in the street to ask
if it had come.

But on the third morning it came. It was quite a large parcel, and
it was packed, as the advertisement said it would be, ‘free from
observation.’ That means it was in a box; and inside the box was some
stiff browny cardboard, crinkled like the galvanized iron on the tops of
chicken-houses, and inside that was a lot of paper, some of it printed
and some scrappy, and in the very middle of it all a bottle, not
very large, and black, and sealed on the top of the cork with yellow
sealing-wax.

We looked at it as it lay on the nursery table, and while all the others
grabbed at the papers to see what the printing said, Oswald went to look
for the corkscrew, so as to see what was inside the bottle. He found
the corkscrew in the dresser drawer--it always gets there, though it is
supposed to be in the sideboard drawer in the dining-room--and when he
got back the others had read most of the printed papers.

‘I don’t think it’s much good, and I don’t think it’s quite nice to sell
wine,’ Dora said ‘and besides, it’s not easy to suddenly begin to sell
things when you aren’t used to it.’

‘I don’t know,’ said Alice; ‘I believe I could.’ They all looked rather
down in the mouth, though, and Oswald asked how you were to make your
two pounds a week.

‘Why, you’ve got to get people to taste that stuff in the bottle. It’s
sherry--Castilian Amoroso its name is--and then you get them to buy it,
and then you write to the people and tell them the other people want the
wine, and then for every dozen you sell you get two shillings from the
wine people, so if you sell twenty dozen a week you get your two pounds.
I don’t think we shall sell as much as that,’ said Dicky.

‘We might not the first week,’ Alice said, ‘but when people found out
how nice it was, they would want more and more. And if we only got ten
shillings a week it would be something to begin with, wouldn’t it?’

Oswald said he should jolly well think it would, and then Dicky took the
cork out with the corkscrew. The cork broke a good deal, and some of
the bits went into the bottle. Dora got the medicine glass that has
the teaspoons and tablespoons marked on it, and we agreed to have a
teaspoonful each, to see what it was like.

‘No one must have more than that,’ Dora said, ‘however nice it is.’

Dora behaved rather as if it were her bottle. I suppose it was, because
she had lent the money for it.

Then she measured out the teaspoonful, and she had first go, because of
being the eldest. We asked at once what it was like, but Dora could not
speak just then.

Then she said, ‘It’s like the tonic Noel had in the spring; but perhaps
sherry ought to be like that.’

Then it was Oswald’s turn. He thought it was very burny; but he said
nothing. He wanted to see first what the others would say.

Dicky said his was simply beastly, and Alice said Noel could taste next
if he liked.

Noel said it was the golden wine of the gods, but he had to put his
handkerchief up to his mouth all the same, and I saw the face he made.

Then H. O. had his, and he spat it out in the fire, which was very rude
and nasty, and we told him so.

Then it was Alice’s turn. She said, ‘Only half a teaspoonful for me,
Dora. We mustn’t use it all up.’ And she tasted it and said nothing.

Then Dicky said: ‘Look here, I chuck this. I’m not going to hawk round
such beastly stuff. Any one who likes can have the bottle. Quis?’

And Alice got out ‘Ego’ before the rest of us. Then she said, ‘I know
what’s the matter with it. It wants sugar.’

And at once we all saw that that was all there was the matter with the
stuff. So we got two lumps of sugar and crushed it on the floor with one
of the big wooden bricks till it was powdery, and mixed it with some of
the wine up to the tablespoon mark, and it was quite different, and not
nearly so nasty.

‘You see it’s all right when you get used to it,’ Dicky said. I think he
was sorry he had said ‘Quis?’ in such a hurry.

‘Of course,’ Alice said, ‘it’s rather dusty. We must crush the sugar
carefully in clean paper before we put it in the bottle.’

Dora said she was afraid it would be cheating to make one bottle nicer
than what people would get when they ordered a dozen bottles, but Alice
said Dora always made a fuss about everything, and really it would be
quite honest.

‘You see,’ she said, ‘I shall just tell them, quite truthfully, what
we have done to it, and when their dozens come they can do it for
themselves.’

So then we crushed eight more lumps, very cleanly and carefully between
newspapers, and shook it up well in the bottle, and corked it up with a
screw of paper, brown and not news, for fear of the poisonous printing
ink getting wet and dripping down into the wine and killing people. We
made Pincher have a taste, and he sneezed for ever so long, and after
that he used to go under the sofa whenever we showed him the bottle.

Then we asked Alice who she would try and sell it to. She said: ‘I shall
ask everybody who comes to the house. And while we are doing that, we
can be thinking of outside people to take it to. We must be careful:
there’s not much more than half of it left, even counting the sugar.’

We did not wish to tell Eliza--I don’t know why. And she opened the door
very quickly that day, so that the Taxes and a man who came to our house
by mistake for next door got away before Alice had a chance to try them
with the Castilian Amoroso. But about five Eliza slipped out for half an
hour to see a friend who was making her a hat for Sunday, and while
she was gone there was a knock. Alice went, and we looked over the
banisters. When she opened the door, she said at once, ‘Will you walk
in, please?’ The person at the door said, ‘I called to see your Pa,
miss. Is he at home?’

Alice said again, ‘Will you walk in, please?’

Then the person--it sounded like a man--said, ‘He is in, then?’

But Alice only kept on saying, ‘Will you walk in, please?’ so at last
the man did, rubbing his boots very loudly on the mat.

Then Alice shut the front door, and we saw that it was the butcher, with
an envelope in his hand. He was not dressed in blue, like when he is
cutting up the sheep and things in the shop, and he wore knickerbockers.
Alice says he came on a bicycle. She led the way into the dining-room,
where the Castilian Amoroso bottle and the medicine glass were standing
on the table all ready.

The others stayed on the stairs, but Oswald crept down and looked
through the door-crack.

‘Please sit down,’ said Alice quite calmly, though she told me
afterwards I had no idea how silly she felt. And the butcher sat down.
Then Alice stood quite still and said nothing, but she fiddled with
the medicine glass and put the screw of brown paper straight in the
Castilian bottle.

‘Will you tell your Pa I’d like a word with him?’ the butcher said, when
he got tired of saying nothing.

‘He’ll be in very soon, I think,’ Alice said.

And then she stood still again and said nothing. It was beginning to
look very idiotic of her, and H. O. laughed. I went back and cuffed him
for it quite quietly, and I don’t think the butcher heard.

But Alice did, and it roused her from her stupor. She spoke suddenly,
very fast indeed--so fast that I knew she had made up what she was going
to say before. She had got most of it out of the circular.

She said, ‘I want to call your attention to a sample of sherry wine I
have here. It is called Castilian something or other, and at the price
it is unequalled for flavour and bouquet.’

The butcher said, ‘Well--I never!’

And Alice went on, ‘Would you like to taste it?’

‘Thank you very much, I’m sure, miss,’ said the butcher.

Alice poured some out.

The butcher tasted a very little. He licked his lips, and we thought
he was going to say how good it was. But he did not. He put down the
medicine glass with nearly all the stuff left in it (we put it back in
the bottle afterwards to save waste) and said, ‘Excuse me, miss, but
isn’t it a little sweet?--for sherry I mean?’

‘The _Real_ isn’t,’ said Alice. ‘If you order a dozen it will come quite
different to that--we like it best with sugar. I wish you _would_ order
some.’ The butcher asked why.

Alice did not speak for a minute, and then she said--

‘I don’t mind telling _you_: you are in business yourself, aren’t
you? We are trying to get people to buy it, because we shall have two
shillings for every dozen we can make any one buy. It’s called a purr
something.’

‘A percentage. Yes, I see,’ said the butcher, looking at the hole in the
carpet.

‘You see there are reasons,’ Alice went on, ‘why we want to make our
fortunes as quickly as we can.’

‘Quite so,’ said the butcher, and he looked at the place where the paper
is coming off the wall.

‘And this seems a good way,’ Alice went on. ‘We paid two shillings for
the sample and instructions, and it says you can make two pounds a week
easily in your leisure time.’

‘I’m sure I hope you may, miss,’ said the butcher. And Alice said again
would he buy some?

‘Sherry is my favourite wine,’ he said. Alice asked him to have some
more to drink.

‘No, thank you, miss,’ he said; ‘it’s my favourite wine, but it doesn’t
agree with me; not the least bit. But I’ve an uncle drinks it. Suppose I
ordered him half a dozen for a Christmas present? Well, miss, here’s the
shilling commission, anyway,’ and he pulled out a handful of money and
gave her the shilling.

‘But I thought the wine people paid that,’ Alice said.

But the butcher said not on half-dozens they didn’t. Then he said he
didn’t think he’d wait any longer for Father--but would Alice ask Father
to write him?

Alice offered him the sherry again, but he said something about ‘Not
for worlds!’--and then she let him out and came back to us with the
shilling, and said, ‘How’s that?’

And we said ‘A1.’

And all the evening we talked of our fortune that we had begun to make.

Nobody came next day, but the day after a lady came to ask for money to
build an orphanage for the children of dead sailors. And we saw her. I
went in with Alice. And when we had explained to her that we had only
a shilling and we wanted it for something else, Alice suddenly said,
‘Would you like some wine?’

And the lady said, ‘Thank you very much,’ but she looked surprised.

She was not a young lady, and she had a mantle with beads, and the beads
had come off in places--leaving a browny braid showing, and she had
printed papers about the dead sailors in a sealskin bag, and the
seal had come off in places, leaving the skin bare. We gave her a
tablespoonful of the wine in a proper wine-glass out of the sideboard,
because she was a lady. And when she had tasted it she got up in a very
great hurry, and shook out her dress and snapped her bag shut, and said,
‘You naughty, wicked children! What do you mean by playing a trick like
this? You ought to be ashamed of yourselves! I shall write to your Mamma
about it. You dreadful little girl!--you might have poisoned me. But
your Mamma...’

Then Alice said, ‘I’m very sorry; the butcher liked it, only he said it
was sweet. And please don’t write to Mother. It makes Father so unhappy
when letters come for her!’--and Alice was very near crying.

‘What do you mean, you silly child?’ said the lady, looking quite
bright and interested. ‘Why doesn’t your Father like your Mother to have
letters--eh?’

And Alice said, ‘OH, you...!’ and began to cry, and bolted out of the
room.

Then I said, ‘Our Mother is dead, and will you please go away now?’

The lady looked at me a minute, and then she looked quite different, and
she said, ‘I’m very sorry. I didn’t know. Never mind about the wine. I
daresay your little sister meant it kindly.’ And she looked round the
room just like the butcher had done. Then she said again, ‘I didn’t
know--I’m very sorry...’

So I said, ‘Don’t mention it,’ and shook hands with her, and let her
out. Of course we couldn’t have asked her to buy the wine after what
she’d said. But I think she was not a bad sort of person. I do like
a person to say they’re sorry when they ought to be--especially a
grown-up. They do it so seldom. I suppose that’s why we think so much of
it.

But Alice and I didn’t feel jolly for ever so long afterwards. And when
I went back into the dining-room I saw how different it was from when
Mother was here, and we are different, and Father is different, and
nothing is like it was. I am glad I am not made to think about it every
day.

I went and found Alice, and told her what the lady had said, and when
she had finished crying we put away the bottle and said we would not try
to sell any more to people who came. And we did not tell the others--we
only said the lady did not buy any--but we went up on the Heath, and
some soldiers went by and there was a Punch-and-judy show, and when we
came back we were better.

The bottle got quite dusty where we had put it, and perhaps the dust of
ages would have laid thick and heavy on it, only a clergyman called when
we were all out. He was not our own clergyman--Mr Bristow is our own
clergyman, and we all love him, and we would not try to sell sherry
to people we like, and make two pounds a week out of them in our spare
time. It was another clergyman, just a stray one; and he asked Eliza if
the dear children would not like to come to his little Sunday school. We
always spend Sunday afternoons with Father. But as he had left the name
of his vicarage with Eliza, and asked her to tell us to come, we thought
we would go and call on him, just to explain about Sunday afternoons,
and we thought we might as well take the sherry with us.

‘I won’t go unless you all go too,’ Alice said, ‘and I won’t do the
talking.’

Dora said she thought we had much better not go; but we said ‘Rot!’ and
it ended in her coming with us, and I am glad she did.

Oswald said he would do the talking if the others liked, and he learned
up what to say from the printed papers.

We went to the Vicarage early on Saturday afternoon, and rang at the
bell. It is a new red house with no trees in the garden, only very
yellow mould and gravel. It was all very neat and dry. Just before we
rang the bell we heard some one inside call ‘Jane! Jane!’ and we thought
we would not be Jane for anything. It was the sound of the voice that
called that made us sorry for her.

The door was opened by a very neat servant in black, with a white apron;
we saw her tying the strings as she came along the hall, through the
different-coloured glass in the door. Her face was red, and I think she
was Jane.

We asked if we could see Mr Mallow.

The servant said Mr Mallow was very busy with his sermon just then, but
she would see.

But Oswald said, ‘It’s all right. He asked us to come.’

So she let us all in and shut the front door, and showed us into a very
tidy room with a bookcase full of a lot of books covered in black cotton
with white labels, and some dull pictures, and a harmonium. And Mr
Mallow was writing at a desk with drawers, copying something out of a
book. He was stout and short, and wore spectacles.

He covered his writing up when we went in--I didn’t know why. He looked
rather cross, and we heard Jane or somebody being scolded outside by the
voice. I hope it wasn’t for letting us in, but I have had doubts.

‘Well,’ said the clergyman, ‘what is all this about?’

‘You asked us to call,’ Dora said, ‘about your little Sunday school. We
are the Bastables of Lewisham Road.’

‘Oh--ah, yes,’ he said; ‘and shall I expect you all to-morrow?’

He took up his pen and fiddled with it, and he did not ask us to sit
down. But some of us did.

‘We always spend Sunday afternoon with Father,’ said Dora; ‘but we
wished to thank you for being so kind as to ask us.’

‘And we wished to ask you something else!’ said Oswald; and he made
a sign to Alice to get the sherry ready in the glass. She did--behind
Oswald’s back while he was speaking.

‘My time is limited,’ said Mr Mallow, looking at his watch; ‘but
still--’ Then he muttered something about the fold, and went on: ‘Tell
me what is troubling you, my little man, and I will try to give you any
help in my power. What is it you want?’

Then Oswald quickly took the glass from Alice, and held it out to him,
and said, ‘I want your opinion on that.’

‘On _that_,’ he said. ‘What is it?’

‘It is a shipment,’ Oswald said; ‘but it’s quite enough for you to
taste.’ Alice had filled the glass half-full; I suppose she was too
excited to measure properly.

‘A shipment?’ said the clergyman, taking the glass in his hand.

‘Yes,’ Oswald went On; ‘an exceptional opportunity. Full-bodied and
nutty.’

‘It really does taste rather like one kind of Brazil-nut.’ Alice put her
oar in as usual.

The Vicar looked from Alice to Oswald, and back again, and Oswald went
on with what he had learned from the printing. The clergyman held the
glass at half-arm’s-length, stiffly, as if he had caught cold.

‘It is of a quality never before offered at the price. Old Delicate
Amoro--what’s its name--’

‘Amorolio,’ said H. O.

‘Amoroso,’ said Oswald. ‘H. O., you just shut up--Castilian
Amoroso--it’s a true after-dinner wine, stimulating and yet...’

‘_Wine_?’ said Mr Mallow, holding the glass further off. ‘Do you
_know_,’ he went on, making his voice very thick and strong (I expect he
does it like that in church), ‘have you never been _taught_ that it is
the drinking of _wine_ and _spirits_--yes, and _beer_, which makes half
the homes in England full of _wretched_ little children, and _degraded_,
_miserable_ parents?’

‘Not if you put sugar in it,’ said Alice firmly; ‘eight lumps and shake
the bottle. We have each had more than a teaspoonful of it, and we were
not ill at all. It was something else that upset H. O. Most likely all
those acorns he got out of the Park.’

The clergyman seemed to be speechless with conflicting emotions, and
just then the door opened and a lady came in. She had a white cap with
lace, and an ugly violet flower in it, and she was tall, and looked
very strong, though thin. And I do believe she had been listening at the
door.

‘But why,’ the Vicar was saying, ‘why did you bring this dreadful fluid,
this curse of our country, to _me_ to taste?’

‘Because we thought you might buy some,’ said Dora, who never sees when
a game is up. ‘In books the parson loves his bottle of old port; and new
sherry is just as good--with sugar--for people who like sherry. And if
you would order a dozen of the wine, then we should get two shillings.’

The lady said (and it _was_ the voice), ‘Good gracious! Nasty, sordid
little things! Haven’t they any one to teach them better?’

And Dora got up and said, ‘No, we are not those things you say; but we
are sorry we came here to be called names. We want to make our fortune
just as much as Mr Mallow does--only no one would listen to us if we
preached, so it’s no use our copying out sermons like him.’

And I think that was smart of Dora, even if it was rather rude.

Then I said perhaps we had better go, and the lady said, ‘I should think
so!’

But when we were going to wrap up the bottle and glass the clergyman
said, ‘No; you can leave that,’ and we were so upset we did, though it
wasn’t his after all.

We walked home very fast and not saying much, and the girls went up to
their rooms. When I went to tell them tea was ready, and there was
a teacake, Dora was crying like anything and Alice hugging her. I am
afraid there is a great deal of crying in this chapter, but I can’t help
it. Girls will sometimes; I suppose it is their nature, and we ought to
be sorry for their affliction.

‘It’s no good,’ Dora was saying, ‘you all hate me, and you think I’m
a prig and a busybody, but I do try to do right--oh, I do! Oswald, go
away; don’t come here making fun of me!’

So I said, ‘I’m not making fun, Sissy; don’t cry, old girl.’

Mother taught me to call her Sissy when we were very little and before
the others came, but I don’t often somehow, now we are old. I patted her
on the back, and she put her head against my sleeve, holding on to Alice
all the time, and she went on. She was in that laughy-cryey state when
people say things they wouldn’t say at other times.

‘Oh dear, oh dear--I do try, I do. And when Mother died she said, “Dora,
take care of the others, and teach them to be good, and keep them out of
trouble and make them happy.” She said, “Take care of them for me, Dora
dear.” And I have tried, and all of you hate me for it; and to-day I let
you do this, though I knew all the time it was silly.’

I hope you will not think I was a muff but I kissed Dora for some time.
Because girls like it. And I will never say again that she comes the
good elder sister too much. And I have put all this in though I do hate
telling about it, because I own I have been hard on Dora, but I never
will be again. She is a good old sort; of course we never knew before
about what Mother told her, or we wouldn’t have ragged her as we did. We
did not tell the little ones, but I got Alice to speak to Dicky, and we
three can sit on the others if requisite.

This made us forget all about the sherry; but about eight o’clock there
was a knock, and Eliza went, and we saw it was poor Jane, if her name
was Jane, from the Vicarage. She handed in a brown-paper parcel and a
letter. And three minutes later Father called us into his study.

On the table was the brown-paper parcel, open, with our bottle and glass
on it, and Father had a letter in his hand. He Pointed to the bottle and
sighed, and said, ‘What have you been doing now?’ The letter in his hand
was covered with little black writing, all over the four large pages.

So Dicky spoke up, and he told Father the whole thing, as far as he knew
it, for Alice and I had not told about the dead sailors’ lady.

And when he had done, Alice said, ‘Has Mr Mallow written to you to say
he will buy a dozen of the sherry after all? It is really not half bad
with sugar in it.’

Father said no, he didn’t think clergymen could afford such expensive
wine; and he said _he_ would like to taste it. So we gave him what there
was left, for we had decided coming home that we would give up trying
for the two pounds a week in our spare time.

Father tasted it, and then he acted just as H. O. had done when he had
his teaspoonful, but of course we did not say anything. Then he laughed
till I thought he would never stop.

I think it was the sherry, because I am sure I have read somewhere about
‘wine that maketh glad the heart of man’. He had only a very little,
which shows that it was a good after-dinner wine, stimulating, and yet
...I forget the rest.

But when he had done laughing he said, ‘It’s all right, kids. Only don’t
do it again. The wine trade is overcrowded; and besides, I thought you
promised to consult me before going into business?’

‘Before buying one I thought you meant,’ said Dicky. ‘This was only on
commission.’ And Father laughed again. I am glad we got the Castilian
Amoroso, because it did really cheer Father up, and you cannot always do
that, however hard you try, even if you make jokes, or give him a comic
paper.



CHAPTER 12. THE NOBLENESS OF OSWALD

The part about his nobleness only comes at the end, but you would
not understand it unless you knew how it began. It began, like nearly
everything about that time, with treasure-seeking.

Of course as soon as we had promised to consult my Father about business
matters we all gave up wanting to go into business. I don’t know how it
is, but having to consult about a thing with grown-up people, even
the bravest and the best, seems to make the thing not worth doing
afterwards.

We don’t mind Albert’s uncle chipping in sometimes when the thing’s
going on, but we are glad he never asked us to promise to consult him
about anything. Yet Oswald saw that my Father was quite right; and I
daresay if we had had that hundred pounds we should have spent it on the
share in that lucrative business for the sale of useful patent, and then
found out afterwards that we should have done better to spend the money
in some other way. My Father says so, and he ought to know. We had
several ideas about that time, but having so little chink always stood
in the way.

This was the case with H. O.’s idea of setting up a coconut-shy on this
side of the Heath, where there are none generally. We had no sticks
or wooden balls, and the greengrocer said he could not book so many as
twelve dozen coconuts without Mr Bastable’s written order. And as we did
not wish to consult my Father it was decided to drop it. And when Alice
dressed up Pincher in some of the dolls’ clothes and we made up our
minds to take him round with an organ as soon as we had taught him to
dance, we were stopped at once by Dicky’s remembering how he had once
heard that an organ cost seven hundred pounds. Of course this was
the big church kind, but even the ones on three legs can’t be got for
one-and-sevenpence, which was all we had when we first thought of it. So
we gave that up too.

It was a wet day, I remember, and mutton hash for dinner--very tough
with pale gravy with lumps in it. I think the others would have left a
good deal on the sides of their plates, although they know better, only
Oswald said it was a savoury stew made of the red deer that Edward shot.
So then we were the Children of the New Forest, and the mutton tasted
much better. No one in the New Forest minds venison being tough and the
gravy pale.

Then after dinner we let the girls have a dolls’ tea-party, on condition
they didn’t expect us boys to wash up; and it was when we were drinking
the last of the liquorice water out of the little cups that Dicky said--

‘This reminds me.’

So we said, ‘What of?’

Dicky answered us at once, though his mouth was full of bread with
liquorice stuck in it to look like cake. You should not speak with your
mouth full, even to your own relations, and you shouldn’t wipe your
mouth on the back of your hand, but on your handkerchief, if you have
one. Dicky did not do this. He said--

‘Why, you remember when we first began about treasure-seeking, I said
I had thought of something, only I could not tell you because I hadn’t
finished thinking about it.’

We said ‘Yes.’

‘Well, this liquorice water--’

‘Tea,’ said Alice softly.

‘Well, tea then--made me think.’ He was going on to say what it made him
think, but Noel interrupted and cried out, ‘I say; let’s finish off this
old tea-party and have a council of war.’

So we got out the flags and the wooden sword and the drum, and Oswald
beat it while the girls washed up, till Eliza came up to say she had the
jumping toothache, and the noise went through her like a knife. So of
course Oswald left off at once. When you are polite to Oswald he never
refuses to grant your requests.

When we were all dressed up we sat down round the camp fire, and Dicky
began again.

‘Every one in the world wants money. Some people get it. The people who
get it are the ones who see things. I have seen one thing.’

Dicky stopped and smoked the pipe of peace. It is the pipe we did
bubbles with in the summer, and somehow it has not got broken yet.
We put tea-leaves in it for the pipe of peace, but the girls are not
allowed to have any. It is not right to let girls smoke. They get to
think too much of themselves if you let them do everything the same as
men. Oswald said, ‘Out with it.’

‘I see that glass bottles only cost a penny. H. O., if you dare to
snigger I’ll send you round selling old bottles, and you shan’t have any
sweets except out of the money you get for them. And the same with you,
Noel.’

‘Noel wasn’t sniggering,’ said Alice in a hurry; ‘it is only his taking
so much interest in what you were saying makes him look like that. Be
quiet, H. O., and don’t you make faces, either. Do go on, Dicky dear.’

So Dicky went on.

‘There must be hundreds of millions of bottles of medicines sold every
year. Because all the different medicines say, “Thousands of cures
daily,” and if you only take that as two thousand, which it must be, at
least, it mounts up. And the people who sell them must make a great deal
of money by them because they are nearly always two-and-ninepence
the bottle, and three-and-six for one nearly double the size. Now the
bottles, as I was saying, don’t cost anything like that.’

‘It’s the medicine costs the money,’ said Dora; ‘look how expensive
jujubes are at the chemist’s, and peppermints too.’

‘That’s only because they’re nice,’ Dicky explained; ‘nasty things are
not so dear. Look what a lot of brimstone you get for a penny, and the
same with alum. We would not put the nice kinds of chemist’s things in
our medicine.’

Then he went on to tell us that when we had invented our medicine we
would write and tell the editor about it, and he would put it in
the paper, and then people would send their two-and-ninepence and
three-and-six for the bottle nearly double the size, and then when the
medicine had cured them they would write to the paper and their letters
would be printed, saying how they had been suffering for years, and
never thought to get about again, but thanks to the blessing of our
ointment--’

Dora interrupted and said, ‘Not ointment--it’s so messy.’ And Alice
thought so too. And Dicky said he did not mean it, he was quite decided
to let it be in bottles. So now it was all settled, and we did not
see at the time that this would be a sort of going into business, but
afterwards when Albert’s uncle showed us we saw it, and we were sorry.
We only had to invent the medicine. You might think that was easy,
because of the number of them you see every day in the paper, but it is
much harder than you think. First we had to decide what sort of illness
we should like to cure, and a ‘heated discussion ensued’, like in
Parliament.

Dora wanted it to be something to make the complexion of dazzling
fairness, but we remembered how her face came all red and rough when
she used the Rosabella soap that was advertised to make the darkest
complexion fair as the lily, and she agreed that perhaps it was better
not. Noel wanted to make the medicine first and then find out what
it would cure, but Dicky thought not, because there are so many more
medicines than there are things the matter with us, so it would be
easier to choose the disease first. Oswald would have liked wounds.
I still think it was a good idea, but Dicky said, ‘Who has wounds,
especially now there aren’t any wars? We shouldn’t sell a bottle a day!’
So Oswald gave in because he knows what manners are, and it was Dicky’s
idea. H. O. wanted a cure for the uncomfortable feeling that they give
you powders for, but we explained to him that grown-up people do not
have this feeling, however much they eat, and he agreed. Dicky said
he did not care a straw what the loathsome disease was, as long as we
hurried up and settled on something. Then Alice said--

‘It ought to be something very common, and only one thing. Not the pains
in the back and all the hundreds of things the people have in somebody’s
syrup. What’s the commonest thing of all?’

And at once we said, ‘Colds.’

So that was settled.

Then we wrote a label to go on the bottle. When it was written it would
not go on the vinegar bottle that we had got, but we knew it would go
small when it was printed. It was like this:

                 BASTABLE’S
           CERTAIN CURE FOR COLDS
Coughs, Asthma, Shortness of Breath, and all infections of the Chest

     One dose gives immediate relief
   It will cure your cold in one bottle
     Especially the larger size at 3s. 6d.
       Order at once of the Makers
       To prevent disappointment

               Makers:

     D., O., R., A., N., and H. O. BASTABLE
             150, Lewisham Road, S.E.

    (A halfpenny for all bottles returned)

             ------------

Of course the next thing was for one of us to catch a cold and try what
cured it; we all wanted to be the one, but it was Dicky’s idea, and he
said he was not going to be done out of it, so we let him. It was only
fair. He left off his undershirt that very day, and next morning he
stood in a draught in his nightgown for quite a long time. And we damped
his day-shirt with the nail-brush before he put it on. But all was vain.
They always tell you that these things will give you cold, but we found
it was not so.

So then we all went over to the Park, and Dicky went right into the
water with his boots on, and stood there as long as he could bear it,
for it was rather cold, and we stood and cheered him on. He walked home
in his wet clothes, which they say is a sure thing, but it was no go,
though his boots were quite spoiled. And three days after Noel began to
cough and sneeze.

So then Dicky said it was not fair.

‘I can’t help it,’ Noel said. ‘You should have caught it yourself, then
it wouldn’t have come to me.’

And Alice said she had known all along Noel oughtn’t to have stood about
on the bank cheering in the cold.

Noel had to go to bed, and then we began to make the medicines; we were
sorry he was out of it, but he had the fun of taking the things.

We made a great many medicines. Alice made herb tea. She got sage and
thyme and savory and marjoram and boiled them all up together with salt
and water, but she _would_ put parsley in too. Oswald is sure parsley is
not a herb. It is only put on the cold meat and you are not supposed to
eat it. It kills parrots to eat parsley, I believe. I expect it was the
parsley that disagreed so with Noel. The medicine did not seem to do the
cough any good.

Oswald got a pennyworth of alum, because it is so cheap, and some
turpentine which every one knows is good for colds, and a little sugar
and an aniseed ball. These were mixed in a bottle with water, but Eliza
threw it away and said it was nasty rubbish, and I hadn’t any money to
get more things with.

Dora made him some gruel, and he said it did his chest good; but of
course that was no use, because you cannot put gruel in bottles and say
it is medicine. It would not be honest, and besides nobody would believe
you.

Dick mixed up lemon-juice and sugar and a little of the juice of the red
flannel that Noel’s throat was done up in. It comes out beautifully
in hot water. Noel took this and he liked it. Noel’s own idea was
liquorice-water, and we let him have it, but it is too plain and black
to sell in bottles at the proper price.

Noel liked H. O.’s medicine the best, which was silly of him, because it
was only peppermints melted in hot water, and a little cobalt to make
it look blue. It was all right, because H. O.’s paint-box is the French
kind, with Couleurs non Veneneuses on it. This means you may suck your
brushes if you want to, or even your paints if you are a very little
boy.

It was rather jolly while Noel had that cold. He had a fire in his
bedroom which opens out of Dicky’s and Oswald’s, and the girls used to
read aloud to Noel all day; they will not read aloud to you when you are
well. Father was away at Liverpool on business, and Albert’s uncle was
at Hastings. We were rather glad of this, because we wished to give
all the medicines a fair trial, and grown-ups are but too fond of
interfering. As if we should have given him anything poisonous!

His cold went on--it was bad in his head, but it was not one of the kind
when he has to have poultices and can’t sit up in bed. But when it had
been in his head nearly a week, Oswald happened to tumble over Alice on
the stairs. When we got up she was crying.

‘Don’t cry silly!’ said Oswald; ‘you know I didn’t hurt you.’ I was very
sorry if I had hurt her, but you ought not to sit on the stairs in the
dark and let other people tumble over you. You ought to remember how
beastly it is for them if they do hurt you.

‘Oh, it’s not that, Oswald,’ Alice said. ‘Don’t be a pig! I am so
miserable. Do be kind to me.’

So Oswald thumped her on the back and told her to shut up.

‘It’s about Noel,’ she said. ‘I’m sure he’s very ill; and playing about
with medicines is all very well, but I know he’s ill, and Eliza won’t
send for the doctor: she says it’s only a cold. And I know the doctor’s
bills are awful. I heard Father telling Aunt Emily so in the summer. But
he _is_ ill, and perhaps he’ll die or something.’

Then she began to cry again. Oswald thumped her again, because he knows
how a good brother ought to behave, and said, ‘Cheer up.’ If we had been
in a book Oswald would have embraced his little sister tenderly, and
mingled his tears with hers.

Then Oswald said, ‘Why not write to Father?’

And she cried more and said, ‘I’ve lost the paper with the address. H.
O. had it to draw on the back of, and I can’t find it now; I’ve looked
everywhere. I’ll tell you what I’m going to do. No I won’t. But I’m
going out. Don’t tell the others. And I say, Oswald, do pretend I’m in
if Eliza asks. Promise.’

‘Tell me what you’re going to do,’ I said. But she said ‘No’; and there
was a good reason why not. So I said I wouldn’t promise if it came to
that. Of course I meant to all right. But it did seem mean of her not to
tell me.

So Alice went out by the side door while Eliza was setting tea, and she
was a long time gone; she was not in to tea. When Eliza asked Oswald
where she was he said he did not know, but perhaps she was tidying
her corner drawer. Girls often do this, and it takes a long time. Noel
coughed a good bit after tea, and asked for Alice.

Oswald told him she was doing something and it was a secret. Oswald did
not tell any lies even to save his sister. When Alice came back she was
very quiet, but she whispered to Oswald that it was all right. When
it was rather late Eliza said she was going out to post a letter. This
always takes her an hour, because she _will_ go to the post-office
across the Heath instead of the pillar-box, because once a boy dropped
fusees in our pillar-box and burnt the letters. It was not any of us;
Eliza told us about it. And when there was a knock at the door a long
time after we thought it was Eliza come back, and that she had forgotten
the back-door key. We made H. O. go down to open the door, because it
is his place to run about: his legs are younger than ours. And we heard
boots on the stairs besides H. O.’s, and we listened spellbound till the
door opened, and it was Albert’s uncle. He looked very tired.

‘I am glad you’ve come,’ Oswald said. ‘Alice began to think Noel--’

Alice stopped me, and her face was very red, her nose was shiny too,
with having cried so much before tea.

She said, ‘I only said I thought Noel ought to have the doctor. Don’t
you think he ought?’ She got hold of Albert’s uncle and held on to him.

‘Let’s have a look at you, young man,’ said Albert’s uncle, and he sat
down on the edge of the bed. It is a rather shaky bed, the bar that
keeps it steady underneath got broken when we were playing burglars last
winter. It was our crowbar. He began to feel Noel’s pulse, and went on
talking.

‘It was revealed to the Arab physician as he made merry in his tents on
the wild plains of Hastings that the Presence had a cold in its head. So
he immediately seated himself on the magic carpet, and bade it bear him
hither, only pausing in the flight to purchase a few sweetmeats in the
bazaar.’

He pulled out a jolly lot of chocolate and some butterscotch, and grapes
for Noel. When we had all said thank you, he went on.

‘The physician’s are the words of wisdom: it’s high time this kid was
asleep. I have spoken. Ye have my leave to depart.’

So we bunked, and Dora and Albert’s uncle made Noel comfortable for the
night.

Then they came to the nursery which we had gone down to, and he sat down
in the Guy Fawkes chair and said, ‘Now then.’

Alice said, ‘You may tell them what I did. I daresay they’ll all be in a
wax, but I don’t care.’

‘I think you were very wise,’ said Albert’s uncle, pulling her close to
him to sit on his knee. ‘I am very glad you telegraphed.’

So then Oswald understood what Alice’s secret was. She had gone out and
sent a telegram to Albert’s uncle at Hastings. But Oswald thought she
might have told him. Afterwards she told me what she had put in the
telegram. It was, ‘Come home. We have given Noel a cold, and I think we
are killing him.’ With the address it came to tenpence-halfpenny.

Then Albert’s uncle began to ask questions, and it all came out,
how Dicky had tried to catch the cold, but the cold had gone to Noel
instead, and about the medicines and all. Albert’s uncle looked very
serious.

‘Look here,’ he said, ‘You’re old enough not to play the fool like this.
Health is the best thing you’ve got; you ought to know better than to
risk it. You might have killed your little brother with your precious
medicines. You’ve had a lucky escape, certainly. But poor Noel!’

‘Oh, do you think he’s going to die?’ Alice asked that, and she was
crying again.

‘No, no,’ said Albert’s uncle; ‘but look here. Do you see how silly
you’ve been? And I thought you promised your Father--’ And then he gave
us a long talking-to. He can make you feel most awfully small. At last
he stopped, and we said we were very sorry, and he said, ‘You know I
promised to take you all to the pantomime?’

So we said, ‘Yes,’ and knew but too well that now he wasn’t going to.
Then he went on--

‘Well, I will take you if you like, or I will take Noel to the sea for a
week to cure his cold. Which is it to be?’

Of course he knew we should say, ‘Take Noel’ and we did; but Dicky told
me afterwards he thought it was hard on H. O.

Albert’s uncle stayed till Eliza came in, and then he said good night in
a way that showed us that all was forgiven and forgotten.

And we went to bed. It must have been the middle of the night when
Oswald woke up suddenly, and there was Alice with her teeth chattering,
shaking him to wake him.

‘Oh, Oswald!’ she said, ‘I am so unhappy. Suppose I should die in the
night!’

Oswald told her to go to bed and not gas. But she said, ‘I must tell
you; I wish I’d told Albert’s uncle. I’m a thief, and if I die to-night
I know where thieves go to.’ So Oswald saw it was no good and he sat
up in bed and said--‘Go ahead.’ So Alice stood shivering and said--‘I
hadn’t enough money for the telegram, so I took the bad sixpence out of
the exchequer. And I paid for it with that and the fivepence I had. And
I wouldn’t tell you, because if you’d stopped me doing it I couldn’t
have borne it; and if you’d helped me you’d have been a thief too. Oh,
what shall I do?’

Oswald thought a minute, and then he said--

‘You’d better have told me. But I think it will be all right if we pay
it back. Go to bed. Cross with you? No, stupid! Only another time you’d
better not keep secrets.’

So she kissed Oswald, and he let her, and she went back to bed.

The next day Albert’s uncle took Noel away, before Oswald had time to
persuade Alice that we ought to tell him about the sixpence. Alice was
very unhappy, but not so much as in the night: you can be very miserable
in the night if you have done anything wrong and you happen to be awake.
I know this for a fact.

None of us had any money except Eliza, and she wouldn’t give us any
unless we said what for; and of course we could not do that because of
the honour of the family. And Oswald was anxious to get the sixpence to
give to the telegraph people because he feared that the badness of that
sixpence might have been found out, and that the police might come for
Alice at any moment. I don’t think I ever had such an unhappy day. Of
course we could have written to Albert’s uncle, but it would have taken
a long time, and every moment of delay added to Alice’s danger. We
thought and thought, but we couldn’t think of any way to get that
sixpence. It seems a small sum, but you see Alice’s liberty depended
on it. It was quite late in the afternoon when I met Mrs Leslie on the
Parade. She had a brown fur coat and a lot of yellow flowers in her
hands. She stopped to speak to me, and asked me how the Poet was. I told
her he had a cold, and I wondered whether she would lend me sixpence if
I asked her, but I could not make up my mind how to begin to say it. It
is a hard thing to say--much harder than you would think. She talked to
me for a bit, and then she suddenly got into a cab, and said--

‘I’d no idea it was so late,’ and told the man where to go. And just as
she started she shoved the yellow flowers through the window and said,
‘For the sick poet, with my love,’ and was driven off.

Gentle reader, I will not conceal from you what Oswald did. He knew all
about not disgracing the family, and he did not like doing what I am
going to say: and they were really Noel’s flowers, only he could not
have sent them to Hastings, and Oswald knew he would say ‘Yes’ if Oswald
asked him. Oswald sacrificed his family pride because of his little
sister’s danger. I do not say he was a noble boy--I just tell you what
he did, and you can decide for yourself about the nobleness.

He put on his oldest clothes--they’re much older than any you would
think he had if you saw him when he was tidy--and he took those yellow
chrysanthemums and he walked with them to Greenwich Station and waited
for the trains bringing people from London. He sold those flowers in
penny bunches and got tenpence. Then he went to the telegraph office at
Lewisham, and said to the lady there:

‘A little girl gave you a bad sixpence yesterday. Here are six good
pennies.’

The lady said she had not noticed it, and never mind, but Oswald knew
that ‘Honesty is the best Policy’, and he refused to take back the
pennies. So at last she said she should put them in the plate on Sunday.
She is a very nice lady. I like the way she does her hair.

Then Oswald went home to Alice and told her, and she hugged him, and
said he was a dear, good, kind boy, and he said ‘Oh, it’s all right.’

We bought peppermint bullseyes with the fourpence I had over, and the
others wanted to know where we got the money, but we would not tell.

Only afterwards when Noel came home we told him, because they were his
flowers, and he said it was quite right. He made some poetry about it. I
only remember one bit of it.

    The noble youth of high degree
    Consents to play a menial part,
    All for his sister Alice’s sake,
    Who was so dear to his faithful heart.

But Oswald himself has never bragged about it. We got no treasure out of
this, unless you count the peppermint bullseyes.



CHAPTER 13. THE ROBBER AND THE BURGLAR

A day or two after Noel came back from Hastings there was snow; it was
jolly. And we cleared it off the path. A man to do it is sixpence at
least, and you should always save when you can. A penny saved is a penny
earned. And then we thought it would be nice to clear it off the top of
the portico, where it lies so thick, and the edges as if they had been
cut with a knife. And just as we had got out of the landing-window on
to the portico, the Water Rates came up the path with his book that he
tears the thing out of that says how much you have got to pay, and the
little ink-bottle hung on to his buttonhole in case you should pay him.
Father says the Water Rates is a sensible man, and knows it is always
well to be prepared for whatever happens, however unlikely. Alice said
afterwards that she rather liked the Water Rates, really, and Noel said
he had a face like a good vizier, or the man who rewards the honest boy
for restoring the purse, but we did not think about these things at
the time, and as the Water Rates came up the steps, we shovelled down
a great square slab of snow like an avalanche--and it fell right on
his head. Two of us thought of it at the same moment, so it was quite a
large avalanche. And when the Water Rates had shaken himself he rang the
bell. It was Saturday, and Father was at home. We know now that it is
very wrong and ungentlemanly to shovel snow off porticoes on to the
Water Rates, or any other person, and we hope he did not catch a cold,
and we are very sorry. We apologized to the Water Rates when Father told
us to. We were all sent to bed for it.

We all deserved the punishment, because the others would have shovelled
down snow just as we did if they’d thought of it--only they are not
so quick at thinking of things as we are. And even quite wrong things
sometimes lead to adventures; as every one knows who has ever read about
pirates or highwaymen.

Eliza hates us to be sent to bed early, because it means her having to
bring meals up, and it means lighting the fire in Noel’s room ever so
much earlier than usual. He had to have a fire because he still had a
bit of a cold. But this particular day we got Eliza into a good temper
by giving her a horrid brooch with pretending amethysts in it, that an
aunt once gave to Alice, so Eliza brought up an extra scuttle of coals,
and when the greengrocer came with the potatoes (he is always late on
Saturdays) she got some chestnuts from him. So that when we heard Father
go out after his dinner, there was a jolly fire in Noel’s room, and
we were able to go in and be Red Indians in blankets most comfortably.
Eliza had gone out; she says she gets things cheaper on Saturday
nights. She has a great friend, who sells fish at a shop, and he is
very generous, and lets her have herrings for less than half the natural
price.

So we were all alone in the house; Pincher was out with Eliza, and we
talked about robbers. And Dora thought it would be a dreadful trade, but
Dicky said--

‘I think it would be very interesting. And you would only rob rich
people, and be very generous to the poor and needy, like Claude Duval.’
Dora said, ‘It is wrong to be a robber.’

‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘you would never know a happy hour. Think of trying
to sleep with the stolen jewels under your bed, and remembering all the
quantities of policemen and detectives that there are in the world!’

‘There are ways of being robbers that are not wrong,’ said Noel; ‘if you
can rob a robber it is a right act.’

‘But you can’t,’ said Dora; ‘he is too clever, and besides, it’s wrong
anyway.’

‘Yes you can, and it isn’t; and murdering him with boiling oil is a
right act, too, so there!’ said Noel. ‘What about Ali Baba? Now then!’
And we felt it was a score for Noel.

‘What would you do if there _was_ a robber?’ said Alice.

H. O. said he would kill him with boiling oil; but Alice explained that
she meant a real robber--now--this minute--in the house.

Oswald and Dicky did not say; but Noel said he thought it would only be
fair to ask the robber quite politely and quietly to go away, and then
if he didn’t you could deal with him.

Now what I am going to tell you is a very strange and wonderful thing,
and I hope you will be able to believe it. I should not, if a boy told
me, unless I knew him to be a man of honour, and perhaps not then unless
he gave his sacred word. But it is true, all the same, and it only shows
that the days of romance and daring deeds are not yet at an end.

Alice was just asking Noel _how_ he would deal with the robber who
wouldn’t go if he was asked politely and quietly, when we heard a noise
downstairs--quite a plain noise, not the kind of noise you fancy you
hear. It was like somebody moving a chair. We held our breath and
listened and then came another noise, like some one poking a fire.
Now, you remember there was no one _to_ poke a fire or move a chair
downstairs, because Eliza and Father were both out. They could not have
come in without our hearing them, because the front door is as hard to
shut as the back one, and whichever you go in by you have to give a slam
that you can hear all down the street.

H. O. and Alice and Dora caught hold of each other’s blankets and looked
at Dicky and Oswald, and every one was quite pale. And Noel whispered--

‘It’s ghosts, I know it is’--and then we listened again, but there was
no more noise. Presently Dora said in a whisper--

‘Whatever shall we do? Oh, whatever shall we do--what _shall_ we do?’
And she kept on saying it till we had to tell her to shut up.

O reader, have you ever been playing Red Indians in blankets round a
bedroom fire in a house where you thought there was no one but you--and
then suddenly heard a noise like a chair, and a fire being poked,
downstairs? Unless you have you will not be able to imagine at all what
it feels like. It was not like in books; our hair did not stand on end
at all, and we never said ‘Hist!’ once, but our feet got very cold,
though we were in blankets by the fire, and the insides of Oswald’s
hands got warm and wet, and his nose was cold like a dog’s, and his ears
were burning hot.

The girls said afterwards that they shivered with terror, and their
teeth chattered, but we did not see or hear this at the time.

‘Shall we open the window and call police?’ said Dora; and then Oswald
suddenly thought of something, and he breathed more freely and he said--

‘I _know_ it’s not ghosts, and I don’t believe it’s robbers. I expect
it’s a stray cat got in when the coals came this morning, and she’s
been hiding in the cellar, and now she’s moving about. Let’s go down and
see.’

The girls wouldn’t, of course; but I could see that they breathed more
freely too. But Dicky said, ‘All right; I will if you will.’

H. O. said, ‘Do you think it’s _really_ a cat?’ So we said he had better
stay with the girls. And of course after that we had to let him and
Alice both come. Dora said if we took Noel down with his cold, she would
scream ‘Fire!’ and ‘Murder!’ and she didn’t mind if the whole street
heard.

So Noel agreed to be getting his clothes on, and the rest of us said we
would go down and look for the cat.

Now Oswald _said_ that about the cat, and it made it easier to go down,
but in his inside he did not feel at all sure that it might not be
robbers after all. Of course, we had often talked about robbers before,
but it is very different when you sit in a room and listen and listen
and listen; and Oswald felt somehow that it would be easier to go down
and see what it was, than to wait, and listen, and wait, and wait, and
listen, and wait, and then perhaps to hear _it_, whatever it was, come
creeping slowly up the stairs as softly as _it_ could with _its_ boots
off, and the stairs creaking, towards the room where we were with the
door open in case of Eliza coming back suddenly, and all dark on the
landings. And then it would have been just as bad, and it would have
lasted longer, and you would have known you were a coward besides. Dicky
says he felt all these same things. Many people would say we were young
heroes to go down as we did; so I have tried to explain, because no
young hero wishes to have more credit than he deserves.

The landing gas was turned down low--just a blue bead--and we four went
out very softly, wrapped in our blankets, and we stood on the top of the
stairs a good long time before we began to go down. And we listened and
listened till our ears buzzed.

And Oswald whispered to Dicky, and Dicky went into our room and fetched
the large toy pistol that is a foot long, and that has the trigger
broken, and I took it because I am the eldest; and I don’t think either
of us thought it was the cat now. But Alice and H. O. did. Dicky got the
poker out of Noel’s room, and told Dora it was to settle the cat with
when we caught her.

Then Oswald whispered, ‘Let’s play at burglars; Dicky and I are armed
to the teeth, we will go first. You keep a flight behind us, and be
a reinforcement if we are attacked. Or you can retreat and defend the
women and children in the fortress, if you’d rather.’

But they said they would be a reinforcement.

Oswald’s teeth chattered a little when he spoke. It was not with
anything else except cold.

So Dicky and Oswald crept down, and when we got to the bottom of the
stairs, we saw Father’s study door just ajar, and the crack of light.
And Oswald was so pleased to see the light, knowing that burglars prefer
the dark, or at any rate the dark lantern, that he felt really sure it
_was_ the cat after all, and then he thought it would be fun to make
the others upstairs think it was really a robber. So he cocked the
pistol--you can cock it, but it doesn’t go off--and he said, ‘Come on,
Dick!’ and he rushed at the study door and burst into the room, crying,
‘Surrender! you are discovered! Surrender, or I fire! Throw up your
hands!’

And, as he finished saying it, he saw before him, standing on the study
hearthrug, a Real Robber. There was no mistake about it. Oswald was
sure it was a robber, because it had a screwdriver in its hands, and was
standing near the cupboard door that H. O. broke the lock off; and there
were gimlets and screws and things on the floor. There is nothing in
that cupboard but old ledgers and magazines and the tool chest, but of
course, a robber could not know that beforehand.

When Oswald saw that there really was a robber, and that he was so
heavily armed with the screwdriver, he did not feel comfortable. But he
kept the pistol pointed at the robber, and--you will hardly believe it,
but it is true--the robber threw down the screwdriver clattering on the
other tools, and he _did_ throw up his hands, and said--

‘I surrender; don’t shoot me! How many of you are there?’

So Dicky said, ‘You are outnumbered. Are you armed?’

And the robber said, ‘No, not in the least.’

And Oswald said, still pointing the pistol, and feeling very strong and
brave and as if he was in a book, ‘Turn out your pockets.’

The robber did: and while he turned them out, we looked at him. He was
of the middle height, and clad in a black frock-coat and grey trousers.
His boots were a little gone at the sides, and his shirt-cuffs were
a bit frayed, but otherwise he was of gentlemanly demeanour. He had a
thin, wrinkled face, with big, light eyes that sparkled, and then looked
soft very queerly, and a short beard. In his youth it must have been of
a fair golden colour, but now it was tinged with grey. Oswald was sorry
for him, especially when he saw that one of his pockets had a large hole
in it, and that he had nothing in his pockets but letters and string and
three boxes of matches, and a pipe and a handkerchief and a thin tobacco
pouch and two pennies. We made him put all the things on the table, and
then he said--

‘Well, you’ve caught me; what are you going to do with me? Police?’

Alice and H. O. had come down to be reinforcements, when they heard a
shout, and when Alice saw that it was a Real Robber, and that he had
surrendered, she clapped her hands and said, ‘Bravo, boys!’ and so did
H. O. And now she said, ‘If he gives his word of honour not to escape,
I shouldn’t call the police: it seems a pity. Wait till Father comes
home.’

The robber agreed to this, and gave his word of honour, and asked if he
might put on a pipe, and we said ‘Yes,’ and he sat in Father’s armchair
and warmed his boots, which steamed, and I sent H. O. and Alice to
put on some clothes and tell the others, and bring down Dicky’s and my
knickerbockers, and the rest of the chestnuts.

And they all came, and we sat round the fire, and it was jolly. The
robber was very friendly, and talked to us a great deal.

‘I wasn’t always in this low way of business,’ he said, when Noel said
something about the things he had turned out of his pockets. ‘It’s
a great come-down to a man like me. But, if I must be caught, it’s
something to be caught by brave young heroes like you. My stars! How you
did bolt into the room,--“Surrender, and up with your hands!” You might
have been born and bred to the thief-catching.’

Oswald is sorry if it was mean, but he could not own up just then that
he did not think there was any one in the study when he did that brave
if rash act. He has told since.

‘And what made you think there was any one in the house?’ the robber
asked, when he had thrown his head back, and laughed for quite half a
minute. So we told him. And he applauded our valour, and Alice and H.
O. explained that they would have said ‘Surrender,’ too, only they were
reinforcements. The robber ate some of the chestnuts--and we sat and
wondered when Father would come home, and what he would say to us for
our intrepid conduct. And the robber told us of all the things he had
done before he began to break into houses. Dicky picked up the tools
from the floor, and suddenly he said--

‘Why, this is Father’s screwdriver and his gimlets, and all! Well, I do
call it jolly cheek to pick a man’s locks with his own tools!’

‘True, true,’ said the robber. ‘It is cheek, of the jolliest! But you
see I’ve come down in the world. I was a highway robber once, but
horses are so expensive to hire--five shillings an hour, you know--and
I couldn’t afford to keep them. The highwayman business isn’t what it
was.’

‘What about a bike?’ said H. O.

But the robber thought cycles were low--and besides you couldn’t go
across country with them when occasion arose, as you could with a trusty
steed. And he talked of highwaymen as if he knew just how we liked
hearing it.

Then he told us how he had been a pirate captain--and how he had sailed
over waves mountains high, and gained rich prizes--and how he _did_
begin to think that here he had found a profession to his mind.

‘I don’t say there are no ups and downs in it,’ he said, ‘especially
in stormy weather. But what a trade! And a sword at your side, and the
Jolly Roger flying at the peak, and a prize in sight. And all the black
mouths of your guns pointed at the laden trader--and the wind in your
favour, and your trusty crew ready to live and die for you! Oh--but it’s
a grand life!’

I did feel so sorry for him. He used such nice words, and he had a
gentleman’s voice.

‘I’m sure you weren’t brought up to be a pirate,’ said Dora. She had
dressed even to her collar--and made Noel do it too--but the rest of us
were in blankets with just a few odd things put on anyhow underneath.

The robber frowned and sighed.

‘No,’ he said, ‘I was brought up to the law. I was at Balliol, bless
your hearts, and that’s true anyway.’ He sighed again, and looked hard
at the fire.

‘That was my Father’s college,’ H. O. was beginning, but Dicky
said--‘Why did you leave off being a pirate?’

‘A pirate?’ he said, as if he had not been thinking of such things.

‘Oh, yes; why I gave it up because--because I could not get over the
dreadful sea-sickness.’

‘Nelson was sea-sick,’ said Oswald.

‘Ah,’ said the robber; ‘but I hadn’t his luck or his pluck, or
something. He stuck to it and won Trafalgar, didn’t he? “Kiss me,
Hardy”--and all that, eh? _I_ couldn’t stick to it--I had to resign. And
nobody kissed _me_.’

I saw by his understanding about Nelson that he was really a man who had
been to a good school as well as to Balliol.

Then we asked him, ‘And what did you do then?’

And Alice asked if he was ever a coiner, and we told him how we had
thought we’d caught the desperate gang next door, and he was very much
interested and said he was glad he had never taken to coining.

‘Besides, the coins are so ugly nowadays,’ he said, ‘no one could really
find any pleasure in making them. And it’s a hole-and-corner business
at the best, isn’t it?--and it must be a very thirsty one--with the hot
metal and furnaces and things.’

And again he looked at the fire.

Oswald forgot for a minute that the interesting stranger was a robber,
and asked him if he wouldn’t have a drink. Oswald has heard Father do
this to his friends, so he knows it is the right thing. The robber said
he didn’t mind if he did. And that is right, too.

And Dora went and got a bottle of Father’s ale--the Light Sparkling
Family--and a glass, and we gave it to the robber. Dora said she would
be responsible.

Then when he had had a drink he told us about bandits, but he said it
was so bad in wet weather. Bandits’ caves were hardly ever properly
weathertight. And bush-ranging was the same.

‘As a matter of fact,’ he said, ‘I was bush-ranging this afternoon,
among the furze-bushes on the Heath, but I had no luck. I stopped the
Lord Mayor in his gilt coach, with all his footmen in plush and gold
lace, smart as cockatoos. But it was no go. The Lord Mayor hadn’t a
stiver in his pockets. One of the footmen had six new pennies: the Lord
Mayor always pays his servants’ wages in new pennies. I spent fourpence
of that in bread and cheese, that on the table’s the tuppence. Ah, it’s
a poor trade!’ And then he filled his pipe again.

We had turned out the gas, so that Father should have a jolly good
surprise when he did come home, and we sat and talked as pleasant as
could be. I never liked a new man better than I liked that robber. And I
felt so sorry for him. He told us he had been a war-correspondent and
an editor, in happier days, as well as a horse-stealer and a colonel of
dragoons.

And quite suddenly, just as we were telling him about Lord Tottenham and
our being highwaymen ourselves, he put up his hand and said ‘Shish!’ and
we were quiet and listened.

There was a scrape, scrape, scraping noise; it came from downstairs.

‘They’re filing something,’ whispered the robber, ‘here--shut up, give
me that pistol, and the poker. There is a burglar now, and no mistake.’

‘It’s only a toy one and it won’t go off,’ I said, ‘but you can cock
it.’

Then we heard a snap. ‘There goes the window bar,’ said the robber
softly. ‘Jove! what an adventure! You kids stay here, I’ll tackle it.’

But Dicky and I said we should come. So he let us go as far as the
bottom of the kitchen stairs, and we took the tongs and shovel with us.
There was a light in the kitchen; a very little light. It is curious we
never thought, any of us, that this might be a plant of our robber’s to
get away. We never thought of doubting his word of honour. And we were
right.

That noble robber dashed the kitchen door open, and rushed in with the
big toy pistol in one hand and the poker in the other, shouting out just
like Oswald had done--

‘Surrender! You are discovered! Surrender, or I’ll fire! Throw up your
hands!’ And Dicky and I rattled the tongs and shovel so that he might
know there were more of us, all bristling with weapons.

And we heard a husky voice in the kitchen saying--

‘All right, governor! Stow that scent sprinkler. I’ll give in. Blowed if
I ain’t pretty well sick of the job, anyway.’

Then we went in. Our robber was standing in the grandest manner with his
legs very wide apart, and the pistol pointing at the cowering burglar.
The burglar was a large man who did not mean to have a beard, I think,
but he had got some of one, and a red comforter, and a fur cap, and his
face was red and his voice was thick. How different from our own robber!
The burglar had a dark lantern, and he was standing by the plate-basket.
When we had lit the gas we all thought he was very like what a burglar
ought to be.

He did not look as if he could ever have been a pirate or a highwayman,
or anything really dashing or noble, and he scowled and shuffled his
feet and said: ‘Well, go on: why don’t yer fetch the pleece?’

‘Upon my word, I don’t know,’ said our robber, rubbing his chin.
‘Oswald, why don’t we fetch the police?’

It is not every robber that I would stand Christian names from, I can
tell you but just then I didn’t think of that. I just said--‘Do you mean
I’m to fetch one?’

Our robber looked at the burglar and said nothing.

Then the burglar began to speak very fast, and to look different ways
with his hard, shiny little eyes.

‘Lookee ‘ere, governor,’ he said, ‘I was stony broke, so help me, I
was. And blessed if I’ve nicked a haporth of your little lot. You know
yourself there ain’t much to tempt a bloke,’ he shook the plate-basket
as if he was angry with it, and the yellowy spoons and forks rattled. ‘I
was just a-looking through this ‘ere Bank-ollerday show, when you come.
Let me off, sir. Come now, I’ve got kids of my own at home, strike me
if I ain’t--same as yours--I’ve got a nipper just about ‘is size, and
what’ll come of them if I’m lagged? I ain’t been in it long, sir, and I
ain’t ‘andy at it.’

‘No,’ said our robber; ‘you certainly are not.’ Alice and the others
had come down by now to see what was happening. Alice told me afterwards
they thought it really was the cat this time.

‘No, I ain’t ‘andy, as you say, sir, and if you let me off this once
I’ll chuck the whole blooming bizz; rake my civvy, I will. Don’t be hard
on a cove, mister; think of the missis and the kids. I’ve got one just
the cut of little missy there bless ‘er pretty ‘eart.’

‘Your family certainly fits your circumstances very nicely,’ said our
robber. Then Alice said--

‘Oh, do let him go! If he’s got a little girl like me, whatever will she
do? Suppose it was Father!’

‘I don’t think he’s got a little girl like you, my dear,’ said our
robber, ‘and I think he’ll be safer under lock and key.’

‘You ask yer Father to let me go, miss,’ said the burglar; ‘’e won’t
‘ave the ‘art to refuse you.’

‘If I do,’ said Alice, ‘will you promise never to come back?’

‘Not me, miss,’ the burglar said very earnestly, and he looked at the
plate-basket again, as if that alone would be enough to keep him away,
our robber said afterwards.

‘And will you be good and not rob any more?’ said Alice.

‘I’ll turn over a noo leaf, miss, so help me.’

Then Alice said--‘Oh, do let him go! I’m sure he’ll be good.’

But our robber said no, it wouldn’t be right; we must wait till Father
came home. Then H. O. said, very suddenly and plainly:

‘I don’t think it’s at all fair, when you’re a robber yourself.’

The minute he’d said it the burglar said, ‘Kidded, by gum!’--and then
our robber made a step towards him to catch hold of him, and before you
had time to think ‘Hullo!’ the burglar knocked the pistol up with one
hand and knocked our robber down with the other, and was off out of
the window like a shot, though Oswald and Dicky did try to stop him by
holding on to his legs.

And that burglar had the cheek to put his head in at the window and say,
‘I’ll give yer love to the kids and the missis’--and he was off like
winking, and there were Alice and Dora trying to pick up our robber, and
asking him whether he was hurt, and where. He wasn’t hurt at all, except
a lump at the back of his head. And he got up, and we dusted the kitchen
floor off him. Eliza is a dirty girl.

Then he said, ‘Let’s put up the shutters. It never rains but it pours.
Now you’ve had two burglars I daresay you’ll have twenty.’ So we put up
the shutters, which Eliza has strict orders to do before she goes out,
only she never does, and we went back to Father’s study, and the robber
said, ‘What a night we are having!’ and put his boots back in the fender
to go on steaming, and then we all talked at once. It was the most
wonderful adventure we ever had, though it wasn’t treasure-seeking--at
least not ours. I suppose it was the burglar’s treasure-seeking, but
he didn’t get much--and our robber said he didn’t believe a word about
those kids that were so like Alice and me.

And then there was the click of the gate, and we said, ‘Here’s Father,’
and the robber said, ‘And now for the police.’

Then we all jumped up. We did like him so much, and it seemed so unfair
that he should be sent to prison, and the horrid, lumping big burglar
not.

And Alice said, ‘Oh, _no_--run! Dicky will let you out at the back door.
Oh, do go, go _now_.’

And we all said, ‘Yes, _go_,’ and pulled him towards the door, and gave
him his hat and stick and the things out of his pockets.

But Father’s latchkey was in the door, and it was too late.

Father came in quickly, purring with the cold, and began to say, ‘It’s
all right, Foulkes, I’ve got--’ And then he stopped short and stared
at us. Then he said, in the voice we all hate, ‘Children, what is the
meaning of all this?’ And for a minute nobody spoke.

Then my Father said, ‘Foulkes, I must really apologize for these very
naughty--’ And then our robber rubbed his hands and laughed, and cried
out:

‘You’re mistaken, my dear sir, I’m not Foulkes; I’m a robber, captured
by these young people in the most gallant manner. “Hands up, surrender,
or I fire,” and all the rest of it. My word, Bastable, but you’ve got
some kids worth having! I wish my Denny had their pluck.’

Then we began to understand, and it was like being knocked down, it was
so sudden. And our robber told us he wasn’t a robber after all. He was
only an old college friend of my Father’s, and he had come after dinner,
when Father was just trying to mend the lock H. O. had broken, to ask
Father to get him a letter to a doctor about his little boy Denny, who
was ill. And Father had gone over the Heath to Vanbrugh Park to see some
rich people he knows and get the letter. And he had left Mr Foulkes to
wait till he came back, because it was important to know at once whether
Father could get the letter, and if he couldn’t Mr Foulkes would have
had to try some one else directly.

We were dumb with amazement.

Our robber told my Father about the other burglar, and said he was
sorry he’d let him escape, but my Father said, ‘Oh, it’s all right: poor
beggar; if he really had kids at home: you never can tell--forgive us
our debts, don’t you know; but tell me about the first business. It must
have been moderately entertaining.’

Then our robber told my Father how I had rushed into the room with a
pistol, crying out... but you know all about that. And he laid it on
so thick and fat about plucky young-uns, and chips of old blocks, and
things like that, that I felt I was purple with shame, even under the
blanket. So I swallowed that thing that tries to prevent you speaking
when you ought to, and I said, ‘Look here, Father, I didn’t really think
there was any one in the study. We thought it was a cat at first, and
then I thought there was no one there, and I was just larking. And when
I said surrender and all that, it was just the game, don’t you know?’

Then our robber said, ‘Yes, old chap; but when you found there really
_was_ someone there, you dropped the pistol and bunked, didn’t you, eh?’

And I said, ‘No; I thought, “Hullo! here’s a robber! Well, it’s all up,
I suppose, but I may as well hold on and see what happens.”’

And I was glad I’d owned up, for Father slapped me on the back, and
said I was a young brick, and our robber said I was no funk anyway, and
though I got very hot under the blanket I liked it, and I explained that
the others would have done the same if they had thought of it.

Then Father got up some more beer, and laughed about Dora’s
responsibility, and he got out a box of figs he had bought for us, only
he hadn’t given it to us because of the Water Rates, and Eliza came in
and brought up the bread and cheese, and what there was left of the
neck of mutton--cold wreck of mutton, Father called it--and we had a
feast--like a picnic--all sitting anywhere, and eating with our fingers.
It was prime. We sat up till past twelve o’clock, and I never felt so
pleased to think I was not born a girl. It was hard on the others; they
would have done just the same if they’d thought of it. But it does make
you feel jolly when your pater says you’re a young brick!

When Mr Foulkes was going, he said to Alice, ‘Good-bye, Hardy.’

And Alice understood, of course, and kissed him as hard as she could.

And she said, ‘I wanted to, when you said no one kissed you when you
left off being a pirate.’ And he said, ‘I know you did, my dear.’ And
Dora kissed him too, and said, ‘I suppose none of these tales were
true?’

And our robber just said, ‘I tried to play the part properly, my dear.’

And he jolly well did play it, and no mistake. We have often seen him
since, and his boy Denny, and his girl Daisy, but that comes in another
story.

And if any of you kids who read this ever had two such adventures in one
night you can just write and tell me. That’s all.



CHAPTER 14. THE DIVINING-ROD

You have no idea how uncomfortable the house was on the day when we
sought for gold with the divining-rod. It was like a spring-cleaning in
the winter-time. All the carpets were up, because Father had told Eliza
to make the place decent as there was a gentleman coming to dinner the
next day. So she got in a charwoman, and they slopped water about, and
left brooms and brushes on the stairs for people to tumble over. H. O.
got a big bump on his head in that way, and when he said it was too bad,
Eliza said he should keep in the nursery then, and not be where he’d no
business. We bandaged his head with a towel, and then he stopped crying
and played at being England’s wounded hero dying in the cockpit, while
every man was doing his duty, as the hero had told them to, and Alice
was Hardy, and I was the doctor, and the others were the crew. Playing
at Hardy made us think of our own dear robber, and we wished he was
there, and wondered if we should ever see him any more.

We were rather astonished at Father’s having anyone to dinner, because
now he never seems to think of anything but business. Before Mother died
people often came to dinner, and Father’s business did not take up so
much of his time and was not the bother it is now. And we used to see
who could go furthest down in our nightgowns and get nice things to
eat, without being seen, out of the dishes as they came out of the
dining-room. Eliza can’t cook very nice things. She told Father she was
a good plain cook, but he says it was a fancy portrait. We stayed in the
nursery till the charwoman came in and told us to be off--she was going
to make one job of it, and have our carpet up as well as all the
others, now the man was here to beat them. It came up, and it was very
dusty--and under it we found my threepenny-bit that I lost ages ago,
which shows what Eliza is. H. O. had got tired of being the wounded
hero, and Dicky was so tired of doing nothing that Dora said she knew
he’d begin to tease Noel in a minute; then of course Dicky said he
wasn’t going to tease anybody--he was going out to the Heath. He said
he’d heard that nagging women drove a man from his home, and now he
found it was quite true. Oswald always tries to be a peacemaker, so he
told Dicky to shut up and not make an ass of himself. And Alice said,
‘Well, Dora began’--And Dora tossed her chin up and said it wasn’t any
business of Oswald’s any way, and no one asked Alice’s opinion. So we
all felt very uncomfortable till Noel said, ‘Don’t let’s quarrel about
nothing. You know let dogs delight--and I made up another piece while
you were talking--

    Quarrelling is an evil thing,
    It fills with gall life’s cup;
    For when once you begin
    It takes such a long time to make it up.’

We all laughed then and stopped jawing at each other. Noel is very funny
with his poetry. But that piece happened to come out quite true. You
begin to quarrel and then you can’t stop; often, long before the others
are ready to cry and make it up, I see how silly it is, and I want to
laugh; but it doesn’t do to say so--for it only makes the others crosser
than they were before. I wonder why that is?

Alice said Noel ought to be poet laureate, and she actually went out
in the cold and got some laurel leaves--the spotted kind--out of
the garden, and Dora made a crown and we put it on him. He was quite
pleased; but the leaves made a mess, and Eliza said, ‘Don’t.’ I believe
that’s a word grown-ups use more than any other. Then suddenly Alice
thought of that old idea of hers for finding treasure, and she said--‘Do
let’s try the divining-rod.’

So Oswald said, ‘Fair priestess, we do greatly desire to find gold
beneath our land, therefore we pray thee practise with the divining-rod,
and tell us where we can find it.’

‘Do ye desire to fashion of it helms and hauberks?’ said Alice.

‘Yes,’ said Noel; ‘and chains and ouches.’

‘I bet you don’t know what an “ouch” is,’ said Dicky.

‘Yes I do, so there!’ said Noel. ‘It’s a carcanet. I looked it out in
the dicker, now then!’ We asked him what a carcanet was, but he wouldn’t
say.

‘And we want to make fair goblets of the gold,’ said Oswald.

‘Yes, to drink coconut milk out of,’ said H. O.

‘And we desire to build fair palaces of it,’ said Dicky.

‘And to buy things,’ said Dora; ‘a great many things. New Sunday frocks
and hats and kid gloves and--’

She would have gone on for ever so long only we reminded her that we
hadn’t found the gold yet.

By this Alice had put on the nursery tablecloth, which is green, and
tied the old blue and yellow antimacassar over her head, and she said--

‘If your intentions are correct, fear nothing and follow me.’

And she went down into the hall. We all followed chanting ‘Heroes.’ It
is a gloomy thing the girls learnt at the High School, and we always use
it when we want a priestly chant.

Alice stopped short by the hat-stand, and held up her hands as well as
she could for the tablecloth, and said--

‘Now, great altar of the golden idol, yield me the divining-rod that I
may use it for the good of the suffering people.’

The umbrella-stand was the altar of the golden idol, and it yielded her
the old school umbrella. She carried it between her palms.

‘Now,’ she said, ‘I shall sing the magic chant. You mustn’t say
anything, but just follow wherever I go--like follow my leader, you
know--and when there is gold underneath the magic rod will twist in the
hand of the priestess like a live thing that seeks to be free. Then you
will dig, and the golden treasure will be revealed. H. O., if you make
that clatter with your boots they’ll come and tell us not to. Now come
on all of you.’

So she went upstairs and down and into every room. We followed her
on tiptoe, and Alice sang as she went. What she sang is not out of a
book--Noel made it up while she was dressing up for the priestess.

    Ashen rod cold
    That here I hold,
    Teach me where to find the gold.

When we came to where Eliza was, she said, ‘Get along with you’; but
Dora said it was only a game, and we wouldn’t touch anything, and our
boots were quite clean, and Eliza might as well let us. So she did.

It was all right for the priestess, but it was a little dull for the
rest of us, because she wouldn’t let us sing, too; so we said we’d had
enough of it, and if she couldn’t find the gold we’d leave off and play
something else. The priestess said, ‘All right, wait a minute,’ and went
on singing. Then we all followed her back into the nursery, where the
carpet was up and the boards smelt of soft soap. Then she said, ‘It
moves, it moves! Once more the choral hymn!’ So we sang ‘Heroes’ again,
and in the middle the umbrella dropped from her hands.

‘The magic rod has spoken,’ said Alice; ‘dig here, and that with courage
and despatch.’ We didn’t quite see how to dig, but we all began to
scratch on the floor with our hands, but the priestess said, ‘Don’t
be so silly! It’s the place where they come to do the gas. The board’s
loose. Dig an you value your lives, for ere sundown the dragon who
guards this spoil will return in his fiery fury and make you his
unresisting prey.’

So we dug--that is, we got the loose board up. And Alice threw up her
arms and cried--

‘See the rich treasure--the gold in thick layers, with silver and
diamonds stuck in it!’

‘Like currants in cake,’ said H. O.

‘It’s a lovely treasure,’ said Dicky yawning. ‘Let’s come back and carry
it away another day.’

But Alice was kneeling by the hole.

‘Let me feast my eyes on the golden splendour,’ she said, ‘hidden these
long centuries from the human eye. Behold how the magic rod has led
us to treasures more--Oswald, don’t push so!--more bright than ever
monarch--I say, there _is_ something down there, really. I saw it
shine!’

We thought she was kidding, but when she began to try to get into the
hole, which was much too small, we saw she meant it, so I said, ‘Let’s
have a squint,’ and I looked, but I couldn’t see anything, even when I
lay down on my stomach. The others lay down on their stomachs too and
tried to see, all but Noel, who stood and looked at us and said we were
the great serpents come down to drink at the magic pool. He wanted to be
the knight and slay the great serpents with his good sword--he even drew
the umbrella ready--but Alice said, ‘All right, we will in a minute. But
now--I’m sure I saw it; do get a match, Noel, there’s a dear.’

‘What did you see?’ asked Noel, beginning to go for the matches very
slowly.

‘Something bright, away in the corner under the board against the beam.’

‘Perhaps it was a rat’s eye,’ Noel said, ‘or a snake’s,’ and we did
not put our heads quite so close to the hole till he came back with the
matches.

Then I struck a match, and Alice cried, ‘There it is!’ And there it was,
and it was a half-sovereign, partly dusty and partly bright. We think
perhaps a mouse, disturbed by the carpets being taken up, may have
brushed the dust of years from part of the half-sovereign with his tail.
We can’t imagine how it came there, only Dora thinks she remembers once
when H. O. was very little Mother gave him some money to hold, and he
dropped it, and it rolled all over the floor. So we think perhaps this
was part of it. We were very glad. H. O. wanted to go out at once and
buy a mask he had seen for fourpence. It had been a shilling mask, but
now it was going very cheap because Guy Fawkes’ Day was over, and it was
a little cracked at the top. But Dora said, ‘I don’t know that it’s our
money. Let’s wait and ask Father.’

But H. O. did not care about waiting, and I felt for him. Dora is rather
like grown-ups in that way; she does not seem to understand that when
you want a thing you do want it, and that you don’t wish to wait, even a
minute.

So we went and asked Albert-next-door’s uncle. He was pegging away at
one of the rotten novels he has to write to make his living, but he said
we weren’t interrupting him at all.

‘My hero’s folly has involved him in a difficulty,’ he said. ‘It is his
own fault. I will leave him to meditate on the incredible fatuity--the
hare-brained recklessness--which have brought him to this pass. It will
be a lesson to him. I, meantime, will give myself unreservedly to the
pleasures of your conversation.’

That’s one thing I like Albert’s uncle for. He always talks like a book,
and yet you can always understand what he means. I think he is more like
us, inside of his mind, than most grown-up people are. He can pretend
beautifully. I never met anyone else so good at it, except our robber,
and we began it, with him. But it was Albert’s uncle who first taught
us how to make people talk like books when you’re playing things, and he
made us learn to tell a story straight from the beginning, not starting
in the middle like most people do. So now Oswald remembered what he had
been told, as he generally does, and began at the beginning, but when he
came to where Alice said she was the priestess, Albert’s uncle said--

‘Let the priestess herself set forth the tale in fitting speech.’

So Alice said, ‘O high priest of the great idol, the humblest of thy
slaves took the school umbrella for a divining-rod, and sang the song of
inver--what’s-it’s-name?’

‘Invocation perhaps?’ said Albert’s uncle. ‘Yes; and then I went about
and about and the others got tired, so the divining-rod fell on a
certain spot, and I said, “Dig”, and we dug--it was where the loose
board is for the gas men--and then there really and truly was a
half-sovereign lying under the boards, and here it is.’

Albert’s uncle took it and looked at it.

‘The great high priest will bite it to see if it’s good,’ he said, and
he did. ‘I congratulate you,’ he went on; ‘you are indeed among those
favoured by the Immortals. First you find half-crowns in the garden, and
now this. The high priest advises you to tell your Father, and ask if
you may keep it. My hero has become penitent, but impatient. I must pull
him out of this scrape. Ye have my leave to depart.’

Of course we know from Kipling that that means, ‘You’d better bunk, and
be sharp about it,’ so we came away. I do like Albert’s uncle.

I shall be like that when I’m a man. He gave us our Jungle books, and he
is awfully clever, though he does have to write grown-up tales.

We told Father about it that night. He was very kind. He said we
might certainly have the half-sovereign, and he hoped we should enjoy
ourselves with our treasure-trove.

Then he said, ‘Your dear Mother’s Indian Uncle is coming to dinner here
to-morrow night. So will you not drag the furniture about overhead,
please, more than you’re absolutely obliged; and H. O. might wear
slippers or something. I can always distinguish the note of H. O.’s
boots.’

We said we would be very quiet, and Father went on--

‘This Indian Uncle is not used to children, and he is coming to talk
business with me. It is really important that he should be quiet. Do you
think, Dora, that perhaps bed at six for H. O. and Noel--’

But H. O. said, ‘Father, I really and truly won’t make a noise. I’ll
stand on my head all the evening sooner than disturb the Indian Uncle
with my boots.’

And Alice said Noel never made a row anyhow. So Father laughed and
said, ‘All right.’ And he said we might do as we liked with the
half-sovereign. ‘Only for goodness’ sake don’t try to go in for business
with it,’ he said. ‘It’s always a mistake to go into business with an
insufficient capital.’

We talked it over all that evening, and we decided that as we were not
to go into business with our half-sovereign it was no use not spending
it at once, and so we might as well have a right royal feast. The next
day we went out and bought the things. We got figs, and almonds and
raisins, and a real raw rabbit, and Eliza promised to cook it for us
if we would wait till tomorrow, because of the Indian Uncle coming to
dinner. She was very busy cooking nice things for him to eat. We got the
rabbit because we are so tired of beef and mutton, and Father hasn’t
a bill at the poultry shop. And we got some flowers to go on the
dinner-table for Father’s party. And we got hardbake and raspberry noyau
and peppermint rock and oranges and a coconut, with other nice things.
We put it all in the top long drawer. It is H. O.’s play drawer, and we
made him turn his things out and put them in Father’s old portmanteau.
H. O. is getting old enough now to learn to be unselfish, and besides,
his drawer wanted tidying very badly. Then we all vowed by the honour of
the ancient House of Bastable that we would not touch any of the
feast till Dora gave the word next day. And we gave H. O. some of the
hardbake, to make it easier for him to keep his vow. The next day was
the most rememorable day in all our lives, but we didn’t know that then.
But that is another story. I think that is such a useful way to know
when you can’t think how to end up a chapter. I learnt it from another
writer named Kipling. I’ve mentioned him before, I believe, but he
deserves it!



CHAPTER 15. ‘LO, THE POOR INDIAN!’

It was all very well for Father to ask us not to make a row because the
Indian Uncle was coming to talk business, but my young brother’s boots
are not the only things that make a noise. We took his boots away and
made him wear Dora’s bath slippers, which are soft and woolly, and
hardly any soles to them; and of course we wanted to see the Uncle,
so we looked over the banisters when he came, and we were as quiet
as mice--but when Eliza had let him in she went straight down to the
kitchen and made the most awful row you ever heard, it sounded like the
Day of judgement, or all the saucepans and crockery in the house being
kicked about the floor, but she told me afterwards it was only the
tea-tray and one or two cups and saucers, that she had knocked over in
her flurry. We heard the Uncle say, ‘God bless my soul!’ and then
he went into Father’s study and the door was shut--we didn’t see him
properly at all that time.

I don’t believe the dinner was very nice. Something got burned I’m
sure--for we smelt it. It was an extra smell, besides the mutton.

I know that got burned. Eliza wouldn’t have any of us in the kitchen
except Dora--till dinner was over. Then we got what was left of the
dessert, and had it on the stairs--just round the corner where they
can’t see you from the hall, unless the first landing gas is lighted.
Suddenly the study door opened and the Uncle came out and went and felt
in his greatcoat pocket. It was his cigar-case he wanted. We saw that
afterwards. We got a much better view of him then. He didn’t look like
an Indian but just like a kind of brown, big Englishman, and of course
he didn’t see us, but we heard him mutter to himself--

‘Shocking bad dinner! Eh!--what?’

When he went back to the study he didn’t shut the door properly. That
door has always been a little tiresome since the day we took the lock
off to get out the pencil sharpener H. O. had shoved into the keyhole.
We didn’t listen--really and truly--but the Indian Uncle has a very big
voice, and Father was not going to be beaten by a poor Indian in talking
or anything else--so he spoke up too, like a man, and I heard him say it
was a very good business, and only wanted a little capital--and he said
it as if it was an imposition he had learned, and he hated having to
say it. The Uncle said, ‘Pooh, pooh!’ to that, and then he said he
was afraid that what that same business wanted was not capital but
management. Then I heard my Father say, ‘It is not a pleasant subject:
I am sorry I introduced it. Suppose we change it, sir. Let me fill your
glass.’ Then the poor Indian said something about vintage--and that
a poor, broken-down man like he was couldn’t be too careful. And then
Father said, ‘Well, whisky then,’ and afterwards they talked about
Native Races and Imperial something or other and it got very dull.

So then Oswald remembered that you must not hear what people do not
intend you to hear--even if you are not listening and he said, ‘We ought
not to stay here any longer. Perhaps they would not like us to hear--’

Alice said, ‘Oh, do you think it could possibly matter?’ and went and
shut the study door softly but quite tight. So it was no use staying
there any longer, and we went to the nursery.

Then Noel said, ‘Now I understand. Of course my Father is making a
banquet for the Indian, because he is a poor, broken-down man. We might
have known that from “Lo, the poor Indian!” you know.’

We all agreed with him, and we were glad to have the thing explained,
because we had not understood before what Father wanted to have people
to dinner for--and not let us come in.

‘Poor people are very proud,’ said Alice, ‘and I expect Father thought
the Indian would be ashamed, if all of us children knew how poor he
was.’

Then Dora said, ‘Poverty is no disgrace. We should honour honest
Poverty.’

And we all agreed that that was so.

‘I wish his dinner had not been so nasty,’ Dora said, while Oswald put
lumps of coal on the fire with his fingers, so as not to make a noise.
He is a very thoughtful boy, and he did not wipe his fingers on his
trouser leg as perhaps Noel or H. O. would have done, but he just rubbed
them on Dora’s handkerchief while she was talking.

‘I am afraid the dinner was horrid.’ Dora went on. ‘The table looked
very nice with the flowers we got. I set it myself, and Eliza made me
borrow the silver spoons and forks from Albert-next-door’s Mother.’

‘I hope the poor Indian is honest,’ said Dicky gloomily, ‘when you are a
poor, broken-down man silver spoons must be a great temptation.’

Oswald told him not to talk such tommy-rot because the Indian was a
relation, so of course he couldn’t do anything dishonourable. And Dora
said it was all right any way, because she had washed up the spoons and
forks herself and counted them, and they were all there, and she had
put them into their wash-leather bag, and taken them back to
Albert-next-door’s Mother.

‘And the brussels sprouts were all wet and swimmy,’ she went on, ‘and
the potatoes looked grey--and there were bits of black in the gravy--and
the mutton was bluey-red and soft in the middle. I saw it when it came
out. The apple-pie looked very nice--but it wasn’t quite done in the
apply part. The other thing that was burnt--you must have smelt it, was
the soup.’

‘It is a pity,’ said Oswald; ‘I don’t suppose he gets a good dinner
every day.’

‘No more do we,’ said H. O., ‘but we shall to-morrow.’

I thought of all the things we had bought with our half-sovereign--the
rabbit and the sweets and the almonds and raisins and figs and the
coconut: and I thought of the nasty mutton and things, and while I was
thinking about it all Alice said--

‘Let’s ask the poor Indian to come to dinner with _us_ to-morrow.’ I
should have said it myself if she had given me time.

We got the little ones to go to bed by promising to put a note on their
dressing-table saying what had happened, so that they might know the
first thing in the morning, or in the middle of the night if they
happened to wake up, and then we elders arranged everything.

I waited by the back door, and when the Uncle was beginning to go Dicky
was to drop a marble down between the banisters for a signal, so that I
could run round and meet the Uncle as he came out.

This seems like deceit, but if you are a thoughtful and considerate boy
you will understand that we could not go down and say to the Uncle in
the hall under Father’s eye, ‘Father has given you a beastly, nasty
dinner, but if you will come to dinner with us tomorrow, we will show
you our idea of good things to eat.’ You will see, if you think it over,
that this would not have been at all polite to Father.

So when the Uncle left, Father saw him to the door and let him out, and
then went back to the study, looking very sad, Dora says.

As the poor Indian came down our steps he saw me there at the gate.

I did not mind his being poor, and I said, ‘Good evening, Uncle,’ just
as politely as though he had been about to ascend into one of the gilded
chariots of the rich and affluent, instead of having to walk to the
station a quarter of a mile in the mud, unless he had the money for a
tram fare.

‘Good evening, Uncle.’ I said it again, for he stood staring at me.
I don’t suppose he was used to politeness from boys--some boys are
anything but--especially to the Aged Poor.

So I said, ‘Good evening, Uncle,’ yet once again. Then he said--

‘Time you were in bed, young man. Eh!--what?’

Then I saw I must speak plainly with him, man to man. So I did. I said--

‘You’ve been dining with my Father, and we couldn’t help hearing you
say the dinner was shocking. So we thought as you’re an Indian, perhaps
you’re very poor’--I didn’t like to tell him we had heard the dreadful
truth from his own lips, so I went on, ‘because of “Lo, the poor
Indian”--you know--and you can’t get a good dinner every day. And we are
very sorry if you’re poor; and won’t you come and have dinner with
us to-morrow--with us children, I mean? It’s a very, very good
dinner--rabbit, and hardbake, and coconut--and you needn’t mind us
knowing you’re poor, because we know honourable poverty is no disgrace,
and--’ I could have gone on much longer, but he interrupted me to
say--‘Upon my word! And what’s your name, eh?’

‘Oswald Bastable,’ I said; and I do hope you people who are reading this
story have not guessed before that I was Oswald all the time.

‘Oswald Bastable, eh? Bless my soul!’ said the poor Indian. ‘Yes, I’ll
dine with you, Mr Oswald Bastable, with all the pleasure in life. Very
kind and cordial invitation, I’m sure. Good night, sir. At one o’clock,
I presume?’

‘Yes, at one,’ I said. ‘Good night, sir.’

Then I went in and told the others, and we wrote a paper and put it on
the boy’s dressing-table, and it said--

‘The poor Indian is coming at one. He seemed very grateful to me for my
kindness.’

We did not tell Father that the Uncle was coming to dinner with us,
for the polite reason that I have explained before. But we had to tell
Eliza; so we said a friend was coming to dinner and we wanted everything
very nice. I think she thought it was Albert-next-door, but she was in
a good temper that day, and she agreed to cook the rabbit and to make a
pudding with currants in it. And when one o’clock came the Indian Uncle
came too. I let him in and helped him off with his greatcoat, which was
all furry inside, and took him straight to the nursery. We were to have
dinner there as usual, for we had decided from the first that he would
enjoy himself more if he was not made a stranger of. We agreed to treat
him as one of ourselves, because if we were too polite, he might think
it was our pride because he was poor.

He shook hands with us all and asked our ages, and what schools we went
to, and shook his head when we said we were having a holiday just now. I
felt rather uncomfortable--I always do when they talk about schools--and
I couldn’t think of anything to say to show him we meant to treat him
as one of ourselves. I did ask if he played cricket. He said he had not
played lately. And then no one said anything till dinner came in. We had
all washed our faces and hands and brushed our hair before he came in,
and we all looked very nice, especially Oswald, who had had his hair
cut that very morning. When Eliza had brought in the rabbit and gone
out again, we looked at each other in silent despair, like in books.
It seemed as if it were going to be just a dull dinner like the one the
poor Indian had had the night before; only, of course, the things to
eat would be nicer. Dicky kicked Oswald under the table to make him say
something--and he had his new boots on, too!--but Oswald did not kick
back; then the Uncle asked--

‘Do you carve, sir, or shall I?’

Suddenly Alice said--

‘Would you like grown-up dinner, Uncle, or play-dinner?’

He did not hesitate a moment, but said, ‘Play-dinner, by all means.
Eh!--what?’ and then we knew it was all right.

So we at once showed the Uncle how to be a dauntless hunter. The rabbit
was the deer we had slain in the green forest with our trusty yew bows,
and we toasted the joints of it, when the Uncle had carved it, on bits
of firewood sharpened to a point. The Uncle’s piece got a little burnt,
but he said it was delicious, and he said game was always nicer when you
had killed it yourself. When Eliza had taken away the rabbit bones and
brought in the pudding, we waited till she had gone out and shut the
door, and then we put the dish down on the floor and slew the pudding in
the dish in the good old-fashioned way. It was a wild boar at bay, and
very hard indeed to kill, even with forks. The Uncle was very fierce
indeed with the pudding, and jumped and howled when he speared it, but
when it came to his turn to be helped, he said, ‘No, thank you; think of
my liver. Eh!--what?’

But he had some almonds and raisins--when we had climbed to the top of
the chest of drawers to pluck them from the boughs of the great trees;
and he had a fig from the cargo that the rich merchants brought in their
ship--the long drawer was the ship--and the rest of us had the sweets
and the coconut. It was a very glorious and beautiful feast, and when it
was over we said we hoped it was better than the dinner last night. And
he said:

‘I never enjoyed a dinner more.’ He was too polite to say what he really
thought about Father’s dinner. And we saw that though he might be poor,
he was a true gentleman.

He smoked a cigar while we finished up what there was left to eat, and
told us about tiger shooting and about elephants. We asked him about
wigwams, and wampum, and mocassins, and beavers, but he did not seem
to know, or else he was shy about talking of the wonders of his native
land.

We liked him very much indeed, and when he was going at last, Alice
nudged me, and I said--‘There’s one and threepence farthing left out
of our half-sovereign. Will you take it, please, because we do like you
very much indeed, and we don’t want it, really; and we would rather you
had it.’ And I put the money into his hand.

‘I’ll take the threepenny-bit,’ he said, turning the money over and
looking at it, ‘but I couldn’t rob you of the rest. By the way, where
did you get the money for this most royal spread--half a sovereign you
said--eh, what?’

We told him all about the different ways we had looked for treasure, and
when we had been telling some time he sat down, to listen better and at
last we told him how Alice had played at divining-rod, and how it really
had found a half-sovereign.

Then he said he would like to see her do it again. But we explained that
the rod would only show gold and silver, and that we were quite sure
there was no more gold in the house, because we happened to have looked
very carefully.

‘Well, silver, then,’ said he; ‘let’s hide the plate-basket, and little
Alice shall make the divining-rod find it. Eh!--what?’

‘There isn’t any silver in the plate-basket now,’ Dora said. ‘Eliza
asked me to borrow the silver spoons and forks for your dinner last
night from Albert-next-door’s Mother. Father never notices, but she
thought it would be nicer for you. Our own silver went to have the dents
taken out; and I don’t think Father could afford to pay the man for
doing it, for the silver hasn’t come back.’

‘Bless my soul!’ said the Uncle again, looking at the hole in the big
chair that we burnt when we had Guy Fawkes’ Day indoors. ‘And how much
pocket-money do you get? Eh!--what?’

‘We don’t have any now,’ said Alice; ‘but indeed we don’t want the other
shilling. We’d much rather you had it, wouldn’t we?’

And the rest of us said, ‘Yes.’ The Uncle wouldn’t take it, but he asked
a lot of questions, and at last he went away. And when he went he said--

‘Well, youngsters, I’ve enjoyed myself very much. I shan’t forget your
kind hospitality. Perhaps the poor Indian may be in a position to ask
you all to dinner some day.’

Oswald said if he ever could we should like to come very much, but he
was not to trouble to get such a nice dinner as ours, because we could
do very well with cold mutton and rice pudding. We do not like these
things, but Oswald knows how to behave. Then the poor Indian went away.

We had not got any treasure by this party, but we had had a very good
time, and I am sure the Uncle enjoyed himself.

We were so sorry he was gone that we could none of us eat much tea;
but we did not mind, because we had pleased the poor Indian and enjoyed
ourselves too. Besides, as Dora said, ‘A contented mind is a continual
feast,’ so it did not matter about not wanting tea.

Only H. O. did not seem to think a continual feast was a contented mind,
and Eliza gave him a powder in what was left of the red-currant jelly
Father had for the nasty dinner.

But the rest of us were quite well, and I think it must have been the
coconut with H. O. We hoped nothing had disagreed with the Uncle, but we
never knew.



CHAPTER 16. THE END OF THE TREASURE-SEEKING

Now it is coming near the end of our treasure-seeking, and the end was
so wonderful that now nothing is like it used to be. It is like as
if our fortunes had been in an earthquake, and after those, you know,
everything comes out wrong-way up.

The day after the Uncle speared the pudding with us opened in gloom and
sadness. But you never know. It was destined to be a day when things
happened. Yet no sign of this appeared in the early morning. Then all
was misery and upsetness. None of us felt quite well; I don’t know why:
and Father had one of his awful colds, so Dora persuaded him not to go
to London, but to stay cosy and warm in the study, and she made him some
gruel. She makes it better than Eliza does; Eliza’s gruel is all little
lumps, and when you suck them it is dry oatmeal inside.

We kept as quiet as we could, and I made H. O. do some lessons, like the
G. B. had advised us to. But it was very dull. There are some days
when you seem to have got to the end of all the things that could ever
possibly happen to you, and you feel you will spend all the rest of your
life doing dull things just the same way. Days like this are generally
wet days. But, as I said, you never know.

Then Dicky said if things went on like this he should run away to sea,
and Alice said she thought it would be rather nice to go into a convent.
H. O. was a little disagreeable because of the powder Eliza had given
him, so he tried to read two books at once, one with each eye, just
because Noel wanted one of the books, which was very selfish of him, so
it only made his headache worse. H. O. is getting old enough to learn by
experience that it is wrong to be selfish, and when he complained about
his head Oswald told him whose fault it was, because I am older than
he is, and it is my duty to show him where he is wrong. But he began to
cry, and then Oswald had to cheer him up because of Father wanting to be
quiet. So Oswald said--

‘They’ll eat H. O. if you don’t look out!’ And Dora said Oswald was too
bad.

Of course Oswald was not going to interfere again, so he went to look
out of the window and see the trams go by, and by and by H. O. came and
looked out too, and Oswald, who knows when to be generous and forgiving,
gave him a piece of blue pencil and two nibs, as good as new, to keep.

As they were looking out at the rain splashing on the stones in the
street they saw a four-wheeled cab come lumbering up from the way the
station is. Oswald called out--

‘Here comes the coach of the Fairy Godmother. It’ll stop here, you see
if it doesn’t!’

So they all came to the window to look. Oswald had only said that about
stopping and he was stricken with wonder and amaze when the cab really
did stop. It had boxes on the top and knobby parcels sticking out of
the window, and it was something like going away to the seaside and
something like the gentleman who takes things about in a carriage with
the wooden shutters up, to sell to the drapers’ shops. The cabman got
down, and some one inside handed out ever so many parcels of different
shapes and sizes, and the cabman stood holding them in his arms and
grinning over them.

Dora said, ‘It is a pity some one doesn’t tell him this isn’t the
house.’ And then from inside the cab some one put out a foot feeling for
the step, like a tortoise’s foot coming out from under his shell
when you are holding him off the ground, and then a leg came and more
parcels, and then Noel cried--

‘It’s the poor Indian!’

And it was.

Eliza opened the door, and we were all leaning over the banisters.
Father heard the noise of parcels and boxes in the hall, and he came out
without remembering how bad his cold was. If you do that yourself when
you have a cold they call you careless and naughty. Then we heard the
poor Indian say to Father--

‘I say, Dick, I dined with your kids yesterday--as I daresay they’ve
told you. Jolliest little cubs I ever saw! Why didn’t you let me see
them the other night? The eldest is the image of poor Janey--and as to
young Oswald, he’s a man! If he’s not a man, I’m a nigger! Eh!--what?
And Dick, I say, I shouldn’t wonder if I could find a friend to put a
bit into that business of yours--eh?’

Then he and Father went into the study and the door was shut--and we
went down and looked at the parcels. Some were done up in old, dirty
newspapers, and tied with bits of rag, and some were in brown paper and
string from the shops, and there were boxes. We wondered if the Uncle
had come to stay and this was his luggage, or whether it was to sell.
Some of it smelt of spices, like merchandise--and one bundle Alice felt
certain was a bale. We heard a hand on the knob of the study door after
a bit, and Alice said--

‘Fly!’ and we all got away but H. O., and the Uncle caught him by the
leg as he was trying to get upstairs after us.

‘Peeping at the baggage, eh?’ said the Uncle, and the rest of us came
down because it would have been dishonourable to leave H. O. alone in a
scrape, and we wanted to see what was in the parcels.

‘I didn’t touch,’ said H. O. ‘Are you coming to stay? I hope you are.’

‘No harm done if you did touch,’ said the good, kind, Indian man to all
of us. ‘For all these parcels are _for you_.’

I have several times told you about our being dumb with amazement and
terror and joy, and things like that, but I never remember us being
dumber than we were when he said this.

The Indian Uncle went on: ‘I told an old friend of mine what a
pleasant dinner I had with you, and about the threepenny-bit, and the
divining-rod, and all that, and he sent all these odds and ends as
presents for you. Some of the things came from India.’

‘Have you come from India, Uncle?’ Noel asked; and when he said ‘Yes’
we were all very much surprised, for we never thought of his being that
sort of Indian. We thought he was the Red kind, and of course his not
being accounted for his ignorance of beavers and things.

He got Eliza to help, and we took all the parcels into the nursery and
he undid them and undid them and undid them, till the papers lay thick
on the floor. Father came too and sat in the Guy Fawkes chair. I cannot
begin to tell you all the things that kind friend of Uncle’s had sent
us. He must be a very agreeable person.

There were toys for the kids and model engines for Dick and me, and a
lot of books, and Japanese china tea-sets for the girls, red and white
and gold--there were sweets by the pound and by the box--and long yards
and yards of soft silk from India, to make frocks for the girls--and a
real Indian sword for Oswald and a book of Japanese pictures for Noel,
and some ivory chess men for Dicky: the castles of the chessmen are
elephant-and-castles. There is a railway station called that; I never
knew what it meant before. The brown paper and string parcels had boxes
of games in them--and big cases of preserved fruits and things. And the
shabby old newspaper parcels and the boxes had the Indian things in. I
never saw so many beautiful things before. There were carved fans
and silver bangles and strings of amber beads, and necklaces of uncut
gems--turquoises and garnets, the Uncle said they were--and shawls and
scarves of silk, and cabinets of brown and gold, and ivory boxes and
silver trays, and brass things. The Uncle kept saying, ‘This is for you,
young man,’ or ‘Little Alice will like this fan,’ or ‘Miss Dora would
look well in this green silk, I think. Eh!--what?’

And Father looked on as if it was a dream, till the Uncle suddenly gave
him an ivory paper-knife and a box of cigars, and said, ‘My old friend
sent you these, Dick; he’s an old friend of yours too, he says.’ And he
winked at my Father, for H. O. and I saw him. And my Father winked back,
though he has always told us not to.

That was a wonderful day. It was a treasure, and no mistake! I never saw
such heaps and heaps of presents, like things out of a fairy-tale--and
even Eliza had a shawl. Perhaps she deserved it, for she did cook the
rabbit and the pudding; and Oswald says it is not her fault if her nose
turns up and she does not brush her hair. I do not think Eliza likes
brushing things. It is the same with the carpets. But Oswald tries to
make allowances even for people who do not wash their ears.

The Indian Uncle came to see us often after that, and his friend always
sent us something. Once he tipped us a sovereign each--the Uncle brought
it; and once he sent us money to go to the Crystal Palace, and the Uncle
took us; and another time to a circus; and when Christmas was near the
Uncle said--

‘You remember when I dined with you, some time ago, you promised to dine
with me some day, if I could ever afford to give a dinner-party. Well,
I’m going to have one--a Christmas party. Not on Christmas Day, because
every one goes home then--but on the day after. Cold mutton and rice
pudding. You’ll come? Eh!--what?’

We said we should be delighted, if Father had no objection, because that
is the proper thing to say, and the poor Indian, I mean the Uncle, said,
‘No, your Father won’t object--he’s coming too, bless your soul!’

We all got Christmas presents for the Uncle. The girls made him a
handkerchief case and a comb bag, out of some of the pieces of silk he
had given them. I got him a knife with three blades; H. O. got a siren
whistle, a very strong one, and Dicky joined with me in the knife, and
Noel would give the Indian ivory box that Uncle’s friend had sent on the
wonderful Fairy Cab day. He said it was the very nicest thing he had,
and he was sure Uncle wouldn’t mind his not having bought it with his
own money.

I think Father’s business must have got better--perhaps Uncle’s friend
put money in it and that did it good, like feeding the starving. Anyway
we all had new suits, and the girls had the green silk from India made
into frocks, and on Boxing Day we went in two cabs--Father and the girls
in one, and us boys in the other.

We wondered very much where the Indian Uncle lived, because we had not
been told. And we thought when the cab began to go up the hill towards
the Heath that perhaps the Uncle lived in one of the poky little houses
up at the top of Greenwich. But the cab went right over the Heath and in
at some big gates, and through a shrubbery all white with frost like
a fairy forest, because it was Christmas time. And at last we stopped
before one of those jolly, big, ugly red houses with a lot of windows,
that are so comfortable inside, and on the steps was the Indian Uncle,
looking very big and grand, in a blue cloth coat and yellow sealskin
waistcoat, with a bunch of seals hanging from it.

‘I wonder whether he has taken a place as butler here?’ said Dicky.

‘A poor, broken-down man--’

Noel thought it was very likely, because he knew that in these big
houses there were always thousands of stately butlers.

The Uncle came down the steps and opened the cab door himself, which I
don’t think butlers would expect to have to do. And he took us in. It
was a lovely hall, with bear and tiger skins on the floor, and a big
clock with the faces of the sun and moon dodging out when it was day or
night, and Father Time with a scythe coming out at the hours, and the
name on it was ‘Flint. Ashford. 1776’; and there was a fox eating a
stuffed duck in a glass case, and horns of stags and other animals over
the doors.

‘We’ll just come into my study first,’ said the Uncle, ‘and wish each
other a Merry Christmas.’ So then we knew he wasn’t the butler, but it
must be his own house, for only the master of the house has a study.

His study was not much like Father’s. It had hardly any books, but
swords and guns and newspapers and a great many boots, and boxes half
unpacked, with more Indian things bulging out of them.

We gave him our presents and he was awfully pleased. Then he gave us his
Christmas presents. You must be tired of hearing about presents, but
I must remark that all the Uncle’s presents were watches; there was a
watch for each of us, with our names engraved inside, all silver except
H. O.’s, and that was a Waterbury, ‘To match his boots,’ the Uncle said.
I don’t know what he meant.

Then the Uncle looked at Father, and Father said, ‘You tell them, sir.’

So the Uncle coughed and stood up and made a speech. He said--

‘Ladies and gentlemen, we are met together to discuss an important
subject which has for some weeks engrossed the attention of the
honourable member opposite and myself.’

I said, ‘Hear, hear,’ and Alice whispered, ‘What happened to the
guinea-pig?’ Of course you know the answer to that.

The Uncle went on--

‘I am going to live in this house, and as it’s rather big for me, your
Father has agreed that he and you shall come and live with me. And so,
if you’re agreeable, we’re all going to live here together, and, please
God, it’ll be a happy home for us all. Eh!--what?’

He blew his nose and kissed us all round. As it was Christmas I did
not mind, though I am much too old for it on other dates. Then he said,
‘Thank you all very much for your presents; but I’ve got a present here
I value more than anything else I have.’

I thought it was not quite polite of him to say so, till I saw that
what he valued so much was a threepenny-bit on his watch-chain, and, of
course, I saw it must be the one we had given him.

He said, ‘You children gave me that when you thought I was the poor
Indian, and I’ll keep it as long as I live. And I’ve asked some friends
to help us to be jolly, for this is our house-warming. Eh!--what?’

Then he shook Father by the hand, and they blew their noses; and then
Father said, ‘Your Uncle has been most kind--most--’

But Uncle interrupted by saying, ‘Now, Dick, no nonsense!’ Then H. O.
said, ‘Then you’re not poor at all?’ as if he were very disappointed.
The Uncle replied, ‘I have enough for my simple wants, thank you, H.
O.; and your Father’s business will provide him with enough for yours.
Eh!--what?’

Then we all went down and looked at the fox thoroughly, and made the
Uncle take the glass off so that we could see it all round and then the
Uncle took us all over the house, which is the most comfortable one I
have ever been in. There is a beautiful portrait of Mother in Father’s
sitting-room. The Uncle must be very rich indeed. This ending is like
what happens in Dickens’s books; but I think it was much jollier to
happen like a book, and it shows what a nice man the Uncle is, the way
he did it all.

Think how flat it would have been if the Uncle had said, when we first
offered him the one and threepence farthing, ‘Oh, I don’t want your
dirty one and three-pence! I’m very rich indeed.’ Instead of which he
saved up the news of his wealth till Christmas, and then told us all
in one glorious burst. Besides, I can’t help it if it is like Dickens,
because it happens this way. Real life is often something like books.

Presently, when we had seen the house, we were taken into the
drawing-room, and there was Mrs Leslie, who gave us the shillings and
wished us good hunting, and Lord Tottenham, and Albert-next-door’s
Uncle--and Albert-next-door, and his Mother (I’m not very fond of her),
and best of all our own Robber and his two kids, and our Robber had a
new suit on. The Uncle told us he had asked the people who had been kind
to us, and Noel said, ‘Where is my noble editor that I wrote the poetry
to?’

The Uncle said he had not had the courage to ask a strange editor to
dinner; but Lord Tottenham was an old friend of Uncle’s, and he had
introduced Uncle to Mrs Leslie, and that was how he had the pride and
pleasure of welcoming her to our house-warming. And he made her a bow
like you see on a Christmas card.

Then Alice asked, ‘What about Mr Rosenbaum? He was kind; it would have
been a pleasant surprise for him.’

But everybody laughed, and Uncle said--

‘Your father has paid him the sovereign he lent you. I don’t think he
could have borne another pleasant surprise.’

And I said there was the butcher, and he was really kind; but they only
laughed, and Father said you could not ask all your business friends to
a private dinner.

Then it was dinner-time, and we thought of Uncle’s talk about cold
mutton and rice. But it was a beautiful dinner, and I never saw such a
dessert! We had ours on plates to take away into another sitting-room,
which was much jollier than sitting round the table with the grown-ups.
But the Robber’s kids stayed with their Father. They were very shy and
frightened, and said hardly anything, but looked all about with very
bright eyes. H. O. thought they were like white mice; but afterwards we
got to know them very well, and in the end they were not so mousy. And
there is a good deal of interesting stuff to tell about them; but I
shall put all that in another book, for there is no room for it in this
one. We played desert islands all the afternoon and drank Uncle’s health
in ginger wine. It was H. O. that upset his over Alice’s green silk
dress, and she never even rowed him. Brothers ought not to have
favourites, and Oswald would never be so mean as to have a favourite
sister, or, if he had, wild horses should not make him tell who it was.

And now we are to go on living in the big house on the Heath, and it is
very jolly.

Mrs Leslie often comes to see us, and our own Robber and
Albert-next-door’s uncle. The Indian Uncle likes him because he has been
in India too and is brown; but our Uncle does not like Albert-next-door.
He says he is a muff. And I am to go to Rugby, and so are Noel and H.
O., and perhaps to Balliol afterwards. Balliol is my Father’s college.
It has two separate coats of arms, which many other colleges are not
allowed. Noel is going to be a poet and Dicky wants to go into Father’s
business.

The Uncle is a real good old sort; and just think, we should never have
found him if we hadn’t made up our minds to be Treasure Seekers! Noel
made a poem about it--

    Lo! the poor Indian from lands afar,
    Comes where the treasure seekers are;
    We looked for treasure, but we find
    The best treasure of all is the Uncle good and kind.

I thought it was rather rot, but Alice would show it to the Uncle, and
he liked it very much. He kissed Alice and he smacked Noel on the back,
and he said, ‘I don’t think I’ve done so badly either, if you come
to that, though I was never a regular professional treasure seeker.
Eh!--what?’

CHAPTER 1. THE EGG


It began with the day when it was almost the Fifth of November, and a
doubt arose in some breast--Robert’s, I fancy--as to the quality of the
fireworks laid in for the Guy Fawkes celebration.

‘They were jolly cheap,’ said whoever it was, and I think it was Robert,
‘and suppose they didn’t go off on the night? Those Prosser kids would
have something to snigger about then.’

‘The ones _I_ got are all right,’ Jane said; ‘I know they are, because
the man at the shop said they were worth thribble the money--’

‘I’m sure thribble isn’t grammar,’ Anthea said.

‘Of course it isn’t,’ said Cyril; ‘one word can’t be grammar all by
itself, so you needn’t be so jolly clever.’

Anthea was rummaging in the corner-drawers of her mind for a very
disagreeable answer, when she remembered what a wet day it was, and how
the boys had been disappointed of that ride to London and back on the
top of the tram, which their mother had promised them as a reward for
not having once forgotten, for six whole days, to wipe their boots on
the mat when they came home from school.

So Anthea only said, ‘Don’t be so jolly clever yourself, Squirrel. And
the fireworks look all right, and you’ll have the eightpence that your
tram fares didn’t cost to-day, to buy something more with. You ought to
get a perfectly lovely Catharine wheel for eightpence.’

‘I daresay,’ said Cyril, coldly; ‘but it’s not YOUR eightpence anyhow--’

‘But look here,’ said Robert, ‘really now, about the fireworks. We don’t
want to be disgraced before those kids next door. They think because
they wear red plush on Sundays no one else is any good.’

‘I wouldn’t wear plush if it was ever so--unless it was black to be
beheaded in, if I was Mary Queen of Scots,’ said Anthea, with scorn.

Robert stuck steadily to his point. One great point about Robert is the
steadiness with which he can stick.

‘I think we ought to test them,’ he said.

‘You young duffer,’ said Cyril, ‘fireworks are like postage-stamps. You
can only use them once.’

‘What do you suppose it means by “Carter’s tested seeds” in the
advertisement?’

There was a blank silence. Then Cyril touched his forehead with his
finger and shook his head.

‘A little wrong here,’ he said. ‘I was always afraid of that with poor
Robert. All that cleverness, you know, and being top in algebra so
often--it’s bound to tell--’

‘Dry up,’ said Robert, fiercely. ‘Don’t you see? You can’t TEST seeds if
you do them ALL. You just take a few here and there, and if those
grow you can feel pretty sure the others will be--what do you call
it?--Father told me--“up to sample”. Don’t you think we ought to sample
the fire-works? Just shut our eyes and each draw one out, and then try
them.’

‘But it’s raining cats and dogs,’ said Jane.

‘And Queen Anne is dead,’ rejoined Robert. No one was in a very good
temper. ‘We needn’t go out to do them; we can just move back the table,
and let them off on the old tea-tray we play toboggans with. I don’t
know what YOU think, but _I_ think it’s time we did something, and
that would be really useful; because then we shouldn’t just HOPE the
fireworks would make those Prossers sit up--we should KNOW.’

‘It WOULD be something to do,’ Cyril owned with languid approval.

So the table was moved back. And then the hole in the carpet, that
had been near the window till the carpet was turned round, showed most
awfully. But Anthea stole out on tip-toe, and got the tray when cook
wasn’t looking, and brought it in and put it over the hole.

Then all the fireworks were put on the table, and each of the four
children shut its eyes very tight and put out its hand and grasped
something. Robert took a cracker, Cyril and Anthea had Roman candles;
but Jane’s fat paw closed on the gem of the whole collection, the
Jack-in-the-box that had cost two shillings, and one at least of the
party--I will not say which, because it was sorry afterwards--declared
that Jane had done it on purpose. Nobody was pleased. For the worst of
it was that these four children, with a very proper dislike of anything
even faintly bordering on the sneakish, had a law, unalterable as those
of the Medes and Persians, that one had to stand by the results of a
toss-up, or a drawing of lots, or any other appeal to chance, however
much one might happen to dislike the way things were turning out.

‘I didn’t mean to,’ said Jane, near tears. ‘I don’t care, I’ll draw
another--’

‘You know jolly well you can’t,’ said Cyril, bitterly. ‘It’s settled.
It’s Medium and Persian. You’ve done it, and you’ll have to stand by
it--and us too, worse luck. Never mind. YOU’LL have your pocket-money
before the Fifth. Anyway, we’ll have the Jack-in-the-box LAST, and get
the most out of it we can.’

So the cracker and the Roman candles were lighted, and they were
all that could be expected for the money; but when it came to the
Jack-in-the-box it simply sat in the tray and laughed at them, as Cyril
said. They tried to light it with paper and they tried to light it with
matches; they tried to light it with Vesuvian fusees from the pocket
of father’s second-best overcoat that was hanging in the hall. And then
Anthea slipped away to the cupboard under the stairs where the brooms
and dustpans were kept, and the rosiny fire-lighters that smell so nice
and like the woods where pine-trees grow, and the old newspapers and the
bees-wax and turpentine, and the horrid an stiff dark rags that are used
for cleaning brass and furniture, and the paraffin for the lamps. She
came back with a little pot that had once cost sevenpence-halfpenny when
it was full of red-currant jelly; but the jelly had been all eaten long
ago, and now Anthea had filled the jar with paraffin. She came in, and
she threw the paraffin over the tray just at the moment when Cyril was
trying with the twenty-third match to light the Jack-in-the-box. The
Jack-in-the-box did not catch fire any more than usual, but the paraffin
acted quite differently, and in an instant a hot flash of flame leapt
up and burnt off Cyril’s eyelashes, and scorched the faces of all
four before they could spring back. They backed, in four instantaneous
bounds, as far as they could, which was to the wall, and the pillar of
fire reached from floor to ceiling.

‘My hat,’ said Cyril, with emotion, ‘You’ve done it this time, Anthea.’

The flame was spreading out under the ceiling like the rose of fire in
Mr Rider Haggard’s exciting story about Allan Quatermain. Robert and
Cyril saw that no time was to be lost. They turned up the edges of the
carpet, and kicked them over the tray. This cut off the column of fire,
and it disappeared and there was nothing left but smoke and a dreadful
smell of lamps that have been turned too low.

All hands now rushed to the rescue, and the paraffin fire was only a
bundle of trampled carpet, when suddenly a sharp crack beneath their
feet made the amateur firemen start back. Another crack--the carpet
moved as if it had had a cat wrapped in it; the Jack-in-the-box had at
last allowed itself to be lighted, and it was going off with desperate
violence inside the carpet.

Robert, with the air of one doing the only possible thing, rushed to the
window and opened it. Anthea screamed, Jane burst into tears, and
Cyril turned the table wrong way up on top of the carpet heap. But the
firework went on, banging and bursting and spluttering even underneath
the table.

Next moment mother rushed in, attracted by the howls of Anthea, and in a
few moments the firework desisted and there was a dead silence, and
the children stood looking at each other’s black faces, and, out of the
corners of their eyes, at mother’s white one.

The fact that the nursery carpet was ruined occasioned but little
surprise, nor was any one really astonished that bed should prove the
immediate end of the adventure. It has been said that all roads lead to
Rome; this may be true, but at any rate, in early youth I am quite sure
that many roads lead to BED, and stop there--or YOU do.

The rest of the fireworks were confiscated, and mother was not pleased
when father let them off himself in the back garden, though he said,
‘Well, how else can you get rid of them, my dear?’

You see, father had forgotten that the children were in disgrace, and
that their bedroom windows looked out on to the back garden. So that
they all saw the fireworks most beautifully, and admired the skill with
which father handled them.

Next day all was forgotten and forgiven; only the nursery had to
be deeply cleaned (like spring-cleaning), and the ceiling had to be
whitewashed.

And mother went out; and just at tea-time next day a man came with a
rolled-up carpet, and father paid him, and mother said--

‘If the carpet isn’t in good condition, you know, I shall expect you to
change it.’ And the man replied--

‘There ain’t a thread gone in it nowhere, mum. It’s a bargain, if ever
there was one, and I’m more’n ‘arf sorry I let it go at the price; but
we can’t resist the lydies, can we, sir?’ and he winked at father and
went away.

Then the carpet was put down in the nursery, and sure enough there
wasn’t a hole in it anywhere.

As the last fold was unrolled something hard and loud-sounding bumped
out of it and trundled along the nursery floor. All the children
scrambled for it, and Cyril got it. He took it to the gas. It was shaped
like an egg, very yellow and shiny, half-transparent, and it had an odd
sort of light in it that changed as you held it in different ways. It
was as though it was an egg with a yolk of pale fire that just showed
through the stone.

‘I MAY keep it, mayn’t I, mother?’ Cyril asked.

And of course mother said no; they must take it back to the man who had
brought the carpet, because she had only paid for a carpet, and not for
a stone egg with a fiery yolk to it.

So she told them where the shop was, and it was in the Kentish Town
Road, not far from the hotel that is called the Bull and Gate. It was
a poky little shop, and the man was arranging furniture outside on the
pavement very cunningly, so that the more broken parts should show as
little as possible. And directly he saw the children he knew them again,
and he began at once, without giving them a chance to speak.

‘No you don’t’ he cried loudly; ‘I ain’t a-goin’ to take back no
carpets, so don’t you make no bloomin’ errer. A bargain’s a bargain, and
the carpet’s puffik throughout.’

‘We don’t want you to take it back,’ said Cyril; ‘but we found something
in it.’

‘It must have got into it up at your place, then,’ said the man, with
indignant promptness, ‘for there ain’t nothing in nothing as I sell.
It’s all as clean as a whistle.’

‘I never said it wasn’t CLEAN,’ said Cyril, ‘but--’

‘Oh, if it’s MOTHS,’ said the man, ‘that’s easy cured with borax. But I
expect it was only an odd one. I tell you the carpet’s good through and
through. It hadn’t got no moths when it left my ‘ands--not so much as an
hegg.’

‘But that’s just it,’ interrupted Jane; ‘there WAS so much as an egg.’

The man made a sort of rush at the children and stamped his foot.

‘Clear out, I say!’ he shouted, ‘or I’ll call for the police. A nice
thing for customers to ‘ear you a-coming ‘ere a-charging me with finding
things in goods what I sells. ‘Ere, be off, afore I sends you off with a
flea in your ears. Hi! constable--’

The children fled, and they think, and their father thinks, that they
couldn’t have done anything else. Mother has her own opinion.

But father said they might keep the egg.

‘The man certainly didn’t know the egg was there when he brought the
carpet,’ said he, ‘any more than your mother did, and we’ve as much
right to it as he had.’

So the egg was put on the mantelpiece, where it quite brightened up the
dingy nursery. The nursery was dingy, because it was a basement room,
and its windows looked out on a stone area with a rockery made of
clinkers facing the windows. Nothing grew in the rockery except London
pride and snails.

The room had been described in the house agent’s list as a ‘convenient
breakfast-room in basement,’ and in the daytime it was rather dark. This
did not matter so much in the evenings when the gas was alight, but then
it was in the evening that the blackbeetles got so sociable, and used to
come out of the low cupboards on each side of the fireplace where their
homes were, and try to make friends with the children. At least, I
suppose that was what they wanted, but the children never would.

On the Fifth of November father and mother went to the theatre, and
the children were not happy, because the Prossers next door had lots of
fireworks and they had none.

They were not even allowed to have a bonfire in the garden.

‘No more playing with fire, thank you,’ was father’s answer, when they
asked him.

When the baby had been put to bed the children sat sadly round the fire
in the nursery.

‘I’m beastly bored,’ said Robert.

‘Let’s talk about the Psammead,’ said Anthea, who generally tried to
give the conversation a cheerful turn.

‘What’s the good of TALKING?’ said Cyril. ‘What I want is for something
to happen. It’s awfully stuffy for a chap not to be allowed out in the
evenings. There’s simply nothing to do when you’ve got through your
homers.’

Jane finished the last of her home-lessons and shut the book with a
bang.

‘We’ve got the pleasure of memory,’ said she. ‘Just think of last
holidays.’

Last holidays, indeed, offered something to think of--for they had
been spent in the country at a white house between a sand-pit and a
gravel-pit, and things had happened. The children had found a Psammead,
or sand-fairy, and it had let them have anything they wished for--just
exactly anything, with no bother about its not being really for their
good, or anything like that. And if you want to know what kind of things
they wished for, and how their wishes turned out you can read it all in
a book called Five Children and It (It was the Psammead). If you’ve not
read it, perhaps I ought to tell you that the fifth child was the baby
brother, who was called the Lamb, because the first thing he ever said
was ‘Baa!’ and that the other children were not particularly handsome,
nor were they extra clever, nor extraordinarily good. But they were not
bad sorts on the whole; in fact, they were rather like you.

‘I don’t want to think about the pleasures of memory,’ said Cyril; ‘I
want some more things to happen.’

‘We’re very much luckier than any one else, as it is,’ said Jane. ‘Why,
no one else ever found a Psammead. We ought to be grateful.’

‘Why shouldn’t we GO ON being, though?’ Cyril asked--‘lucky, I mean, not
grateful. Why’s it all got to stop?’

‘Perhaps something will happen,’ said Anthea, comfortably. ‘Do you know,
sometimes I think we are the sort of people that things DO happen to.’

‘It’s like that in history,’ said Jane: ‘some kings are full of
interesting things, and others--nothing ever happens to them, except
their being born and crowned and buried, and sometimes not that.’

‘I think Panther’s right,’ said Cyril: ‘I think we are the sort of
people things do happen to. I have a sort of feeling things would happen
right enough if we could only give them a shove. It just wants something
to start it. That’s all.’

‘I wish they taught magic at school,’ Jane sighed. ‘I believe if we
could do a little magic it might make something happen.’

‘I wonder how you begin?’ Robert looked round the room, but he got no
ideas from the faded green curtains, or the drab Venetian blinds, or
the worn brown oil-cloth on the floor. Even the new carpet suggested
nothing, though its pattern was a very wonderful one, and always seemed
as though it were just going to make you think of something.

‘I could begin right enough,’ said Anthea; ‘I’ve read lots about it. But
I believe it’s wrong in the Bible.’

‘It’s only wrong in the Bible because people wanted to hurt other
people. I don’t see how things can be wrong unless they hurt somebody,
and we don’t want to hurt anybody; and what’s more, we jolly well
couldn’t if we tried. Let’s get the Ingoldsby Legends. There’s a thing
about Abra-cadabra there,’ said Cyril, yawning. ‘We may as well play at
magic. Let’s be Knights Templars. They were awfully gone on magic. They
used to work spells or something with a goat and a goose. Father says
so.’

‘Well, that’s all right,’ said Robert, unkindly; ‘you can play the goat
right enough, and Jane knows how to be a goose.’

‘I’ll get Ingoldsby,’ said Anthea, hastily. ‘You turn up the hearthrug.’

So they traced strange figures on the linoleum, where the hearthrug had
kept it clean. They traced them with chalk that Robert had nicked
from the top of the mathematical master’s desk at school. You know, of
course, that it is stealing to take a new stick of chalk, but it is not
wrong to take a broken piece, so long as you only take one. (I do not
know the reason of this rule, nor who made it.) And they chanted all the
gloomiest songs they could think of. And, of course, nothing happened.
So then Anthea said, ‘I’m sure a magic fire ought to be made of
sweet-smelling wood, and have magic gums and essences and things in it.’

‘I don’t know any sweet-smelling wood, except cedar,’ said Robert; ‘but
I’ve got some ends of cedar-wood lead pencil.’

So they burned the ends of lead pencil. And still nothing happened.

‘Let’s burn some of the eucalyptus oil we have for our colds,’ said
Anthea.

And they did. It certainly smelt very strong. And they burned lumps
of camphor out of the big chest. It was very bright, and made a horrid
black smoke, which looked very magical. But still nothing happened. Then
they got some clean tea-cloths from the dresser drawer in the kitchen,
and waved them over the magic chalk-tracings, and sang ‘The Hymn of the
Moravian Nuns at Bethlehem’, which is very impressive. And still nothing
happened. So they waved more and more wildly, and Robert’s tea-cloth
caught the golden egg and whisked it off the mantelpiece, and it fell
into the fender and rolled under the grate.

‘Oh, crikey!’ said more than one voice.

And every one instantly fell down flat on its front to look under the
grate, and there lay the egg, glowing in a nest of hot ashes.

‘It’s not smashed, anyhow,’ said Robert, and he put his hand under the
grate and picked up the egg. But the egg was much hotter than any one
would have believed it could possibly get in such a short time, and
Robert had to drop it with a cry of ‘Bother!’ It fell on the top bar of
the grate, and bounced right into the glowing red-hot heart of the fire.

‘The tongs!’ cried Anthea. But, alas, no one could remember where they
were. Every one had forgotten that the tongs had last been used to fish
up the doll’s teapot from the bottom of the water-butt, where the Lamb
had dropped it. So the nursery tongs were resting between the water-butt
and the dustbin, and cook refused to lend the kitchen ones.

‘Never mind,’ said Robert, ‘we’ll get it out with the poker and the
shovel.’

‘Oh, stop,’ cried Anthea. ‘Look at it! Look! look! look! I do believe
something IS going to happen!’

For the egg was now red-hot, and inside it something was moving. Next
moment there was a soft cracking sound; the egg burst in two, and out of
it came a flame-coloured bird. It rested a moment among the flames, and
as it rested there the four children could see it growing bigger and
bigger under their eyes.

Every mouth was a-gape, every eye a-goggle.

The bird rose in its nest of fire, stretched its wings, and flew out
into the room. It flew round and round, and round again, and where it
passed the air was warm. Then it perched on the fender. The children
looked at each other. Then Cyril put out a hand towards the bird. It put
its head on one side and looked up at him, as you may have seen a parrot
do when it is just going to speak, so that the children were hardly
astonished at all when it said, ‘Be careful; I am not nearly cool yet.’

They were not astonished, but they were very, very much interested.

They looked at the bird, and it was certainly worth looking at. Its
feathers were like gold. It was about as large as a bantam, only its
beak was not at all bantam-shaped. ‘I believe I know what it is,’ said
Robert. ‘I’ve seen a picture.’

He hurried away. A hasty dash and scramble among the papers on father’s
study table yielded, as the sum-books say, ‘the desired result’. But
when he came back into the room holding out a paper, and crying, ‘I say,
look here,’ the others all said ‘Hush!’ and he hushed obediently and
instantly, for the bird was speaking.

‘Which of you,’ it was saying, ‘put the egg into the fire?’

‘He did,’ said three voices, and three fingers pointed at Robert.

The bird bowed; at least it was more like that than anything else.

‘I am your grateful debtor,’ it said with a high-bred air.

The children were all choking with wonder and curiosity--all except
Robert. He held the paper in his hand, and he KNEW. He said so. He
said--

‘_I_ know who you are.’

And he opened and displayed a printed paper, at the head of which was a
little picture of a bird sitting in a nest of flames.

‘You are the Phoenix,’ said Robert; and the bird was quite pleased.

‘My fame has lived then for two thousand years,’ it said. ‘Allow me to
look at my portrait.’ It looked at the page which Robert, kneeling down,
spread out in the fender, and said--

‘It’s not a flattering likeness... And what are these characters?’ it
asked, pointing to the printed part.

‘Oh, that’s all dullish; it’s not much about YOU, you know,’ said Cyril,
with unconscious politeness; ‘but you’re in lots of books.’

‘With portraits?’ asked the Phoenix.

‘Well, no,’ said Cyril; ‘in fact, I don’t think I ever saw any portrait
of you but that one, but I can read you something about yourself, if you
like.’

The Phoenix nodded, and Cyril went off and fetched Volume X of the old
Encyclopedia, and on page 246 he found the following:--

‘Phoenix--in ornithology, a fabulous bird of antiquity.’

‘Antiquity is quite correct,’ said the Phoenix, ‘but fabulous--well, do
I look it?’

Every one shook its head. Cyril went on--


‘The ancients speak of this bird as single, or the only one of its
kind.’

‘That’s right enough,’ said the Phoenix.

‘They describe it as about the size of an eagle.’

‘Eagles are of different sizes,’ said the Phoenix; ‘it’s not at all a
good description.’

All the children were kneeling on the hearthrug, to be as near the
Phoenix as possible.

‘You’ll boil your brains,’ it said. ‘Look out, I’m nearly cool now;’ and
with a whirr of golden wings it fluttered from the fender to the table.
It was so nearly cool that there was only a very faint smell of burning
when it had settled itself on the table-cloth.

‘It’s only a very little scorched,’ said the Phoenix, apologetically;
‘it will come out in the wash. Please go on reading.’

The children gathered round the table.

‘The size of an eagle,’ Cyril went on, ‘its head finely crested with a
beautiful plumage, its neck covered with feathers of a gold colour, and
the rest of its body purple; only the tail white, and the eyes sparkling
like stars. They say that it lives about five hundred years in the
wilderness, and when advanced in age it builds itself a pile of sweet
wood and aromatic gums, fires it with the wafting of its wings, and thus
burns itself; and that from its ashes arises a worm, which in time grows
up to be a Phoenix. Hence the Phoenicians gave--’

‘Never mind what they gave,’ said the Phoenix, ruffling its golden
feathers. ‘They never gave much, anyway; they always were people who
gave nothing for nothing. That book ought to be destroyed. It’s
most inaccurate. The rest of my body was never purple, and as for
my--tail--well, I simply ask you, IS it white?’

It turned round and gravely presented its golden tail to the children.

‘No, it’s not,’ said everybody.

‘No, and it never was,’ said the Phoenix. ‘And that about the worm
is just a vulgar insult. The Phoenix has an egg, like all respectable
birds. It makes a pile--that part’s all right--and it lays its egg, and
it burns itself; and it goes to sleep and wakes up in its egg, and comes
out and goes on living again, and so on for ever and ever. I can’t tell
you how weary I got of it--such a restless existence; no repose.’

‘But how did your egg get HERE?’ asked Anthea.

‘Ah, that’s my life-secret,’ said the Phoenix. ‘I couldn’t tell it to
any one who wasn’t really sympathetic. I’ve always been a misunderstood
bird. You can tell that by what they say about the worm. I might tell
YOU,’ it went on, looking at Robert with eyes that were indeed starry.
‘You put me on the fire--’ Robert looked uncomfortable.

‘The rest of us made the fire of sweet-scented woods and gums, though,’
said Cyril.

‘And--and it was an accident my putting you on the fire,’ said Robert,
telling the truth with some difficulty, for he did not know how the
Phoenix might take it. It took it in the most unexpected manner.

‘Your candid avowal,’ it said, ‘removes my last scruple. I will tell you
my story.’

‘And you won’t vanish, or anything sudden will you? asked Anthea,
anxiously.

‘Why?’ it asked, puffing out the golden feathers, ‘do you wish me to
stay here?’

‘Oh YES,’ said every one, with unmistakable sincerity.

‘Why?’ asked the Phoenix again, looking modestly at the table-cloth.

‘Because,’ said every one at once, and then stopped short; only Jane
added after a pause, ‘you are the most beautiful person we’ve ever
seen.’ ‘You are a sensible child,’ said the Phoenix, ‘and I will NOT
vanish or anything sudden. And I will tell you my tale. I had resided,
as your book says, for many thousand years in the wilderness, which is
a large, quiet place with very little really good society, and I was
becoming weary of the monotony of my existence. But I acquired the habit
of laying my egg and burning myself every five hundred years--and you
know how difficult it is to break yourself of a habit.’

‘Yes,’ said Cyril; ‘Jane used to bite her nails.’

‘But I broke myself of it,’ urged Jane, rather hurt, ‘You know I did.’

‘Not till they put bitter aloes on them,’ said Cyril.

‘I doubt,’ said the bird, gravely, ‘whether even bitter aloes (the aloe,
by the way, has a bad habit of its own, which it might well cure before
seeking to cure others; I allude to its indolent practice of flowering
but once a century), I doubt whether even bitter aloes could have cured
ME. But I WAS cured. I awoke one morning from a feverish dream--it was
getting near the time for me to lay that tiresome fire and lay that
tedious egg upon it--and I saw two people, a man and a woman. They were
sitting on a carpet--and when I accosted them civilly they narrated to
me their life-story, which, as you have not yet heard it, I will now
proceed to relate. They were a prince and princess, and the story of
their parents was one which I am sure you will like to hear. In early
youth the mother of the princess happened to hear the story of a certain
enchanter, and in that story I am sure you will be interested. The
enchanter--’

‘Oh, please don’t,’ said Anthea. ‘I can’t understand all these
beginnings of stories, and you seem to be getting deeper and deeper in
them every minute. Do tell us your OWN story. That’s what we really want
to hear.’

‘Well,’ said the Phoenix, seeming on the whole rather flattered, ‘to
cut about seventy long stories short (though _I_ had to listen to them
all--but to be sure in the wilderness there is plenty of time), this
prince and princess were so fond of each other that they did not want
any one else, and the enchanter--don’t be alarmed, I won’t go into
his history--had given them a magic carpet (you’ve heard of a magic
carpet?), and they had just sat on it and told it to take them right
away from every one--and it had brought them to the wilderness. And as
they meant to stay there they had no further use for the carpet, so they
gave it to me. That was indeed the chance of a lifetime!’

‘I don’t see what you wanted with a carpet,’ said Jane, ‘when you’ve got
those lovely wings.’

‘They ARE nice wings, aren’t they?’ said the Phoenix, simpering and
spreading them out. ‘Well, I got the prince to lay out the carpet, and I
laid my egg on it; then I said to the carpet, “Now, my excellent carpet,
prove your worth. Take that egg somewhere where it can’t be hatched for
two thousand years, and where, when that time’s up, some one will light
a fire of sweet wood and aromatic gums, and put the egg in to hatch;”
 and you see it’s all come out exactly as I said. The words were no
sooner out of my beak than egg and carpet disappeared. The royal lovers
assisted to arrange my pile, and soothed my last moments. I burnt myself
up and knew no more till I awoke on yonder altar.’

It pointed its claw at the grate.

‘But the carpet,’ said Robert, ‘the magic carpet that takes you anywhere
you wish. What became of that?’

‘Oh, THAT?’ said the Phoenix, carelessly--‘I should say that that is the
carpet. I remember the pattern perfectly.’

It pointed as it spoke to the floor, where lay the carpet which mother
had bought in the Kentish Town Road for twenty-two shillings and
ninepence.

At that instant father’s latch-key was heard in the door.

‘OH,’ whispered Cyril, ‘now we shall catch it for not being in bed!’

‘Wish yourself there,’ said the Phoenix, in a hurried whisper, ‘and then
wish the carpet back in its place.’

No sooner said than done. It made one a little giddy, certainly, and a
little breathless; but when things seemed right way up again, there the
children were, in bed, and the lights were out.

They heard the soft voice of the Phoenix through the darkness.

‘I shall sleep on the cornice above your curtains,’ it said. ‘Please
don’t mention me to your kinsfolk.’

‘Not much good,’ said Robert, ‘they’d never believe us. I say,’ he
called through the half-open door to the girls; ‘talk about adventures
and things happening. We ought to be able to get some fun out of a magic
carpet AND a Phoenix.’

‘Rather,’ said the girls, in bed.

‘Children,’ said father, on the stairs, ‘go to sleep at once. What do
you mean by talking at this time of night?’

No answer was expected to this question, but under the bedclothes Cyril
murmured one.

‘Mean?’ he said. ‘Don’t know what we mean. I don’t know what anything
means.’

‘But we’ve got a magic carpet AND a Phoenix,’ said Robert.

‘You’ll get something else if father comes in and catches you,’ said
Cyril. ‘Shut up, I tell you.’

Robert shut up. But he knew as well as you do that the adventures of
that carpet and that Phoenix were only just beginning.

Father and mother had not the least idea of what had happened in their
absence. This is often the case, even when there are no magic carpets or
Phoenixes in the house.

The next morning--but I am sure you would rather wait till the next
chapter before you hear about THAT.



CHAPTER 2. THE TOPLESS TOWER


The children had seen the Phoenix-egg hatched in the flames in their own
nursery grate, and had heard from it how the carpet on their own nursery
floor was really the wishing carpet, which would take them anywhere they
chose. The carpet had transported them to bed just at the right
moment, and the Phoenix had gone to roost on the cornice supporting the
window-curtains of the boys’ room.

‘Excuse me,’ said a gentle voice, and a courteous beak opened, very
kindly and delicately, the right eye of Cyril. ‘I hear the slaves below
preparing food. Awaken! A word of explanation and arrangement... I do
wish you wouldn’t--’

The Phoenix stopped speaking and fluttered away crossly to the
cornice-pole; for Cyril had hit out, as boys do when they are awakened
suddenly, and the Phoenix was not used to boys, and his feelings, if not
his wings, were hurt.

‘Sorry,’ said Cyril, coming awake all in a minute. ‘Do come back! What
was it you were saying? Something about bacon and rations?’

The Phoenix fluttered back to the brass rail at the foot of the bed.

‘I say--you ARE real,’ said Cyril. ‘How ripping! And the carpet?’

‘The carpet is as real as it ever was,’ said the Phoenix, rather
contemptuously; ‘but, of course, a carpet’s only a carpet, whereas a
Phoenix is superlatively a Phoenix.’

‘Yes, indeed,’ said Cyril, ‘I see it is. Oh, what luck! Wake up, Bobs!
There’s jolly well something to wake up for today. And it’s Saturday,
too.’

‘I’ve been reflecting,’ said the Phoenix, ‘during the silent watches
of the night, and I could not avoid the conclusion that you were quite
insufficiently astonished at my appearance yesterday. The ancients were
always VERY surprised. Did you, by chance, EXPECT my egg to hatch?’

‘Not us,’ Cyril said.

‘And if we had,’ said Anthea, who had come in in her nightie when she
heard the silvery voice of the Phoenix, ‘we could never, never have
expected it to hatch anything so splendid as you.’

The bird smiled. Perhaps you’ve never seen a bird smile?

‘You see,’ said Anthea, wrapping herself in the boys’ counterpane, for
the morning was chill, ‘we’ve had things happen to us before;’ and she
told the story of the Psammead, or sand-fairy.

‘Ah yes,’ said the Phoenix; ‘Psammeads were rare, even in my time. I
remember I used to be called the Psammead of the Desert. I was always
having compliments paid me; I can’t think why.’

‘Can YOU give wishes, then?’ asked Jane, who had now come in too.

‘Oh, dear me, no,’ said the Phoenix, contemptuously, ‘at least--but I
hear footsteps approaching. I hasten to conceal myself.’ And it did.

I think I said that this day was Saturday. It was also cook’s birthday,
and mother had allowed her and Eliza to go to the Crystal Palace with a
party of friends, so Jane and Anthea of course had to help to make beds
and to wash up the breakfast cups, and little things like that. Robert
and Cyril intended to spend the morning in conversation with the
Phoenix, but the bird had its own ideas about this.

‘I must have an hour or two’s quiet,’ it said, ‘I really must. My nerves
will give way unless I can get a little rest. You must remember it’s two
thousand years since I had any conversation--I’m out of practice, and I
must take care of myself. I’ve often been told that mine is a valuable
life.’ So it nestled down inside an old hatbox of father’s, which had
been brought down from the box-room some days before, when a helmet was
suddenly needed for a game of tournaments, with its golden head under
its golden wing, and went to sleep. So then Robert and Cyril moved
the table back and were going to sit on the carpet and wish themselves
somewhere else. But before they could decide on the place, Cyril said--

‘I don’t know. Perhaps it’s rather sneakish to begin without the girls.’

‘They’ll be all the morning,’ said Robert, impatiently. And then a thing
inside him, which tiresome books sometimes call the ‘inward monitor’,
said, ‘Why don’t you help them, then?’

Cyril’s ‘inward monitor’ happened to say the same thing at the same
moment, so the boys went and helped to wash up the tea-cups, and to dust
the drawing-room. Robert was so interested that he proposed to clean
the front doorsteps--a thing he had never been allowed to do. Nor was
he allowed to do it on this occasion. One reason was that it had already
been done by cook.

When all the housework was finished, the girls dressed the happy,
wriggling baby in his blue highwayman coat and three-cornered hat, and
kept him amused while mother changed her dress and got ready to take
him over to granny’s. Mother always went to granny’s every Saturday,
and generally some of the children went with her; but today they were to
keep house. And their hearts were full of joyous and delightful feelings
every time they remembered that the house they would have to keep had a
Phoenix in it, AND a wishing carpet.

You can always keep the Lamb good and happy for quite a long time if you
play the Noah’s Ark game with him. It is quite simple. He just sits on
your lap and tells you what animal he is, and then you say the little
poetry piece about whatever animal he chooses to be.

Of course, some of the animals, like the zebra and the tiger, haven’t
got any poetry, because they are so difficult to rhyme to. The Lamb
knows quite well which are the poetry animals.

‘I’m a baby bear!’ said the Lamb, snugging down; and Anthea began:


     ‘I love my little baby bear,
     I love his nose and toes and hair;
     I like to hold him in my arm,
     And keep him VERY safe and warm.’


And when she said ‘very’, of course there was a real bear’s hug.

Then came the eel, and the Lamb was tickled till he wriggled exactly
like a real one:


     ‘I love my little baby eel,
     He is so squidglety to feel;
     He’ll be an eel when he is big--
     But now he’s just--a--tiny SNIG!’


Perhaps you didn’t know that a snig was a baby eel? It is, though, and
the Lamb knew it.

‘Hedgehog now-!’ he said; and Anthea went on:


     ‘My baby hedgehog, how I like ye,
     Though your back’s so prickly-spiky;
     Your front is very soft, I’ve found,
     So I must love you front ways round!’


And then she loved him front ways round, while he squealed with
pleasure.

It is a very baby game, and, of course, the rhymes are only meant for
very, very small people--not for people who are old enough to read
books, so I won’t tell you any more of them.

By the time the Lamb had been a baby lion and a baby weazel, and a baby
rabbit and a baby rat, mother was ready; and she and the Lamb, having
been kissed by everybody and hugged as thoroughly as it is possible to
be when you’re dressed for out-of-doors, were seen to the tram by the
boys. When the boys came back, every one looked at every one else and
said--

‘Now!’

They locked the front door and they locked the back door, and they
fastened all the windows. They moved the table and chairs off the
carpet, and Anthea swept it.

‘We must show it a LITTLE attention,’ she said kindly. ‘We’ll give it
tea-leaves next time. Carpets like tea-leaves.’

Then every one put on its out-door things, because as Cyril said, they
didn’t know where they might be going, and it makes people stare if you
go out of doors in November in pinafores and without hats.

Then Robert gently awoke the Phoenix, who yawned and stretched itself,
and allowed Robert to lift it on to the middle of the carpet, where it
instantly went to sleep again with its crested head tucked under its
golden wing as before. Then every one sat down on the carpet.

‘Where shall we go?’ was of course the question, and it was warmly
discussed. Anthea wanted to go to Japan. Robert and Cyril voted for
America, and Jane wished to go to the seaside.

‘Because there are donkeys there,’ said she.

‘Not in November, silly,’ said Cyril; and the discussion got warmer and
warmer, and still nothing was settled.

‘I vote we let the Phoenix decide,’ said Robert, at last. So they
stroked it till it woke. ‘We want to go somewhere abroad,’ they said,
‘and we can’t make up our minds where.’

‘Let the carpet make up ITS mind, if it has one,’ said the Phoenix.

‘Just say you wish to go abroad.’

So they did; and the next moment the world seemed to spin upside down,
and when it was right way up again and they were ungiddy enough to look
about them, they were out of doors.

Out of doors--this is a feeble way to express where they were. They
were out of--out of the earth, or off it. In fact, they were floating
steadily, safely, splendidly, in the crisp clear air, with the pale
bright blue of the sky above them, and far down below the pale bright
sun-diamonded waves of the sea. The carpet had stiffened itself somehow,
so that it was square and firm like a raft, and it steered itself so
beautifully and kept on its way so flat and fearless that no one was at
all afraid of tumbling off. In front of them lay land.

‘The coast of France,’ said the Phoenix, waking up and pointing with
its wing. ‘Where do you wish to go? I should always keep one wish, of
course--for emergencies--otherwise you may get into an emergency from
which you can’t emerge at all.’

But the children were far too deeply interested to listen.

‘I tell you what,’ said Cyril: ‘let’s let the thing go on and on, and
when we see a place we really want to stop at--why, we’ll just stop.
Isn’t this ripping?’

‘It’s like trains,’ said Anthea, as they swept over the low-lying
coast-line and held a steady course above orderly fields and straight
roads bordered with poplar trees--‘like express trains, only in trains
you never can see anything because of grown-ups wanting the windows
shut; and then they breathe on them, and it’s like ground glass, and
nobody can see anything, and then they go to sleep.’

‘It’s like tobogganing,’ said Robert, ‘so fast and smooth, only there’s
no door-mat to stop short on--it goes on and on.’

‘You darling Phoenix,’ said Jane, ‘it’s all your doing. Oh, look at
that ducky little church and the women with flappy cappy things on their
heads.’

‘Don’t mention it,’ said the Phoenix, with sleepy politeness.

‘OH!’ said Cyril, summing up all the rapture that was in every heart.
‘Look at it all--look at it--and think of the Kentish Town Road!’

Every one looked and every one thought. And the glorious, gliding,
smooth, steady rush went on, and they looked down on strange and
beautiful things, and held their breath and let it go in deep sighs, and
said ‘Oh!’ and ‘Ah!’ till it was long past dinner-time.

It was Jane who suddenly said, ‘I wish we’d brought that jam tart and
cold mutton with us. It would have been jolly to have a picnic in the
air.’

The jam tart and cold mutton were, however, far away, sitting quietly in
the larder of the house in Camden Town which the children were supposed
to be keeping. A mouse was at that moment tasting the outside of the
raspberry jam part of the tart (she had nibbled a sort of gulf, or bay,
through the pastry edge) to see whether it was the sort of dinner she
could ask her little mouse-husband to sit down to. She had had a very
good dinner herself. It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good.

‘We’ll stop as soon as we see a nice place,’ said Anthea. ‘I’ve got
threepence, and you boys have the fourpence each that your trams didn’t
cost the other day, so we can buy things to eat. I expect the Phoenix
can speak French.’

The carpet was sailing along over rocks and rivers and trees and towns
and farms and fields. It reminded everybody of a certain time when all
of them had had wings, and had flown up to the top of a church tower,
and had had a feast there of chicken and tongue and new bread and
soda-water. And this again reminded them how hungry they were. And just
as they were all being reminded of this very strongly indeed, they saw
ahead of them some ruined walls on a hill, and strong and upright, and
really, to look at, as good as new--a great square tower.

‘The top of that’s just the exactly same size as the carpet,’ said Jane.
‘_I_ think it would be good to go to the top of that, because then none
of the Abby-what’s-its-names--I mean natives--would be able to take the
carpet away even if they wanted to. And some of us could go out and get
things to eat--buy them honestly, I mean, not take them out of larder
windows.’

‘I think it would be better if we went--’ Anthea was beginning; but Jane
suddenly clenched her hands.

‘I don’t see why I should never do anything I want, just because I’m
the youngest. I wish the carpet would fit itself in at the top of that
tower--so there!’

The carpet made a disconcerting bound, and next moment it was hovering
above the square top of the tower. Then slowly and carefully it began to
sink under them. It was like a lift going down with you at the Army and
Navy Stores.

‘I don’t think we ought to wish things without all agreeing to them
first,’ said Robert, huffishly. ‘Hullo! What on earth?’

For unexpectedly and greyly something was coming up all round the four
sides of the carpet. It was as if a wall were being built by magic
quickness. It was a foot high--it was two feet high--three, four, five.
It was shutting out the light--more and more.

Anthea looked up at the sky and the walls that now rose six feet above
them.

‘We’re dropping into the tower,’ she screamed. ‘THERE WASN’T ANY TOP TO
IT. So the carpet’s going to fit itself in at the bottom.’

Robert sprang to his feet.

‘We ought to have--Hullo! an owl’s nest.’ He put his knee on a jutting
smooth piece of grey stone, and reached his hand into a deep window
slit--broad to the inside of the tower, and narrowing like a funnel to
the outside.

‘Look sharp!’ cried every one, but Robert did not look sharp enough. By
the time he had drawn his hand out of the owl’s nest--there were no eggs
there--the carpet had sunk eight feet below him.

‘Jump, you silly cuckoo!’ cried Cyril, with brotherly anxiety.

But Robert couldn’t turn round all in a minute into a jumping position.
He wriggled and twisted and got on to the broad ledge, and by the time
he was ready to jump the walls of the tower had risen up thirty feet
above the others, who were still sinking with the carpet, and Robert
found himself in the embrasure of a window; alone, for even the owls
were not at home that day. The wall was smoothish; there was no climbing
up, and as for climbing down--Robert hid his face in his hands, and
squirmed back and back from the giddy verge, until the back part of him
was wedged quite tight in the narrowest part of the window slit.

He was safe now, of course, but the outside part of his window was like
a frame to a picture of part of the other side of the tower. It was very
pretty, with moss growing between the stones and little shiny gems; but
between him and it there was the width of the tower, and nothing in it
but empty air. The situation was terrible. Robert saw in a flash that
the carpet was likely to bring them into just the same sort of tight
places that they used to get into with the wishes the Psammead granted
them.

And the others--imagine their feelings as the carpet sank slowly and
steadily to the very bottom of the tower, leaving Robert clinging to the
wall. Robert did not even try to imagine their feelings--he had quite
enough to do with his own; but you can.

As soon as the carpet came to a stop on the ground at the bottom of the
inside of the tower it suddenly lost that raft-like stiffness which had
been such a comfort during the journey from Camden Town to the topless
tower, and spread itself limply over the loose stones and little earthy
mounds at the bottom of the tower, just exactly like any ordinary
carpet. Also it shrank suddenly, so that it seemed to draw away from
under their feet, and they stepped quickly off the edges and stood on
the firm ground, while the carpet drew itself in till it was its proper
size, and no longer fitted exactly into the inside of the tower, but
left quite a big space all round it.

Then across the carpet they looked at each other, and then every chin
was tilted up and every eye sought vainly to see where poor Robert had
got to. Of course, they couldn’t see him.

‘I wish we hadn’t come,’ said Jane.

‘You always do,’ said Cyril, briefly. ‘Look here, we can’t leave Robert
up there. I wish the carpet would fetch him down.’

The carpet seemed to awake from a dream and pull itself together. It
stiffened itself briskly and floated up between the four walls of the
tower. The children below craned their heads back, and nearly broke
their necks in doing it. The carpet rose and rose. It hung poised darkly
above them for an anxious moment or two; then it dropped down again,
threw itself on the uneven floor of the tower, and as it did so it
tumbled Robert out on the uneven floor of the tower.

‘Oh, glory!’ said Robert, ‘that was a squeak. You don’t know how I felt.
I say, I’ve had about enough for a bit. Let’s wish ourselves at home
again and have a go at that jam tart and mutton. We can go out again
afterwards.’

‘Righto!’ said every one, for the adventure had shaken the nerves of
all. So they all got on to the carpet again, and said--

‘I wish we were at home.’

And lo and behold, they were no more at home than before. The carpet
never moved. The Phoenix had taken the opportunity to go to sleep.
Anthea woke it up gently.

‘Look here,’ she said.

‘I’m looking,’ said the Phoenix.

‘We WISHED to be at home, and we’re still here,’ complained Jane.

‘No,’ said the Phoenix, looking about it at the high dark walls of the
tower. ‘No; I quite see that.’

‘But we wished to be at home,’ said Cyril.

‘No doubt,’ said the bird, politely.

‘And the carpet hasn’t moved an inch,’ said Robert.

‘No,’ said the Phoenix, ‘I see it hasn’t.’

‘But I thought it was a wishing carpet?’

‘So it is,’ said the Phoenix.

‘Then why--?’ asked the children, altogether.

‘I did tell you, you know,’ said the Phoenix, ‘only you are so fond
of listening to the music of your own voices. It is, indeed, the most
lovely music to each of us, and therefore--’

‘You did tell us WHAT?’ interrupted an Exasperated.

‘Why, that the carpet only gives you three wishes a day and YOU’VE HAD
THEM.’

There was a heartfelt silence.

‘Then how are we going to get home?’ said Cyril, at last.

‘I haven’t any idea,’ replied the Phoenix, kindly. ‘Can I fly out and
get you any little thing?’

‘How could you carry the money to pay for it?’

‘It isn’t necessary. Birds always take what they want. It is not
regarded as stealing, except in the case of magpies.’

The children were glad to find they had been right in supposing this to
be the case, on the day when they had wings, and had enjoyed somebody
else’s ripe plums.

‘Yes; let the Phoenix get us something to eat, anyway,’ Robert urged--’
[‘If it will be so kind you mean,’ corrected Anthea, in a whisper); ‘if
it will be so kind, and we can be thinking while it’s gone.’

So the Phoenix fluttered up through the grey space of the tower and
vanished at the top, and it was not till it had quite gone that Jane
said--

‘Suppose it never comes back.’

It was not a pleasant thought, and though Anthea at once said, ‘Of
course it will come back; I’m certain it’s a bird of its word,’ a
further gloom was cast by the idea. For, curiously enough, there was
no door to the tower, and all the windows were far, far too high to be
reached by the most adventurous climber. It was cold, too, and Anthea
shivered.

‘Yes,’ said Cyril, ‘it’s like being at the bottom of a well.’

The children waited in a sad and hungry silence, and got little stiff
necks with holding their little heads back to look up the inside of the
tall grey tower, to see if the Phoenix were coming.

At last it came. It looked very big as it fluttered down between the
walls, and as it neared them the children saw that its bigness was
caused by a basket of boiled chestnuts which it carried in one claw.
In the other it held a piece of bread. And in its beak was a very large
pear. The pear was juicy, and as good as a very small drink. When the
meal was over every one felt better, and the question of how to get home
was discussed without any disagreeableness. But no one could think
of any way out of the difficulty, or even out of the tower; for the
Phoenix, though its beak and claws had fortunately been strong enough
to carry food for them, was plainly not equal to flying through the air
with four well-nourished children.

‘We must stay here, I suppose,’ said Robert at last, ‘and shout out
every now and then, and some one will hear us and bring ropes and
ladders, and rescue us like out of mines; and they’ll get up a
subscription to send us home, like castaways.’

‘Yes; but we shan’t be home before mother is, and then father’ll take
away the carpet and say it’s dangerous or something,’ said Cyril.

‘I DO wish we hadn’t come,’ said Jane.

And every one else said ‘Shut up,’ except Anthea, who suddenly awoke the
Phoenix and said--

‘Look here, I believe YOU can help us. Oh, I do wish you would!’

‘I will help you as far as lies in my power,’ said the Phoenix, at once.
‘What is it you want now?’

‘Why, we want to get home,’ said every one.

‘Oh,’ said the Phoenix. ‘Ah, hum! Yes. Home, you said? Meaning?’

‘Where we live--where we slept last night--where the altar is that your
egg was hatched on.’

‘Oh, there!’ said the Phoenix. ‘Well, I’ll do my best.’ It fluttered on
to the carpet and walked up and down for a few minutes in deep thought.
Then it drew itself up proudly.

‘I CAN help you,’ it said. ‘I am almost sure I can help you. Unless I
am grossly deceived I can help you. You won’t mind my leaving you for an
hour or two?’ and without waiting for a reply it soared up through the
dimness of the tower into the brightness above.

‘Now,’ said Cyril, firmly, ‘it said an hour or two. But I’ve read
about captives and people shut up in dungeons and catacombs and things
awaiting release, and I know each moment is an eternity. Those people
always do something to pass the desperate moments. It’s no use our
trying to tame spiders, because we shan’t have time.’

‘I HOPE not,’ said Jane, doubtfully.

‘But we ought to scratch our names on the stones or something.’

‘I say, talking of stones,’ said Robert, ‘you see that heap of stones
against the wall over in that corner. Well, I’m certain there’s a hole
in the wall there--and I believe it’s a door. Yes, look here--the stones
are round like an arch in the wall; and here’s the hole--it’s all black
inside.’

He had walked over to the heap as he spoke and climbed up to
it--dislodged the top stone of the heap and uncovered a little dark
space.

Next moment every one was helping to pull down the heap of stones, and
very soon every one threw off its jacket, for it was warm work.

‘It IS a door,’ said Cyril, wiping his face, ‘and not a bad thing
either, if--’

He was going to add ‘if anything happens to the Phoenix,’ but he didn’t
for fear of frightening Jane. He was not an unkind boy when he had
leisure to think of such things.

The arched hole in the wall grew larger and larger. It was very, very
black, even compared with the sort of twilight at the bottom of the
tower; it grew larger because the children kept pulling off the stones
and throwing them down into another heap. The stones must have been
there a very long time, for they were covered with moss, and some of
them were stuck together by it. So it was fairly hard work, as Robert
pointed out.

When the hole reached to about halfway between the top of the arch
and the tower, Robert and Cyril let themselves down cautiously on the
inside, and lit matches. How thankful they felt then that they had a
sensible father, who did not forbid them to carry matches, as some boys’
fathers do. The father of Robert and Cyril only insisted on the matches
being of the kind that strike only on the box.

‘It’s not a door, it’s a sort of tunnel,’ Robert cried to the girls,
after the first match had flared up, flickered, and gone out. ‘Stand
off--we’ll push some more stones down!’

They did, amid deep excitement. And now the stone heap was almost
gone--and before them the girls saw the dark archway leading to unknown
things. All doubts and fears as to getting home were forgotten in this
thrilling moment. It was like Monte Cristo--it was like--

‘I say,’ cried Anthea, suddenly, ‘come out! There’s always bad air in
places that have been shut up. It makes your torches go out, and then
you die. It’s called fire-damp, I believe. Come out, I tell you.’

The urgency of her tone actually brought the boys out--and then every
one took up its jacket and fanned the dark arch with it, so as to
make the air fresh inside. When Anthea thought the air inside ‘must be
freshened by now,’ Cyril led the way into the arch.

The girls followed, and Robert came last, because Jane refused to tail
the procession lest ‘something’ should come in after her, and catch at
her from behind. Cyril advanced cautiously, lighting match after match,
and peering before him.

‘It’s a vaulting roof,’ he said, ‘and it’s all stone--all right,
Panther, don’t keep pulling at my jacket! The air must be all right
because of the matches, silly, and there are--look out--there are steps
down.’

‘Oh, don’t let’s go any farther,’ said Jane, in an agony of reluctance
(a very painful thing, by the way, to be in). ‘I’m sure there are
snakes, or dens of lions, or something. Do let’s go back, and come some
other time, with candles, and bellows for the fire-damp.’

‘Let me get in front of you, then,’ said the stern voice of Robert, from
behind. ‘This is exactly the place for buried treasure, and I’m going
on, anyway; you can stay behind if you like.’

And then, of course, Jane consented to go on.

So, very slowly and carefully, the children went down the steps--there
were seventeen of them--and at the bottom of the steps were more
passages branching four ways, and a sort of low arch on the right-hand
side made Cyril wonder what it could be, for it was too low to be the
beginning of another passage.

So he knelt down and lit a match, and stooping very low he peeped in.

‘There’s SOMETHING,’ he said, and reached out his hand. It touched
something that felt more like a damp bag of marbles than anything else
that Cyril had ever touched.

‘I believe it IS a buried treasure,’ he cried.

And it was; for even as Anthea cried, ‘Oh, hurry up, Squirrel--fetch it
out!’ Cyril pulled out a rotting canvas bag--about as big as the paper
ones the greengrocer gives you with Barcelona nuts in for sixpence.

‘There’s more of it, a lot more,’ he said.

As he pulled the rotten bag gave way, and the gold coins ran and span
and jumped and bumped and chinked and clinked on the floor of the dark
passage.

I wonder what you would say if you suddenly came upon a buried treasure?
What Cyril said was, ‘Oh, bother--I’ve burnt my fingers!’ and as he
spoke he dropped the match. ‘AND IT WAS THE LAST!’ he added.

There was a moment of desperate silence. Then Jane began to cry.

‘Don’t,’ said Anthea, ‘don’t, Pussy--you’ll exhaust the air if you cry.
We can get out all right.’

‘Yes,’ said Jane, through her sobs, ‘and find the Phoenix has come back
and gone away again--because it thought we’d gone home some other way,
and--Oh, I WISH we hadn’t come.’

Every one stood quite still--only Anthea cuddled Jane up to her and
tried to wipe her eyes in the dark.

‘D-DON’T,’ said Jane; ‘that’s my EAR--I’m not crying with my ears.’

‘Come, let’s get on out,’ said Robert; but that was not so easy, for no
one could remember exactly which way they had come. It is very difficult
to remember things in the dark, unless you have matches with you, and
then of course it is quite different, even if you don’t strike one.

Every one had come to agree with Jane’s constant wish--and despair was
making the darkness blacker than ever, when quite suddenly the floor
seemed to tip up--and a strong sensation of being in a whirling lift
came upon every one. All eyes were closed--one’s eyes always are in the
dark, don’t you think? When the whirling feeling stopped, Cyril said
‘Earthquakes!’ and they all opened their eyes.

They were in their own dingy breakfast-room at home, and oh, how light
and bright and safe and pleasant and altogether delightful it seemed
after that dark underground tunnel! The carpet lay on the floor, looking
as calm as though it had never been for an excursion in its life. On
the mantelpiece stood the Phoenix, waiting with an air of modest yet
sterling worth for the thanks of the children.

‘But how DID you do it?’ they asked, when every one had thanked the
Phoenix again and again.

‘Oh, I just went and got a wish from your friend the Psammead.’

‘But how DID you know where to find it?’

‘I found that out from the carpet; these wishing creatures always know
all about each other--they’re so clannish; like the Scots, you know--all
related.’

‘But, the carpet can’t talk, can it?’

‘No.’

‘Then how--’

‘How did I get the Psammead’s address? I tell you I got it from the
carpet.’

‘DID it speak then?’

‘No,’ said the Phoenix, thoughtfully, ‘it didn’t speak, but I gathered
my information from something in its manner. I was always a singularly
observant bird.’

It was not till after the cold mutton and the jam tart, as well as the
tea and bread-and-butter, that any one found time to regret the golden
treasure which had been left scattered on the floor of the underground
passage, and which, indeed, no one had thought of till now, since the
moment when Cyril burnt his fingers at the flame of the last match.

‘What owls and goats we were!’ said Robert. ‘Look how we’ve always
wanted treasure--and now--’

‘Never mind,’ said Anthea, trying as usual to make the best of it.
‘We’ll go back again and get it all, and then we’ll give everybody
presents.’

More than a quarter of an hour passed most agreeably in arranging what
presents should be given to whom, and, when the claims of generosity had
been satisfied, the talk ran for fifty minutes on what they would buy
for themselves.

It was Cyril who broke in on Robert’s almost too technical account of
the motor-car on which he meant to go to and from school--

‘There!’ he said. ‘Dry up. It’s no good. We can’t ever go back. We don’t
know where it is.’

‘Don’t YOU know?’ Jane asked the Phoenix, wistfully.

‘Not in the least,’ the Phoenix replied, in a tone of amiable regret.

‘Then we’ve lost the treasure,’ said Cyril. And they had.

‘But we’ve got the carpet and the Phoenix,’ said Anthea.

‘Excuse me,’ said the bird, with an air of wounded dignity, ‘I do SO
HATE to seem to interfere, but surely you MUST mean the Phoenix and the
carpet?’



CHAPTER 3. THE QUEEN COOK


It was on a Saturday that the children made their first glorious journey
on the wishing carpet. Unless you are too young to read at all, you will
know that the next day must have been Sunday.

Sunday at 18, Camden Terrace, Camden Town, was always a very pretty
day. Father always brought home flowers on Saturday, so that the
breakfast-table was extra beautiful. In November, of course, the flowers
were chrysanthemums, yellow and coppery coloured. Then there were always
sausages on toast for breakfast, and these are rapture, after six days
of Kentish Town Road eggs at fourteen a shilling.

On this particular Sunday there were fowls for dinner, a kind of food
that is generally kept for birthdays and grand occasions, and there
was an angel pudding, when rice and milk and oranges and white icing do
their best to make you happy.

After dinner father was very sleepy indeed, because he had been working
hard all the week; but he did not yield to the voice that said, ‘Go and
have an hour’s rest.’ He nursed the Lamb, who had a horrid cough that
cook said was whooping-cough as sure as eggs, and he said--

‘Come along, kiddies; I’ve got a ripping book from the library, called
The Golden Age, and I’ll read it to you.’

Mother settled herself on the drawing-room sofa, and said she could
listen quite nicely with her eyes shut. The Lamb snugged into the
‘armchair corner’ of daddy’s arm, and the others got into a happy heap
on the hearth-rug. At first, of course, there were too many feet and
knees and shoulders and elbows, but real comfort was actually settling
down on them, and the Phoenix and the carpet were put away on the back
top shelf of their minds (beautiful things that could be taken out and
played with later), when a surly solid knock came at the drawing-room
door. It opened an angry inch, and the cook’s voice said, ‘Please, m’,
may I speak to you a moment?’

Mother looked at father with a desperate expression. Then she put her
pretty sparkly Sunday shoes down from the sofa, and stood up in them and
sighed.

‘As good fish in the sea,’ said father, cheerfully, and it was not till
much later that the children understood what he meant.

Mother went out into the passage, which is called ‘the hall’, where the
umbrella-stand is, and the picture of the ‘Monarch of the Glen’ in a
yellow shining frame, with brown spots on the Monarch from the damp
in the house before last, and there was cook, very red and damp in the
face, and with a clean apron tied on all crooked over the dirty one that
she had dished up those dear delightful chickens in. She stood there and
she seemed to get redder and damper, and she twisted the corner of her
apron round her fingers, and she said very shortly and fiercely--

‘If you please ma’am, I should wish to leave at my day month.’ Mother
leaned against the hatstand. The children could see her looking pale
through the crack of the door, because she had been very kind to the
cook, and had given her a holiday only the day before, and it seemed so
very unkind of the cook to want to go like this, and on a Sunday too.

‘Why, what’s the matter?’ mother said.

‘It’s them children,’ the cook replied, and somehow the children all
felt that they had known it from the first. They did not remember having
done anything extra wrong, but it is so frightfully easy to displease a
cook. ‘It’s them children: there’s that there new carpet in their room,
covered thick with mud, both sides, beastly yellow mud, and sakes alive
knows where they got it. And all that muck to clean up on a Sunday! It’s
not my place, and it’s not my intentions, so I don’t deceive you, ma’am,
and but for them limbs, which they is if ever there was, it’s not a bad
place, though I says it, and I wouldn’t wish to leave, but--’

‘I’m very sorry,’ said mother, gently. ‘I will speak to the children.
And you had better think it over, and if you REALLY wish to go, tell me
to-morrow.’

Next day mother had a quiet talk with cook, and cook said she didn’t
mind if she stayed on a bit, just to see.

But meantime the question of the muddy carpet had been gone into
thoroughly by father and mother. Jane’s candid explanation that the
mud had come from the bottom of a foreign tower where there was buried
treasure was received with such chilling disbelief that the others
limited their defence to an expression of sorrow, and of a determination
‘not to do it again’. But father said (and mother agreed with him,
because mothers have to agree with fathers, and not because it was her
own idea) that children who coated a carpet on both sides with thick
mud, and when they were asked for an explanation could only talk silly
nonsense--that meant Jane’s truthful statement--were not fit to have a
carpet at all, and, indeed, SHOULDN’T have one for a week!

So the carpet was brushed (with tea-leaves, too) which was the only
comfort Anthea could think of, and folded up and put away in the
cupboard at the top of the stairs, and daddy put the key in his trousers
pocket. ‘Till Saturday,’ said he.

‘Never mind,’ said Anthea, ‘we’ve got the Phoenix.’

But, as it happened, they hadn’t. The Phoenix was nowhere to be found,
and everything had suddenly settled down from the rosy wild beauty of
magic happenings to the common damp brownness of ordinary November life
in Camden Town--and there was the nursery floor all bare boards in
the middle and brown oilcloth round the outside, and the bareness and
yellowness of the middle floor showed up the blackbeetles with terrible
distinctness, when the poor things came out in the evening, as usual, to
try to make friends with the children. But the children never would.

The Sunday ended in gloom, which even junket for supper in the blue
Dresden bowl could hardly lighten at all. Next day the Lamb’s cough
was worse. It certainly seemed very whoopy, and the doctor came in his
brougham carriage.

Every one tried to bear up under the weight of the sorrow which it was
to know that the wishing carpet was locked up and the Phoenix mislaid. A
good deal of time was spent in looking for the Phoenix.

‘It’s a bird of its word,’ said Anthea. ‘I’m sure it’s not deserted us.
But you know it had a most awfully long fly from wherever it was to near
Rochester and back, and I expect the poor thing’s feeling tired out and
wants rest. I am sure we may trust it.’

The others tried to feel sure of this, too, but it was hard.

No one could be expected to feel very kindly towards the cook, since it
was entirely through her making such a fuss about a little foreign mud
that the carpet had been taken away.

‘She might have told us,’ said Jane, ‘and Panther and I would have
cleaned it with tea-leaves.’

‘She’s a cantankerous cat,’ said Robert.

‘I shan’t say what I think about her,’ said Anthea, primly, ‘because it
would be evil speaking, lying, and slandering.’

‘It’s not lying to say she’s a disagreeable pig, and a beastly
blue-nosed Bozwoz,’ said Cyril, who had read The Eyes of Light, and
intended to talk like Tony as soon as he could teach Robert to talk like
Paul.

And all the children, even Anthea, agreed that even if she wasn’t a
blue-nosed Bozwoz, they wished cook had never been born.

But I ask you to believe that they didn’t do all the things on purpose
which so annoyed the cook during the following week, though I daresay
the things would not have happened if the cook had been a favourite.
This is a mystery. Explain it if you can. The things that had happened
were as follows:

Sunday.--Discovery of foreign mud on both sides of the carpet.

Monday.--Liquorice put on to boil with aniseed balls in a saucepan.
Anthea did this, because she thought it would be good for the Lamb’s
cough. The whole thing forgotten, and bottom of saucepan burned out. It
was the little saucepan lined with white that was kept for the baby’s
milk.

Tuesday.--A dead mouse found in pantry. Fish-slice taken to dig grave
with. By regrettable accident fish-slice broken. Defence: ‘The cook
oughtn’t to keep dead mice in pantries.’

Wednesday.--Chopped suet left on kitchen table. Robert added chopped
soap, but he says he thought the suet was soap too.

Thursday.--Broke the kitchen window by falling against it during a
perfectly fair game of bandits in the area.

Friday.--Stopped up grating of kitchen sink with putty and filled sink
with water to make a lake to sail paper boats in. Went away and left the
tap running. Kitchen hearthrug and cook’s shoes ruined.

On Saturday the carpet was restored. There had been plenty of time
during the week to decide where it should be asked to go when they did
get it back.

Mother had gone over to granny’s, and had not taken the Lamb because he
had a bad cough, which, cook repeatedly said, was whooping-cough as sure
as eggs is eggs.

‘But we’ll take him out, a ducky darling,’ said Anthea. ‘We’ll take
him somewhere where you can’t have whooping-cough. Don’t be so silly,
Robert. If he DOES talk about it no one’ll take any notice. He’s always
talking about things he’s never seen.’

So they dressed the Lamb and themselves in out-of-doors clothes, and the
Lamb chuckled and coughed, and laughed and coughed again, poor dear, and
all the chairs and tables were moved off the carpet by the boys, while
Jane nursed the Lamb, and Anthea rushed through the house in one last
wild hunt for the missing Phoenix.

‘It’s no use waiting for it,’ she said, reappearing breathless in the
breakfast-room. ‘But I know it hasn’t deserted us. It’s a bird of its
word.’

‘Quite so,’ said the gentle voice of the Phoenix from beneath the table.

Every one fell on its knees and looked up, and there was the Phoenix
perched on a crossbar of wood that ran across under the table, and had
once supported a drawer, in the happy days before the drawer had been
used as a boat, and its bottom unfortunately trodden out by Raggett’s
Really Reliable School Boots on the feet of Robert.

‘I’ve been here all the time,’ said the Phoenix, yawning politely
behind its claw. ‘If you wanted me you should have recited the ode of
invocation; it’s seven thousand lines long, and written in very pure and
beautiful Greek.’

‘Couldn’t you tell it us in English?’ asked Anthea.

‘It’s rather long, isn’t it?’ said Jane, jumping the Lamb on her knee.

‘Couldn’t you make a short English version, like Tate and Brady?’

‘Oh, come along, do,’ said Robert, holding out his hand. ‘Come along,
good old Phoenix.’

‘Good old BEAUTIFUL Phoenix,’ it corrected shyly.

‘Good old BEAUTIFUL Phoenix, then. Come along, come along,’ said Robert,
impatiently, with his hand still held out.

The Phoenix fluttered at once on to his wrist.

‘This amiable youth,’ it said to the others, ‘has miraculously been able
to put the whole meaning of the seven thousand lines of Greek invocation
into one English hexameter--a little misplaced some of the words--but--

‘Oh, come along, come along, good old beautiful Phoenix!’

‘Not perfect, I admit--but not bad for a boy of his age.’

‘Well, now then,’ said Robert, stepping back on to the carpet with the
golden Phoenix on his wrist.

‘You look like the king’s falconer,’ said Jane, sitting down on the
carpet with the baby on her lap.

Robert tried to go on looking like it. Cyril and Anthea stood on the
carpet.

‘We shall have to get back before dinner,’ said Cyril, ‘or cook will
blow the gaff.’

‘She hasn’t sneaked since Sunday,’ said Anthea.

‘She--’ Robert was beginning, when the door burst open and the cook,
fierce and furious, came in like a whirlwind and stood on the corner of
the carpet, with a broken basin in one hand and a threat in the other,
which was clenched.

‘Look ‘ere!’ she cried, ‘my only basin; and what the powers am I to
make the beefsteak and kidney pudding in that your ma ordered for your
dinners? You don’t deserve no dinners, so yer don’t.’

‘I’m awfully sorry, cook,’ said Anthea gently; ‘it was my fault, and
I forgot to tell you about it. It got broken when we were telling our
fortunes with melted lead, you know, and I meant to tell you.’

‘Meant to tell me,’ replied the cook; she was red with anger, and really
I don’t wonder--‘meant to tell! Well, _I_ mean to tell, too. I’ve held
my tongue this week through, because the missus she said to me quiet
like, “We mustn’t expect old heads on young shoulders,” but now I shan’t
hold it no longer. There was the soap you put in our pudding, and me and
Eliza never so much as breathed it to your ma--though well we might--and
the saucepan, and the fish-slice, and--My gracious cats alive! what ‘ave
you got that blessed child dressed up in his outdoors for?’

‘We aren’t going to take him out,’ said Anthea; ‘at least--’ She stopped
short, for though they weren’t going to take him out in the Kentish
Town Road, they certainly intended to take him elsewhere. But not at all
where cook meant when she said ‘out’. This confused the truthful Anthea.

‘Out!’ said the cook, ‘that I’ll take care you don’t;’ and she snatched
the Lamb from the lap of Jane, while Anthea and Robert caught her by the
skirts and apron. ‘Look here,’ said Cyril, in stern desperation, ‘will
you go away, and make your pudding in a pie-dish, or a flower-pot, or a
hot-water can, or something?’

‘Not me,’ said the cook, briefly; ‘and leave this precious poppet for
you to give his deathercold to.’

‘I warn you,’ said Cyril, solemnly. ‘Beware, ere yet it be too late.’

‘Late yourself the little popsey-wopsey,’ said the cook, with angry
tenderness. ‘They shan’t take it out, no more they shan’t. And--Where
did you get that there yellow fowl?’ She pointed to the Phoenix.

Even Anthea saw that unless the cook lost her situation the loss would
be theirs.

‘I wish,’ she said suddenly, ‘we were on a sunny southern shore, where
there can’t be any whooping-cough.’

She said it through the frightened howls of the Lamb, and the sturdy
scoldings of the cook, and instantly the giddy-go-round-and-falling-lift
feeling swept over the whole party, and the cook sat down flat on the
carpet, holding the screaming Lamb tight to her stout print-covered
self, and calling on St Bridget to help her. She was an Irishwoman.

The moment the tipsy-topsy-turvy feeling stopped, the cook opened her
eyes, gave one sounding screech and shut them again, and Anthea took the
opportunity to get the desperately howling Lamb into her own arms.

‘It’s all right,’ she said; ‘own Panther’s got you. Look at the trees,
and the sand, and the shells, and the great big tortoises. Oh DEAR, how
hot it is!’

It certainly was; for the trusty carpet had laid itself out on a
southern shore that was sunny and no mistake, as Robert remarked. The
greenest of green slopes led up to glorious groves where palm-trees and
all the tropical flowers and fruits that you read of in Westward Ho! and
Fair Play were growing in rich profusion. Between the green, green slope
and the blue, blue sea lay a stretch of sand that looked like a carpet
of jewelled cloth of gold, for it was not greyish as our northern sand
is, but yellow and changing--opal-coloured like sunshine and rainbows.
And at the very moment when the wild, whirling, blinding, deafening,
tumbling upside-downness of the carpet-moving stopped, the children had
the happiness of seeing three large live turtles waddle down to the edge
of the sea and disappear in the water. And it was hotter than you can
possibly imagine, unless you think of ovens on a baking-day.

Every one without an instant’s hesitation tore off its
London-in-November outdoor clothes, and Anthea took off the Lamb’s
highwayman blue coat and his three-cornered hat, and then his jersey,
and then the Lamb himself suddenly slipped out of his little blue tight
breeches and stood up happy and hot in his little white shirt.

‘I’m sure it’s much warmer than the seaside in the summer,’ said Anthea.
‘Mother always lets us go barefoot then.’

So the Lamb’s shoes and socks and gaiters came off, and he stood digging
his happy naked pink toes into the golden smooth sand.

‘I’m a little white duck-dickie,’ said he--‘a little white duck-dickie
what swims,’ and splashed quacking into a sandy pool.

‘Let him,’ said Anthea; ‘it can’t hurt him. Oh, how hot it is!’

The cook suddenly opened her eyes and screamed, shut them, screamed
again, opened her eyes once more and said--

‘Why, drat my cats alive, what’s all this? It’s a dream, I expect.

Well, it’s the best I ever dreamed. I’ll look it up in the dream-book
to-morrow. Seaside and trees and a carpet to sit on. I never did!’

‘Look here,’ said Cyril, ‘it isn’t a dream; it’s real.’

‘Ho yes!’ said the cook; ‘they always says that in dreams.’

‘It’s REAL, I tell you,’ Robert said, stamping his foot. ‘I’m not going
to tell you how it’s done, because that’s our secret.’ He winked heavily
at each of the others in turn. ‘But you wouldn’t go away and make that
pudding, so we HAD to bring you, and I hope you like it.’

‘I do that, and no mistake,’ said the cook unexpectedly; ‘and it being a
dream it don’t matter what I say; and I WILL say, if it’s my last word,
that of all the aggravating little varmints--’ ‘Calm yourself, my good
woman,’ said the Phoenix.

‘Good woman, indeed,’ said the cook; ‘good woman yourself’ Then she
saw who it was that had spoken. ‘Well, if I ever,’ said she; ‘this is
something like a dream! Yellow fowls a-talking and all! I’ve heard of
such, but never did I think to see the day.’

‘Well, then,’ said Cyril, impatiently, ‘sit here and see the day now.
It’s a jolly fine day. Here, you others--a council!’ They walked along
the shore till they were out of earshot of the cook, who still sat
gazing about her with a happy, dreamy, vacant smile.

‘Look here,’ said Cyril, ‘we must roll the carpet up and hide it, so
that we can get at it at any moment. The Lamb can be getting rid of
his whooping-cough all the morning, and we can look about; and if the
savages on this island are cannibals, we’ll hook it, and take her back.
And if not, we’ll LEAVE HER HERE.’

‘Is that being kind to servants and animals, like the clergyman said?’
asked Jane.

‘Nor she isn’t kind,’ retorted Cyril.

‘Well--anyway,’ said Anthea, ‘the safest thing is to leave the carpet
there with her sitting on it. Perhaps it’ll be a lesson to her, and
anyway, if she thinks it’s a dream it won’t matter what she says when
she gets home.’

So the extra coats and hats and mufflers were piled on the carpet. Cyril
shouldered the well and happy Lamb, the Phoenix perched on Robert’s
wrist, and ‘the party of explorers prepared to enter the interior’.

The grassy slope was smooth, but under the trees there were tangled
creepers with bright, strange-shaped flowers, and it was not easy to
walk.

‘We ought to have an explorer’s axe,’ said Robert. ‘I shall ask father
to give me one for Christmas.’

There were curtains of creepers with scented blossoms hanging from the
trees, and brilliant birds darted about quite close to their faces.

‘Now, tell me honestly,’ said the Phoenix, ‘are there any birds here
handsomer than I am? Don’t be afraid of hurting my feelings--I’m a
modest bird, I hope.’

‘Not one of them,’ said Robert, with conviction, ‘is a patch upon you!’

‘I was never a vain bird,’ said the Phoenix, ‘but I own that you confirm
my own impression. I will take a flight.’ It circled in the air for a
moment, and, returning to Robert’s wrist, went on, ‘There is a path to
the left.’

And there was. So now the children went on through the wood more quickly
and comfortably, the girls picking flowers and the Lamb inviting
the ‘pretty dickies’ to observe that he himself was a ‘little white
real-water-wet duck!’

And all this time he hadn’t whooping-coughed once.

The path turned and twisted, and, always threading their way amid a
tangle of flowers, the children suddenly passed a corner and found
themselves in a forest clearing, where there were a lot of pointed
huts--the huts, as they knew at once, of SAVAGES.

The boldest heart beat more quickly. Suppose they WERE cannibals. It was
a long way back to the carpet.

‘Hadn’t we better go back?’ said Jane. ‘Go NOW,’ she said, and her voice
trembled a little. ‘Suppose they eat us.’

‘Nonsense, Pussy,’ said Cyril, firmly. ‘Look, there’s a goat tied up.
That shows they don’t eat PEOPLE.’

‘Let’s go on and say we’re missionaries,’ Robert suggested.

‘I shouldn’t advise THAT,’ said the Phoenix, very earnestly.

‘Why not?’

‘Well, for one thing, it isn’t true,’ replied the golden bird.

It was while they stood hesitating on the edge of the clearing that
a tall man suddenly came out of one of the huts. He had hardly any
clothes, and his body all over was a dark and beautiful coppery
colour--just like the chrysanthemums father had brought home on
Saturday. In his hand he held a spear. The whites of his eyes and the
white of his teeth were the only light things about him, except that
where the sun shone on his shiny brown body it looked white, too. If
you will look carefully at the next shiny savage you meet with next to
nothing on, you will see at once--if the sun happens to be shining at
the time--that I am right about this.

The savage looked at the children. Concealment was impossible. He
uttered a shout that was more like ‘Oo goggery bag-wag’ than anything
else the children had ever heard, and at once brown coppery people leapt
out of every hut, and swarmed like ants about the clearing. There was
no time for discussion, and no one wanted to discuss anything, anyhow.
Whether these coppery people were cannibals or not now seemed to matter
very little.

Without an instant’s hesitation the four children turned and ran back
along the forest path; the only pause was Anthea’s. She stood back to
let Cyril pass, because he was carrying the Lamb, who screamed with
delight. (He had not whooping-coughed a single once since the carpet
landed him on the island.)

‘Gee-up, Squirrel; gee-gee,’ he shouted, and Cyril did gee-up. The path
was a shorter cut to the beach than the creeper-covered way by which
they had come, and almost directly they saw through the trees the
shining blue-and-gold-and-opal of sand and sea.

‘Stick to it,’ cried Cyril, breathlessly.

They did stick to it; they tore down the sands--they could hear behind
them as they ran the patter of feet which they knew, too well, were
copper-coloured.

The sands were golden and opal-coloured--and BARE. There were wreaths of
tropic seaweed, there were rich tropic shells of the kind you would not
buy in the Kentish Town Road under at least fifteen pence a pair.
There were turtles basking lumpily on the water’s edge--but no cook, no
clothes, and no carpet.

‘On, on! Into the sea!’ gasped Cyril. ‘They MUST hate water.
I’ve--heard--savages always--dirty.’

Their feet were splashing in the warm shallows before his breathless
words were ended. The calm baby-waves were easy to go through. It is
warm work running for your life in the tropics, and the coolness of the
water was delicious. They were up to their arm-pits now, and Jane was up
to her chin.

‘Look!’ said the Phoenix. ‘What are they pointing at?’

The children turned; and there, a little to the west was a head--a head
they knew, with a crooked cap upon it. It was the head of the cook.

For some reason or other the savages had stopped at the water’s edge
and were all talking at the top of their voices, and all were pointing
copper-coloured fingers, stiff with interest and excitement, at the head
of the cook.

The children hurried towards her as quickly as the water would let them.

‘What on earth did you come out here for?’ Robert shouted; ‘and where on
earth’s the carpet?’

‘It’s not on earth, bless you,’ replied the cook, happily; ‘it’s UNDER
ME--in the water. I got a bit warm setting there in the sun, and I just
says, “I wish I was in a cold bath”--just like that--and next minute
here I was! It’s all part of the dream.’

Every one at once saw how extremely fortunate it was that the carpet had
had the sense to take the cook to the nearest and largest bath--the sea,
and how terrible it would have been if the carpet had taken itself and
her to the stuffy little bath-room of the house in Camden Town!

‘Excuse me,’ said the Phoenix’s soft voice, breaking in on the general
sigh of relief, ‘but I think these brown people want your cook.’

‘To--to eat?’ whispered Jane, as well as she could through the water
which the plunging Lamb was dashing in her face with happy fat hands and
feet.

‘Hardly,’ rejoined the bird. ‘Who wants cooks to EAT? Cooks are ENGAGED,
not eaten. They wish to engage her.’

‘How can you understand what they say?’ asked Cyril, doubtfully.

‘It’s as easy as kissing your claw,’ replied the bird. ‘I speak and
understand ALL languages, even that of your cook, which is difficult and
unpleasing. It’s quite easy, when you know how it’s done. It just comes
to you. I should advise you to beach the carpet and land the cargo--the
cook, I mean. You can take my word for it, the copper-coloured ones will
not harm you now.’

It is impossible not to take the word of a Phoenix when it tells you
to. So the children at once got hold of the corners of the carpet,
and, pulling it from under the cook, towed it slowly in through the
shallowing water, and at last spread it on the sand. The cook, who had
followed, instantly sat down on it, and at once the copper-coloured
natives, now strangely humble, formed a ring round the carpet, and fell
on their faces on the rainbow-and-gold sand. The tallest savage spoke
in this position, which must have been very awkward for him; and Jane
noticed that it took him quite a long time to get the sand out of his
mouth afterwards.

‘He says,’ the Phoenix remarked after some time, ‘that they wish to
engage your cook permanently.’

‘Without a character?’ asked Anthea, who had heard her mother speak of
such things.

‘They do not wish to engage her as cook, but as queen; and queens need
not have characters.’

There was a breathless pause.

‘WELL,’ said Cyril, ‘of all the choices! But there’s no accounting for
tastes.’

Every one laughed at the idea of the cook’s being engaged as queen; they
could not help it.

‘I do not advise laughter,’ warned the Phoenix, ruffling out his golden
feathers, which were extremely wet. ‘And it’s not their own choice. It
seems that there is an ancient prophecy of this copper-coloured tribe
that a great queen should some day arise out of the sea with a white
crown on her head, and--and--well, you see! There’s the crown!’

It pointed its claw at cook’s cap; and a very dirty cap it was, because
it was the end of the week.

‘That’s the white crown,’ it said; ‘at least, it’s nearly white--very
white indeed compared to the colour THEY are--and anyway, it’s quite
white enough.’

Cyril addressed the cook. ‘Look here!’ said he, ‘these brown people want
you to be their queen. They’re only savages, and they don’t know any
better. Now would you really like to stay? or, if you’ll promise not to
be so jolly aggravating at home, and not to tell any one a word about
to-day, we’ll take you back to Camden Town.’

‘No, you don’t,’ said the cook, in firm, undoubting tones. ‘I’ve always
wanted to be the Queen, God bless her! and I always thought what a good
one I should make; and now I’m going to. IF it’s only in a dream, it’s
well worth while. And I don’t go back to that nasty underground kitchen,
and me blamed for everything; that I don’t, not till the dream’s
finished and I wake up with that nasty bell a rang-tanging in my
ears--so I tell you.’

‘Are you SURE,’ Anthea anxiously asked the Phoenix, ‘that she will be
quite safe here?’

‘She will find the nest of a queen a very precious and soft thing,’ said
the bird, solemnly.

‘There--you hear,’ said Cyril. ‘You’re in for a precious soft thing,
so mind you’re a good queen, cook. It’s more than you’d any right to
expect, but long may you reign.’

Some of the cook’s copper-coloured subjects now advanced from the forest
with long garlands of beautiful flowers, white and sweet-scented, and
hung them respectfully round the neck of their new sovereign.

‘What! all them lovely bokays for me!’ exclaimed the enraptured cook.
‘Well, this here is something LIKE a dream, I must say.’

She sat up very straight on the carpet, and the copper-coloured ones,
themselves wreathed in garlands of the gayest flowers, madly stuck
parrot feathers in their hair and began to dance. It was a dance such as
you have never seen; it made the children feel almost sure that the
cook was right, and that they were all in a dream. Small, strange-shaped
drums were beaten, odd-sounding songs were sung, and the dance got
faster and faster and odder and odder, till at last all the dancers fell
on the sand tired out.

The new queen, with her white crown-cap all on one side, clapped wildly.

‘Brayvo!’ she cried, ‘brayvo! It’s better than the Albert Edward
Music-hall in the Kentish Town Road. Go it again!’

But the Phoenix would not translate this request into the
copper-coloured language; and when the savages had recovered their
breath, they implored their queen to leave her white escort and come
with them to their huts.

‘The finest shall be yours, O queen,’ said they.

‘Well--so long!’ said the cook, getting heavily on to her feet, when the
Phoenix had translated this request. ‘No more kitchens and attics for
me, thank you. I’m off to my royal palace, I am; and I only wish this
here dream would keep on for ever and ever.’

She picked up the ends of the garlands that trailed round her feet,
and the children had one last glimpse of her striped stockings and worn
elastic-side boots before she disappeared into the shadow of the forest,
surrounded by her dusky retainers, singing songs of rejoicing as they
went.

‘WELL!’ said Cyril, ‘I suppose she’s all right, but they don’t seem to
count us for much, one way or the other.’

‘Oh,’ said the Phoenix, ‘they think you’re merely dreams. The prophecy
said that the queen would arise from the waves with a white crown and
surrounded by white dream-children. That’s about what they think YOU
are!’

‘And what about dinner?’ said Robert, abruptly.

‘There won’t be any dinner, with no cook and no pudding-basin,’ Anthea
reminded him; ‘but there’s always bread-and-butter.’

‘Let’s get home,’ said Cyril.

The Lamb was furiously unwishful to be dressed in his warm clothes
again, but Anthea and Jane managed it, by force disguised as coaxing,
and he never once whooping-coughed.

Then every one put on its own warm things and took its place on the
carpet.

A sound of uncouth singing still came from beyond the trees where the
copper-coloured natives were crooning songs of admiration and respect
to their white-crowned queen. Then Anthea said ‘Home,’ just as duchesses
and other people do to their coachmen, and the intelligent carpet in
one whirling moment laid itself down in its proper place on the nursery
floor. And at that very moment Eliza opened the door and said--

‘Cook’s gone! I can’t find her anywhere, and there’s no dinner ready.
She hasn’t taken her box nor yet her outdoor things. She just ran out to
see the time, I shouldn’t wonder--the kitchen clock never did give her
satisfaction--and she’s got run over or fell down in a fit as likely
as not. You’ll have to put up with the cold bacon for your dinners; and
what on earth you’ve got your outdoor things on for I don’t know.
And then I’ll slip out and see if they know anything about her at the
police-station.’

But nobody ever knew anything about the cook any more, except the
children, and, later, one other person.


Mother was so upset at losing the cook, and so anxious about her, that
Anthea felt most miserable, as though she had done something very wrong
indeed. She woke several times in the night, and at last decided that
she would ask the Phoenix to let her tell her mother all about it. But
there was no opportunity to do this next day, because the Phoenix, as
usual, had gone to sleep in some out-of-the-way spot, after asking, as a
special favour, not to be disturbed for twenty-four hours.

The Lamb never whooping-coughed once all that Sunday, and mother and
father said what good medicine it was that the doctor had given him. But
the children knew that it was the southern shore where you can’t have
whooping-cough that had cured him. The Lamb babbled of coloured sand
and water, but no one took any notice of that. He often talked of things
that hadn’t happened.

It was on Monday morning, very early indeed, that Anthea woke and
suddenly made up her mind. She crept downstairs in her night-gown (it
was very chilly), sat down on the carpet, and with a beating heart
wished herself on the sunny shore where you can’t have whooping-cough,
and next moment there she was.

The sand was splendidly warm. She could feel it at once, even through
the carpet. She folded the carpet, and put it over her shoulders like
a shawl, for she was determined not to be parted from it for a single
instant, no matter how hot it might be to wear.

Then trembling a little, and trying to keep up her courage by saying
over and over, ‘It is my DUTY, it IS my duty,’ she went up the forest
path.

‘Well, here you are again,’ said the cook, directly she saw Anthea.

‘This dream does keep on!’

The cook was dressed in a white robe; she had no shoes and stockings
and no cap and she was sitting under a screen of palm-leaves, for it was
afternoon in the island, and blazing hot. She wore a flower wreath
on her hair, and copper-coloured boys were fanning her with peacock’s
feathers.

‘They’ve got the cap put away,’ she said. ‘They seem to think a lot of
it. Never saw one before, I expect.’

‘Are you happy?’ asked Anthea, panting; the sight of the cook as queen
quite took her breath away.

‘I believe you, my dear,’ said the cook, heartily. ‘Nothing to do unless
you want to. But I’m getting rested now. Tomorrow I’m going to start
cleaning out my hut, if the dream keeps on, and I shall teach them
cooking; they burns everything to a cinder now unless they eats it raw.’

‘But can you talk to them?’

‘Lor’ love a duck, yes!’ the happy cook-queen replied; ‘it’s quite easy
to pick up. I always thought I should be quick at foreign languages.
I’ve taught them to understand “dinner,” and “I want a drink,” and “You
leave me be,” already.’

‘Then you don’t want anything?’ Anthea asked earnestly and anxiously.

‘Not me, miss; except if you’d only go away. I’m afraid of me waking
up with that bell a-going if you keep on stopping here a-talking to me.
Long as this here dream keeps up I’m as happy as a queen.’

‘Goodbye, then,’ said Anthea, gaily, for her conscience was clear now.

She hurried into the wood, threw herself on the ground, and said
‘Home’--and there she was, rolled in the carpet on the nursery floor.

‘SHE’S all right, anyhow,’ said Anthea, and went back to bed. ‘I’m glad
somebody’s pleased. But mother will never believe me when I tell her.’

The story is indeed a little difficult to believe. Still, you might try.



CHAPTER 4. TWO BAZAARS


Mother was really a great dear. She was pretty and she was loving, and
most frightfully good when you were ill, and always kind, and almost
always just. That is, she was just when she understood things. But
of course she did not always understand things. No one understands
everything, and mothers are not angels, though a good many of them come
pretty near it. The children knew that mother always WANTED to do what
was best for them, even if she was not clever enough to know exactly
what was the best. That was why all of them, but much more particularly
Anthea, felt rather uncomfortable at keeping the great secret from her
of the wishing carpet and the Phoenix. And Anthea, whose inside mind was
made so that she was able to be much more uncomfortable than the others,
had decided that she MUST tell her mother the truth, however little
likely it was that her mother would believe it.

‘Then I shall have done what’s right,’ said she to the Phoenix; ‘and if
she doesn’t believe me it won’t be my fault--will it?’

‘Not in the least,’ said the golden bird. ‘And she won’t, so you’re
quite safe.’

Anthea chose a time when she was doing her home-lessons--they were
Algebra and Latin, German, English, and Euclid--and she asked her mother
whether she might come and do them in the drawing-room--‘so as to be
quiet,’ she said to her mother; and to herself she said, ‘And that’s not
the real reason. I hope I shan’t grow up a LIAR.’

Mother said, ‘Of course, dearie,’ and Anthea started swimming through
a sea of x’s and y’s and z’s. Mother was sitting at the mahogany bureau
writing letters.

‘Mother dear,’ said Anthea.

‘Yes, love-a-duck,’ said mother.

‘About cook,’ said Anthea. ‘_I_ know where she is.’

‘Do you, dear?’ said mother. ‘Well, I wouldn’t take her back after the
way she has behaved.’

‘It’s not her fault,’ said Anthea. ‘May I tell you about it from the
beginning?’

Mother laid down her pen, and her nice face had a resigned expression.
As you know, a resigned expression always makes you want not to tell
anybody anything.

‘It’s like this,’ said Anthea, in a hurry: ‘that egg, you know, that
came in the carpet; we put it in the fire and it hatched into the
Phoenix, and the carpet was a wishing carpet--and--’

‘A very nice game, darling,’ said mother, taking up her pen. ‘Now do
be quiet. I’ve got a lot of letters to write. I’m going to Bournemouth
to-morrow with the Lamb--and there’s that bazaar.’

Anthea went back to x y z, and mother’s pen scratched busily.

‘But, mother,’ said Anthea, when mother put down the pen to lick an
envelope, ‘the carpet takes us wherever we like--and--’

‘I wish it would take you where you could get a few nice Eastern things
for my bazaar,’ said mother. ‘I promised them, and I’ve no time to go to
Liberty’s now.’

‘It shall,’ said Anthea, ‘but, mother--’

‘Well, dear,’ said mother, a little impatiently, for she had taken up
her pen again.

‘The carpet took us to a place where you couldn’t have whooping-cough,
and the Lamb hasn’t whooped since, and we took cook because she was
so tiresome, and then she would stay and be queen of the savages. They
thought her cap was a crown, and--’

‘Darling one,’ said mother, ‘you know I love to hear the things you make
up--but I am most awfully busy.’

‘But it’s true,’ said Anthea, desperately.

‘You shouldn’t say that, my sweet,’ said mother, gently. And then Anthea
knew it was hopeless.

‘Are you going away for long?’ asked Anthea.

‘I’ve got a cold,’ said mother, ‘and daddy’s anxious about it, and the
Lamb’s cough.’

‘He hasn’t coughed since Saturday,’ the Lamb’s eldest sister
interrupted.

‘I wish I could think so,’ mother replied. ‘And daddy’s got to go to
Scotland. I do hope you’ll be good children.’

‘We will, we will,’ said Anthea, fervently. ‘When’s the bazaar?’

‘On Saturday,’ said mother, ‘at the schools. Oh, don’t talk any more,
there’s a treasure! My head’s going round, and I’ve forgotten how to
spell whooping-cough.’


Mother and the Lamb went away, and father went away, and there was a new
cook who looked so like a frightened rabbit that no one had the heart to
do anything to frighten her any more than seemed natural to her.

The Phoenix begged to be excused. It said it wanted a week’s rest, and
asked that it might not be disturbed. And it hid its golden gleaming
self, and nobody could find it.

So that when Wednesday afternoon brought an unexpected holiday, and
every one decided to go somewhere on the carpet, the journey had to
be undertaken without the Phoenix. They were debarred from any carpet
excursions in the evening by a sudden promise to mother, exacted in the
agitation of parting, that they would not be out after six at night,
except on Saturday, when they were to go to the bazaar, and were pledged
to put on their best clothes, to wash themselves to the uttermost, and
to clean their nails--not with scissors, which are scratchy and bad,
but with flat-sharpened ends of wooden matches, which do no harm to any
one’s nails.

‘Let’s go and see the Lamb,’ said Jane.

But every one was agreed that if they appeared suddenly in Bournemouth
it would frighten mother out of her wits, if not into a fit. So they
sat on the carpet, and thought and thought and thought till they almost
began to squint.

‘Look here,’ said Cyril, ‘I know. Please carpet, take us somewhere where
we can see the Lamb and mother and no one can see us.’

‘Except the Lamb,’ said Jane, quickly.

And the next moment they found themselves recovering from the
upside-down movement--and there they were sitting on the carpet, and
the carpet was laid out over another thick soft carpet of brown
pine-needles. There were green pine-trees overhead, and a swift clear
little stream was running as fast as ever it could between steep
banks--and there, sitting on the pine-needle carpet, was mother, without
her hat; and the sun was shining brightly, although it was November--and
there was the Lamb, as jolly as jolly and not whooping at all.

‘The carpet’s deceived us,’ said Robert, gloomily; ‘mother will see us
directly she turns her head.’

But the faithful carpet had not deceived them.

Mother turned her dear head and looked straight at them, and DID NOT SEE
THEM!

‘We’re invisible,’ Cyril whispered: ‘what awful larks!’

But to the girls it was not larks at all. It was horrible to have mother
looking straight at them, and her face keeping the same, just as though
they weren’t there.

‘I don’t like it,’ said Jane. ‘Mother never looked at us like that
before. Just as if she didn’t love us--as if we were somebody else’s
children, and not very nice ones either--as if she didn’t care whether
she saw us or not.’

‘It is horrid,’ said Anthea, almost in tears.

But at this moment the Lamb saw them, and plunged towards the carpet,
shrieking, ‘Panty, own Panty--an’ Pussy, an’ Squiggle--an’ Bobs, oh,
oh!’

Anthea caught him and kissed him, so did Jane; they could not help
it--he looked such a darling, with his blue three-cornered hat all on
one side, and his precious face all dirty--quite in the old familiar
way.

‘I love you, Panty; I love you--and you, and you, and you,’ cried the
Lamb.

It was a delicious moment. Even the boys thumped their baby brother
joyously on the back.

Then Anthea glanced at mother--and mother’s face was a pale sea-green
colour, and she was staring at the Lamb as if she thought he had gone
mad. And, indeed, that was exactly what she did think.

‘My Lamb, my precious! Come to mother,’ she cried, and jumped up and ran
to the baby.

She was so quick that the invisible children had to leap back, or she
would have felt them; and to feel what you can’t see is the worst sort
of ghost-feeling. Mother picked up the Lamb and hurried away from the
pinewood.

‘Let’s go home,’ said Jane, after a miserable silence. ‘It feels just
exactly as if mother didn’t love us.’

But they couldn’t bear to go home till they had seen mother meet another
lady, and knew that she was safe. You cannot leave your mother to go
green in the face in a distant pinewood, far from all human aid, and
then go home on your wishing carpet as though nothing had happened.

When mother seemed safe the children returned to the carpet, and said
‘Home’--and home they went.

‘I don’t care about being invisible myself,’ said Cyril, ‘at least, not
with my own family. It would be different if you were a prince, or a
bandit, or a burglar.’

And now the thoughts of all four dwelt fondly on the dear greenish face
of mother.

‘I wish she hadn’t gone away,’ said Jane; ‘the house is simply beastly
without her.’

‘I think we ought to do what she said,’ Anthea put in. ‘I saw something
in a book the other day about the wishes of the departed being sacred.’

‘That means when they’ve departed farther off,’ said Cyril. ‘India’s
coral or Greenland’s icy, don’t you know; not Bournemouth. Besides, we
don’t know what her wishes are.’

‘She SAID’--Anthea was very much inclined to cry--‘she said, “Get Indian
things for my bazaar;” but I know she thought we couldn’t, and it was
only play.’

‘Let’s get them all the same,’ said Robert. ‘We’ll go the first thing on
Saturday morning.’

And on Saturday morning, the first thing, they went.

There was no finding the Phoenix, so they sat on the beautiful wishing
carpet, and said--

‘We want Indian things for mother’s bazaar. Will you please take us
where people will give us heaps of Indian things?’

The docile carpet swirled their senses away, and restored them on the
outskirts of a gleaming white Indian town. They knew it was Indian at
once, by the shape of the domes and roofs; and besides, a man went by on
an elephant, and two English soldiers went along the road, talking like
in Mr Kipling’s books--so after that no one could have any doubt as to
where they were. They rolled up the carpet and Robert carried it, and
they walked bodily into the town.

It was very warm, and once more they had to take off their
London-in-November coats, and carry them on their arms.

The streets were narrow and strange, and the clothes of the people in
the streets were stranger and the talk of the people was strangest of
all.

‘I can’t understand a word,’ said Cyril. ‘How on earth are we to ask for
things for our bazaar?’

‘And they’re poor people, too,’ said Jane; ‘I’m sure they are. What we
want is a rajah or something.’

Robert was beginning to unroll the carpet, but the others stopped him,
imploring him not to waste a wish.

‘We asked the carpet to take us where we could get Indian things for
bazaars,’ said Anthea, ‘and it will.’

Her faith was justified.

Just as she finished speaking a very brown gentleman in a turban came
up to them and bowed deeply. He spoke, and they thrilled to the sound of
English words.

‘My ranee, she think you very nice childs. She asks do you lose
yourselves, and do you desire to sell carpet? She see you from her
palkee. You come see her--yes?’

They followed the stranger, who seemed to have a great many more teeth
in his smile than are usual, and he led them through crooked streets
to the ranee’s palace. I am not going to describe the ranee’s palace,
because I really have never seen the palace of a ranee, and Mr Kipling
has. So you can read about it in his books. But I know exactly what
happened there.

The old ranee sat on a low-cushioned seat, and there were a lot of other
ladies with her--all in trousers and veils, and sparkling with tinsel
and gold and jewels. And the brown, turbaned gentleman stood behind a
sort of carved screen, and interpreted what the children said and what
the queen said. And when the queen asked to buy the carpet, the children
said ‘No.’

‘Why?’ asked the ranee.

And Jane briefly said why, and the interpreter interpreted. The queen
spoke, and then the interpreter said--

‘My mistress says it is a good story, and you tell it all through
without thought of time.’

And they had to. It made a long story, especially as it had all to be
told twice--once by Cyril and once by the interpreter. Cyril rather
enjoyed himself. He warmed to his work, and told the tale of the Phoenix
and the Carpet, and the Lone Tower, and the Queen-Cook, in language that
grew insensibly more and more Arabian Nightsy, and the ranee and her
ladies listened to the interpreter, and rolled about on their fat
cushions with laughter.

When the story was ended she spoke, and the interpreter explained that
she had said, ‘Little one, thou art a heaven-born teller of tales,’ and
she threw him a string of turquoises from round her neck.

‘OH, how lovely!’ cried Jane and Anthea.

Cyril bowed several times, and then cleared his throat and said--

‘Thank her very, very much; but I would much rather she gave me some of
the cheap things in the bazaar. Tell her I want them to sell again, and
give the money to buy clothes for poor people who haven’t any.’

‘Tell him he has my leave to sell my gift and clothe the naked with its
price,’ said the queen, when this was translated.

But Cyril said very firmly, ‘No, thank you. The things have got to be
sold to-day at our bazaar, and no one would buy a turquoise necklace at
an English bazaar. They’d think it was sham, or else they’d want to know
where we got it.’

So then the queen sent out for little pretty things, and her servants
piled the carpet with them.

‘I must needs lend you an elephant to carry them away,’ she said,
laughing.

But Anthea said, ‘If the queen will lend us a comb and let us wash our
hands and faces, she shall see a magic thing. We and the carpet and all
these brass trays and pots and carved things and stuffs and things will
just vanish away like smoke.’

The queen clapped her hands at this idea, and lent the children a
sandal-wood comb inlaid with ivory lotus-flowers. And they washed their
faces and hands in silver basins. Then Cyril made a very polite farewell
speech, and quite suddenly he ended with the words--

‘And I wish we were at the bazaar at our schools.’

And of course they were. And the queen and her ladies were left with
their mouths open, gazing at the bare space on the inlaid marble floor
where the carpet and the children had been.

‘That is magic, if ever magic was!’ said the queen, delighted with the
incident; which, indeed, has given the ladies of that court something to
talk about on wet days ever since.

Cyril’s stories had taken some time, so had the meal of strange sweet
foods that they had had while the little pretty things were being
bought, and the gas in the schoolroom was already lighted. Outside, the
winter dusk was stealing down among the Camden Town houses.

‘I’m glad we got washed in India,’ said Cyril. ‘We should have been
awfully late if we’d had to go home and scrub.’

‘Besides,’ Robert said, ‘it’s much warmer washing in India. I shouldn’t
mind it so much if we lived there.’

The thoughtful carpet had dumped the children down in a dusky space
behind the point where the corners of two stalls met. The floor was
littered with string and brown paper, and baskets and boxes were heaped
along the wall.

The children crept out under a stall covered with all sorts of
table-covers and mats and things, embroidered beautifully by idle
ladies with no real work to do. They got out at the end, displacing a
sideboard-cloth adorned with a tasteful pattern of blue geraniums. The
girls got out unobserved, so did Cyril; but Robert, as he cautiously
emerged, was actually walked on by Mrs Biddle, who kept the stall. Her
large, solid foot stood firmly on the small, solid hand of Robert and
who can blame Robert if he DID yell a little?

A crowd instantly collected. Yells are very unusual at bazaars, and
every one was intensely interested. It was several seconds before the
three free children could make Mrs Biddle understand that what she
was walking on was not a schoolroom floor, or even, as she presently
supposed, a dropped pin-cushion, but the living hand of a suffering
child. When she became aware that she really had hurt him, she grew very
angry indeed. When people have hurt other people by accident, the one
who does the hurting is always much the angriest. I wonder why.

‘I’m very sorry, I’m sure,’ said Mrs Biddle; but she spoke more in anger
than in sorrow. ‘Come out! whatever do you mean by creeping about under
the stalls, like earwigs?’

‘We were looking at the things in the corner.’

‘Such nasty, prying ways,’ said Mrs Biddle, ‘will never make you
successful in life. There’s nothing there but packing and dust.’

‘Oh, isn’t there!’ said Jane. ‘That’s all you know.’

‘Little girl, don’t be rude,’ said Mrs Biddle, flushing violet.

‘She doesn’t mean to be; but there ARE some nice things there, all the
same,’ said Cyril; who suddenly felt how impossible it was to inform the
listening crowd that all the treasures piled on the carpet were mother’s
contributions to the bazaar. No one would believe it; and if they did,
and wrote to thank mother, she would think--well, goodness only knew
what she would think. The other three children felt the same.

‘I should like to see them,’ said a very nice lady, whose friends
had disappointed her, and who hoped that these might be belated
contributions to her poorly furnished stall.

She looked inquiringly at Robert, who said, ‘With pleasure, don’t
mention it,’ and dived back under Mrs Biddle’s stall.

‘I wonder you encourage such behaviour,’ said Mrs Biddle. ‘I always
speak my mind, as you know, Miss Peasmarsh; and, I must say, I am
surprised.’ She turned to the crowd. ‘There is no entertainment here,’
she said sternly. ‘A very naughty little boy has accidentally hurt
himself, but only slightly. Will you please disperse? It will only
encourage him in naughtiness if he finds himself the centre of
attraction.’

The crowd slowly dispersed. Anthea, speechless with fury, heard a nice
curate say, ‘Poor little beggar!’ and loved the curate at once and for
ever.

Then Robert wriggled out from under the stall with some Benares brass
and some inlaid sandalwood boxes.

‘Liberty!’ cried Miss Peasmarsh. ‘Then Charles has not forgotten, after
all.’

‘Excuse me,’ said Mrs Biddle, with fierce politeness, ‘these objects are
deposited behind MY stall. Some unknown donor who does good by stealth,
and would blush if he could hear you claim the things. Of course they
are for me.’

‘My stall touches yours at the corner,’ said poor Miss Peasmarsh,
timidly, ‘and my cousin did promise--’

The children sidled away from the unequal contest and mingled with
the crowd. Their feelings were too deep for words--till at last Robert
said--

‘That stiff-starched PIG!’

‘And after all our trouble! I’m hoarse with gassing to that trousered
lady in India.’

‘The pig-lady’s very, very nasty,’ said Jane.

It was Anthea who said, in a hurried undertone, ‘She isn’t very nice,
and Miss Peasmarsh is pretty and nice too. Who’s got a pencil?’

It was a long crawl, under three stalls, but Anthea did it. A large
piece of pale blue paper lay among the rubbish in the corner.

She folded it to a square and wrote upon it, licking the pencil at every
word to make it mark quite blackly: ‘All these Indian things are for
pretty, nice Miss Peasmarsh’s stall.’ She thought of adding, ‘There is
nothing for Mrs Biddle;’ but she saw that this might lead to suspicion,
so she wrote hastily: ‘From an unknown donna,’ and crept back among the
boards and trestles to join the others.

So that when Mrs Biddle appealed to the bazaar committee, and the corner
of the stall was lifted and shifted, so that stout clergymen and heavy
ladies could get to the corner without creeping under stalls, the blue
paper was discovered, and all the splendid, shining Indian things were
given over to Miss Peasmarsh, and she sold them all, and got thirty-five
pounds for them.

‘I don’t understand about that blue paper,’ said Mrs Biddle. ‘It looks
to me like the work of a lunatic. And saying you were nice and pretty!
It’s not the work of a sane person.’

Anthea and Jane begged Miss Peasmarsh to let them help her to sell the
things, because it was their brother who had announced the good news
that the things had come. Miss Peasmarsh was very willing, for now her
stall, that had been SO neglected, was surrounded by people who wanted
to buy, and she was glad to be helped. The children noted that Mrs
Biddle had not more to do in the way of selling than she could manage
quite well. I hope they were not glad--for you should forgive your
enemies, even if they walk on your hands and then say it is all your
naughty fault. But I am afraid they were not so sorry as they ought to
have been.

It took some time to arrange the things on the stall. The carpet was
spread over it, and the dark colours showed up the brass and silver and
ivory things. It was a happy and busy afternoon, and when Miss Peasmarsh
and the girls had sold every single one of the little pretty things from
the Indian bazaar, far, far away, Anthea and Jane went off with the
boys to fish in the fishpond, and dive into the bran-pie, and hear the
cardboard band, and the phonograph, and the chorus of singing birds that
was done behind a screen with glass tubes and glasses of water.

They had a beautiful tea, suddenly presented to them by the nice curate,
and Miss Peasmarsh joined them before they had had more than three cakes
each. It was a merry party, and the curate was extremely pleasant to
every one, ‘even to Miss Peasmarsh,’ as Jane said afterwards.

‘We ought to get back to the stall,’ said Anthea, when no one could
possibly eat any more, and the curate was talking in a low voice to Miss
Peas marsh about ‘after Easter’.

‘There’s nothing to go back for,’ said Miss Peasmarsh gaily; ‘thanks to
you dear children we’ve sold everything.’

‘There--there’s the carpet,’ said Cyril.

‘Oh,’ said Miss Peasmarsh, radiantly, ‘don’t bother about the carpet.
I’ve sold even that. Mrs Biddle gave me ten shillings for it. She said
it would do for her servant’s bedroom.’

‘Why,’ said Jane, ‘her servants don’t HAVE carpets. We had cook from
her, and she told us so.’

‘No scandal about Queen Elizabeth, if YOU please,’ said the curate,
cheerfully; and Miss Peasmarsh laughed, and looked at him as though she
had never dreamed that any one COULD be so amusing. But the others were
struck dumb. How could they say, ‘The carpet is ours!’ For who brings
carpets to bazaars?

The children were now thoroughly wretched. But I am glad to say that
their wretchedness did not make them forget their manners, as it does
sometimes, even with grown-up people, who ought to know ever so much
better.

They said, ‘Thank you very much for the jolly tea,’ and ‘Thanks for
being so jolly,’ and ‘Thanks awfully for giving us such a jolly time;’
for the curate had stood fish-ponds, and bran-pies, and phonographs, and
the chorus of singing birds, and had stood them like a man. The girls
hugged Miss Peasmarsh, and as they went away they heard the curate say--

‘Jolly little kids, yes, but what about--you will let it be directly
after Easter. Ah, do say you will--’

And Jane ran back and said, before Anthea could drag her away, ‘What are
you going to do after Easter?’

Miss Peasmarsh smiled and looked very pretty indeed. And the curate
said--

‘I hope I am going to take a trip to the Fortunate Islands.’

‘I wish we could take you on the wishing carpet,’ said Jane.

‘Thank you,’ said the curate, ‘but I’m afraid I can’t wait for that. I
must go to the Fortunate Islands before they make me a bishop. I should
have no time afterwards.’

‘I’ve always thought I should marry a bishop,’ said Jane: ‘his aprons
would come in so useful. Wouldn’t YOU like to marry a bishop, Miss
Peasmarsh?’

It was then that they dragged her away.

As it was Robert’s hand that Mrs Biddle had walked on, it was decided
that he had better not recall the incident to her mind, and so make
her angry again. Anthea and Jane had helped to sell things at the rival
stall, so they were not likely to be popular.

A hasty council of four decided that Mrs Biddle would hate Cyril less
than she would hate the others, so the others mingled with the crowd,
and it was he who said to her--

‘Mrs Biddle, WE meant to have that carpet. Would you sell it to us? We
would give you--’

‘Certainly not,’ said Mrs Biddle. ‘Go away, little boy.’

There was that in her tone which showed Cyril, all too plainly, the
hopelessness of persuasion. He found the others and said--

‘It’s no use; she’s like a lioness robbed of its puppies. We must watch
where it goes--and--Anthea, I don’t care what you say. It’s our own
carpet. It wouldn’t be burglary. It would be a sort of forlorn hope
rescue party--heroic and daring and dashing, and not wrong at all.’

The children still wandered among the gay crowd--but there was no
pleasure there for them any more. The chorus of singing birds sounded
just like glass tubes being blown through water, and the phonograph
simply made a horrid noise, so that you could hardly hear yourself
speak. And the people were buying things they couldn’t possibly want,
and it all seemed very stupid. And Mrs Biddle had bought the wishing
carpet for ten shillings. And the whole of life was sad and grey and
dusty, and smelt of slight gas escapes, and hot people, and cake and
crumbs, and all the children were very tired indeed.

They found a corner within sight of the carpet, and there they waited
miserably, till it was far beyond their proper bedtime. And when it was
ten the people who had bought things went away, but the people who had
been selling stayed to count up their money.

‘And to jaw about it,’ said Robert. ‘I’ll never go to another bazaar as
long as ever I live. My hand is swollen as big as a pudding. I expect
the nails in her horrible boots were poisoned.’

Just then some one who seemed to have a right to interfere said--

‘Everything is over now; you had better go home.’

So they went. And then they waited on the pavement under the gas lamp,
where ragged children had been standing all the evening to listen to
the band, and their feet slipped about in the greasy mud till Mrs Biddle
came out and was driven away in a cab with the many things she hadn’t
sold, and the few things she had bought--among others the carpet. The
other stall-holders left their things at the school till Monday morning,
but Mrs Biddle was afraid some one would steal some of them, so she took
them in a cab.

The children, now too desperate to care for mud or appearances, hung
on behind the cab till it reached Mrs Biddle’s house. When she and the
carpet had gone in and the door was shut Anthea said--

‘Don’t let’s burgle--I mean do daring and dashing rescue acts--till
we’ve given her a chance. Let’s ring and ask to see her.’

The others hated to do this, but at last they agreed, on condition that
Anthea would not make any silly fuss about the burglary afterwards, if
it really had to come to that.

So they knocked and rang, and a scared-looking parlourmaid opened the
front door. While they were asking for Mrs Biddle they saw her. She was
in the dining-room, and she had already pushed back the table and spread
out the carpet to see how it looked on the floor.

‘I knew she didn’t want it for her servants’ bedroom,’ Jane muttered.

Anthea walked straight past the uncomfortable parlourmaid, and the
others followed her. Mrs Biddle had her back to them, and was smoothing
down the carpet with the same boot that had trampled on the hand
of Robert. So that they were all in the room, and Cyril, with great
presence of mind, had shut the room door before she saw them.

‘Who is it, Jane?’ she asked in a sour voice; and then turning suddenly,
she saw who it was. Once more her face grew violet--a deep, dark violet.
‘You wicked daring little things!’ she cried, ‘how dare you come here?
At this time of night, too. Be off, or I’ll send for the police.’

‘Don’t be angry,’ said Anthea, soothingly, ‘we only wanted to ask you
to let us have the carpet. We have quite twelve shillings between us,
and--’

‘How DARE you?’ cried Mrs Biddle, and her voice shook with angriness.

‘You do look horrid,’ said Jane suddenly.

Mrs Biddle actually stamped that booted foot of hers. ‘You rude,
barefaced child!’ she said.

Anthea almost shook Jane; but Jane pushed forward in spite of her.

‘It really IS our nursery carpet,’ she said, ‘you ask ANY ONE if it
isn’t.’

‘Let’s wish ourselves home,’ said Cyril in a whisper.

‘No go,’ Robert whispered back, ‘she’d be there too, and raving mad as
likely as not. Horrid thing, I hate her!’

‘I wish Mrs Biddle was in an angelic good temper,’ cried Anthea,
suddenly. ‘It’s worth trying,’ she said to herself.

Mrs Biddle’s face grew from purple to violet, and from violet to mauve,
and from mauve to pink. Then she smiled quite a jolly smile.

‘Why, so I am!’ she said, ‘what a funny idea! Why shouldn’t I be in a
good temper, my dears.’

Once more the carpet had done its work, and not on Mrs Biddle alone. The
children felt suddenly good and happy.

‘You’re a jolly good sort,’ said Cyril. ‘I see that now. I’m sorry we
vexed you at the bazaar to-day.’

‘Not another word,’ said the changed Mrs Biddle. ‘Of course you shall
have the carpet, my dears, if you’ve taken such a fancy to it. No, no; I
won’t have more than the ten shillings I paid.’

‘It does seem hard to ask you for it after you bought it at the bazaar,’
said Anthea; ‘but it really IS our nursery carpet. It got to the bazaar
by mistake, with some other things.’

‘Did it really, now? How vexing!’ said Mrs Biddle, kindly. ‘Well, my
dears, I can very well give the extra ten shillings; so you take your
carpet and we’ll say no more about it. Have a piece of cake before you
go! I’m so sorry I stepped on your hand, my boy. Is it all right now?’

‘Yes, thank you,’ said Robert. ‘I say, you ARE good.’

‘Not at all,’ said Mrs Biddle, heartily. ‘I’m delighted to be able to
give any little pleasure to you dear children.’

And she helped them to roll up the carpet, and the boys carried it away
between them.

‘You ARE a dear,’ said Anthea, and she and Mrs Biddle kissed each other
heartily.


‘WELL!’ said Cyril as they went along the street.

‘Yes,’ said Robert, ‘and the odd part is that you feel just as if it
was REAL--her being so jolly, I mean--and not only the carpet making her
nice.’

‘Perhaps it IS real,’ said Anthea, ‘only it was covered up with
crossness and tiredness and things, and the carpet took them away.’

‘I hope it’ll keep them away,’ said Jane; ‘she isn’t ugly at all when
she laughs.’

The carpet has done many wonders in its day; but the case of Mrs
Biddle is, I think, the most wonderful. For from that day she was never
anything like so disagreeable as she was before, and she sent a lovely
silver tea-pot and a kind letter to Miss Peasmarsh when the pretty lady
married the nice curate; just after Easter it was, and they went to
Italy for their honeymoon.



CHAPTER 5. THE TEMPLE


‘I wish we could find the Phoenix,’ said Jane. ‘It’s much better company
than the carpet.’

‘Beastly ungrateful, little kids are,’ said Cyril.

‘No, I’m not; only the carpet never says anything, and it’s so helpless.
It doesn’t seem able to take care of itself. It gets sold, and taken
into the sea, and things like that. You wouldn’t catch the Phoenix
getting sold.’

It was two days after the bazaar. Every one was a little cross--some
days are like that, usually Mondays, by the way. And this was a Monday.

‘I shouldn’t wonder if your precious Phoenix had gone off for good,’
said Cyril; ‘and I don’t know that I blame it. Look at the weather!’

‘It’s not worth looking at,’ said Robert. And indeed it wasn’t.

‘The Phoenix hasn’t gone--I’m sure it hasn’t,’ said Anthea. ‘I’ll have
another look for it.’

Anthea looked under tables and chairs, and in boxes and baskets, in
mother’s work-bag and father’s portmanteau, but still the Phoenix showed
not so much as the tip of one shining feather.

Then suddenly Robert remembered how the whole of the Greek invocation
song of seven thousand lines had been condensed by him into one English
hexameter, so he stood on the carpet and chanted--

  ‘Oh, come along, come along, you good old beautiful Phoenix,’

and almost at once there was a rustle of wings down the kitchen stairs,
and the Phoenix sailed in on wide gold wings.

‘Where on earth HAVE you been?’ asked Anthea. ‘I’ve looked everywhere
for you.’

‘Not EVERYWHERE,’ replied the bird, ‘because you did not look in the
place where I was. Confess that that hallowed spot was overlooked by
you.’

‘WHAT hallowed spot?’ asked Cyril, a little impatiently, for time was
hastening on, and the wishing carpet still idle.

‘The spot,’ said the Phoenix, ‘which I hallowed by my golden presence
was the Lutron.’

‘The WHAT?’

‘The bath--the place of washing.’

‘I’m sure you weren’t,’ said Jane. ‘I looked there three times and moved
all the towels.’

‘I was concealed,’ said the Phoenix, ‘on the summit of a metal
column--enchanted, I should judge, for it felt warm to my golden toes,
as though the glorious sun of the desert shone ever upon it.’

‘Oh, you mean the cylinder,’ said Cyril: ‘it HAS rather a comforting
feel, this weather. And now where shall we go?’

And then, of course, the usual discussion broke out as to where they
should go and what they should do. And naturally, every one wanted to do
something that the others did not care about.

‘I am the eldest,’ Cyril remarked, ‘let’s go to the North Pole.’

‘This weather! Likely!’ Robert rejoined. ‘Let’s go to the Equator.’

‘I think the diamond mines of Golconda would be nice,’ said Anthea;
‘don’t you agree, Jane?’

‘No, I don’t,’ retorted Jane, ‘I don’t agree with you. I don’t agree
with anybody.’

The Phoenix raised a warning claw.

‘If you cannot agree among yourselves, I fear I shall have to leave
you,’ it said.

‘Well, where shall we go? You decide!’ said all.

‘If I were you,’ said the bird, thoughtfully, ‘I should give the carpet
a rest. Besides, you’ll lose the use of your legs if you go everywhere
by carpet. Can’t you take me out and explain your ugly city to me?’

‘We will if it clears up,’ said Robert, without enthusiasm. ‘Just look
at the rain. And why should we give the carpet a rest?’

‘Are you greedy and grasping, and heartless and selfish?’ asked the
bird, sharply.

‘NO!’ said Robert, with indignation.

‘Well then!’ said the Phoenix. ‘And as to the rain--well, I am not fond
of rain myself. If the sun knew _I_ was here--he’s very fond of shining
on me because I look so bright and golden. He always says I repay a
little attention. Haven’t you some form of words suitable for use in wet
weather?’

‘There’s “Rain, rain, go away,”’ said Anthea; ‘but it never DOES go.’

‘Perhaps you don’t say the invocation properly,’ said the bird.

     ‘Rain, rain, go away,
     Come again another day,
     Little baby wants to play,’

said Anthea.

‘That’s quite wrong; and if you say it in that sort of dull way, I can
quite understand the rain not taking any notice. You should open the
window and shout as loud as you can--

     ‘Rain, rain, go away,
     Come again another day;
     Now we want the sun, and so,
     Pretty rain, be kind and go!

‘You should always speak politely to people when you want them to do
things, and especially when it’s going away that you want them to do.
And to-day you might add--

     ‘Shine, great sun, the lovely Phoe-
     Nix is here, and wants to be
     Shone on, splendid sun, by thee!’

‘That’s poetry!’ said Cyril, decidedly.

‘It’s like it,’ said the more cautious Robert.

‘I was obliged to put in “lovely”,’ said the Phoenix, modestly, ‘to make
the line long enough.’

‘There are plenty of nasty words just that length,’ said Jane; but every
one else said ‘Hush!’ And then they opened the window and shouted the
seven lines as loud as they could, and the Phoenix said all the words
with them, except ‘lovely’, and when they came to that it looked down
and coughed bashfully.

The rain hesitated a moment and then went away.

‘There’s true politeness,’ said the Phoenix, and the next moment it was
perched on the window-ledge, opening and shutting its radiant wings and
flapping out its golden feathers in such a flood of glorious sunshine as
you sometimes have at sunset in autumn time. People said afterwards that
there had not been such sunshine in December for years and years and
years.

‘And now,’ said the bird, ‘we will go out into the city, and you shall
take me to see one of my temples.’

‘Your temples?’

‘I gather from the carpet that I have many temples in this land.’

‘I don’t see how you CAN find anything out from it,’ said Jane: ‘it
never speaks.’

‘All the same, you can pick up things from a carpet,’ said the bird;
‘I’ve seen YOU do it. And I have picked up several pieces of information
in this way. That papyrus on which you showed me my picture--I
understand that it bears on it the name of the street of your city in
which my finest temple stands, with my image graved in stone and in
metal over against its portal.’

‘You mean the fire insurance office,’ said Robert. ‘It’s not really a
temple, and they don’t--’

‘Excuse me,’ said the Phoenix, coldly, ‘you are wholly misinformed. It
IS a temple, and they do.’

‘Don’t let’s waste the sunshine,’ said Anthea; ‘we might argue as we go
along, to save time.’

So the Phoenix consented to make itself a nest in the breast of Robert’s
Norfolk jacket, and they all went out into the splendid sunshine. The
best way to the temple of the Phoenix seemed to be to take the tram, and
on the top of it the children talked, while the Phoenix now and then
put out a wary beak, cocked a cautious eye, and contradicted what the
children were saying.

It was a delicious ride, and the children felt how lucky they were to
have had the money to pay for it. They went with the tram as far as it
went, and when it did not go any farther they stopped too, and got off.
The tram stops at the end of the Gray’s Inn Road, and it was Cyril
who thought that one might well find a short cut to the Phoenix Office
through the little streets and courts that lie tightly packed between
Fetter Lane and Ludgate Circus. Of course, he was quite mistaken, as
Robert told him at the time, and afterwards Robert did not forbear to
remind his brother how he had said so. The streets there were small
and stuffy and ugly, and crowded with printers’ boys and binders’ girls
coming out from work; and these stared so hard at the pretty red coats
and caps of the sisters that they wished they had gone some other way.
And the printers and binders made very personal remarks, advising Jane
to get her hair cut, and inquiring where Anthea had bought that hat.
Jane and Anthea scorned to reply, and Cyril and Robert found that they
were hardly a match for the rough crowd. They could think of nothing
nasty enough to say. They turned a corner sharply, and then Anthea
pulled Jane into an archway, and then inside a door; Cyril and Robert
quickly followed, and the jeering crowd passed by without seein them.

Anthea drew a long breath.

‘How awful!’ she said. ‘I didn’t know there were such people, except in
books.’

‘It was a bit thick; but it’s partly you girls’ fault, coming out in
those flashy coats.’

‘We thought we ought to, when we were going out with the Phoenix,’ said
Jane; and the bird said, ‘Quite right, too’--and incautiously put out
his head to give her a wink of encouragement.

And at the same instant a dirty hand reached through the grim balustrade
of the staircase beside them and clutched the Phoenix, and a hoarse
voice said--

‘I say, Urb, blowed if this ain’t our Poll parrot what we lost. Thank
you very much, lidy, for bringin’ ‘im home to roost.’

The four turned swiftly. Two large and ragged boys were crouched amid
the dark shadows of the stairs. They were much larger than Robert and
Cyril, and one of them had snatched the Phoenix away and was holding it
high above their heads.

‘Give me that bird,’ said Cyril, sternly: ‘it’s ours.’

‘Good arternoon, and thankin’ you,’ the boy went on, with maddening
mockery. ‘Sorry I can’t give yer tuppence for yer trouble--but I’ve
‘ad to spend my fortune advertising for my vallyable bird in all the
newspapers. You can call for the reward next year.’

‘Look out, Ike,’ said his friend, a little anxiously; ‘it ‘ave a beak on
it.’

‘It’s other parties as’ll have the Beak on to ‘em presently,’ said Ike,
darkly, ‘if they come a-trying to lay claims on my Poll parrot. You just
shut up, Urb. Now then, you four little gells, get out er this.’

‘Little girls!’ cried Robert. ‘I’ll little girl you!’

He sprang up three stairs and hit out.

There was a squawk--the most bird-like noise any one had ever heard
from the Phoenix--and a fluttering, and a laugh in the darkness, and Ike
said--

‘There now, you’ve been and gone and strook my Poll parrot right in the
fevvers--strook ‘im something crool, you ‘ave.’

Robert stamped with fury. Cyril felt himself growing pale with rage,
and with the effort of screwing up his brain to make it clever enough to
think of some way of being even with those boys. Anthea and Jane were as
angry as the boys, but it made them want to cry. Yet it was Anthea who
said--

‘Do, PLEASE, let us have the bird.’

‘Dew, PLEASE, get along and leave us an’ our bird alone.’

‘If you don’t,’ said Anthea, ‘I shall fetch the police.’

‘You better!’ said he who was named Urb. ‘Say, Ike, you twist the
bloomin’ pigeon’s neck; he ain’t worth tuppence.’

‘Oh, no,’ cried Jane, ‘don’t hurt it. Oh, don’t; it is such a pet.’

‘I won’t hurt it,’ said Ike; ‘I’m ‘shamed of you, Urb, for to think of
such a thing. Arf a shiner, miss, and the bird is yours for life.’

‘Half a WHAT?’ asked Anthea.

‘Arf a shiner, quid, thick ‘un--half a sov, then.’

‘I haven’t got it--and, besides, it’s OUR bird,’ said Anthea.

‘Oh, don’t talk to him,’ said Cyril and then Jane said suddenly--

‘Phoenix--dear Phoenix, we can’t do anything. YOU must manage it.’

‘With pleasure,’ said the Phoenix--and Ike nearly dropped it in his
amazement.

‘I say, it do talk, suthin’ like,’ said he.

‘Youths,’ said the Phoenix, ‘sons of misfortune, hear my words.’

‘My eyes!’ said Ike.

‘Look out, Ike,’ said Urb, ‘you’ll throttle the joker--and I see at
wunst ‘e was wuth ‘is weight in flimsies.’00

‘Hearken, O Eikonoclastes, despiser of sacred images--and thou, Urbanus,
dweller in the sordid city. Forbear this adventure lest a worse thing
befall.’

‘Luv’ us!’ said Ike, ‘ain’t it been taught its schoolin’ just!’

‘Restore me to my young acolytes and escape unscathed. Retain me--and--’

‘They must ha’ got all this up, case the Polly got pinched,’ said Ike.
‘Lor’ lumme, the artfulness of them young uns!’

‘I say, slosh ‘em in the geseech and get clear off with the swag’s wot I
say,’ urged Herbert.

‘Right O,’ said Isaac.

‘Forbear,’ repeated the Phoenix, sternly. ‘Who pinched the click off of
the old bloke in Aldermanbury?’ it added, in a changed tone.

‘Who sneaked the nose-rag out of the young gell’s ‘and in Bell Court?
Who--’

‘Stow it,’ said Ike. ‘You! ugh! yah!--leave go of me. Bash him off, Urb;
‘e’ll have my bloomin’ eyes outer my ed.’

There were howls, a scuffle, a flutter; Ike and Urb fled up the stairs,
and the Phoenix swept out through the doorway. The children followed and
the Phoenix settled on Robert, ‘like a butterfly on a rose,’ as Anthea
said afterwards, and wriggled into the breast of his Norfolk jacket,
‘like an eel into mud,’ as Cyril later said.

‘Why ever didn’t you burn him? You could have, couldn’t you?’ asked
Robert, when the hurried flight through the narrow courts had ended in
the safe wideness of Farringdon Street.

‘I could have, of course,’ said the bird, ‘but I didn’t think it would
be dignified to allow myself to get warm about a little thing like that.
The Fates, after all, have not been illiberal to me. I have a good many
friends among the London sparrows, and I have a beak and claws.’

These happenings had somewhat shaken the adventurous temper of the
children, and the Phoenix had to exert its golden self to hearten them
up.

Presently the children came to a great house in Lombard Street, and
there, on each side of the door, was the image of the Phoenix carved in
stone, and set forth on shining brass were the words--

     PHOENIX FIRE OFFICE


‘One moment,’ said the bird. ‘Fire? For altars, I suppose?’

‘_I_ don’t know,’ said Robert; he was beginning to feel shy, and that
always made him rather cross.

‘Oh, yes, you do,’ Cyril contradicted. ‘When people’s houses are burnt
down the Phoenix gives them new houses. Father told me; I asked him.’

‘The house, then, like the Phoenix, rises from its ashes? Well have my
priests dealt with the sons of men!’

‘The sons of men pay, you know,’ said Anthea; ‘but it’s only a little
every year.’

‘That is to maintain my priests,’ said the bird, ‘who, in the hour of
affliction, heal sorrows and rebuild houses. Lead on; inquire for the
High Priest. I will not break upon them too suddenly in all my glory.
Noble and honour-deserving are they who make as nought the evil deeds of
the lame-footed and unpleasing Hephaestus.’

‘I don’t know what you’re talking about, and I wish you wouldn’t muddle
us with new names. Fire just happens. Nobody does it--not as a deed,
you know,’ Cyril explained. ‘If they did the Phoenix wouldn’t help them,
because its a crime to set fire to things. Arsenic, or something they
call it, because it’s as bad as poisoning people. The Phoenix wouldn’t
help THEM--father told me it wouldn’t.’

‘My priests do well,’ said the Phoenix. ‘Lead on.’

‘I don’t know what to say,’ said Cyril; and the Others said the same.

‘Ask for the High Priest,’ said the Phoenix. ‘Say that you have a
secret to unfold that concerns my worship, and he will lead you to the
innermost sanctuary.’

So the children went in, all four of them, though they didn’t like it,
and stood in a large and beautiful hall adorned with Doulton tiles,
like a large and beautiful bath with no water in it, and stately pillars
supporting the roof. An unpleasing representation of the Phoenix in
brown pottery disfigured one wall. There were counters and desks of
mahogany and brass, and clerks bent over the desks and walked behind the
counters. There was a great clock over an inner doorway.

‘Inquire for the High Priest,’ whispered the Phoenix.

An attentive clerk in decent black, who controlled his mouth but not his
eyebrows, now came towards them. He leaned forward on the counter, and
the children thought he was going to say, ‘What can I have the pleasure
of showing you?’ like in a draper’s; instead of which the young man
said--

‘And what do YOU want?’

‘We want to see the High Priest.’

‘Get along with you,’ said the young man.

An elder man, also decent in black coat, advanced.

‘Perhaps it’s Mr Blank’ (not for worlds would I give the name). ‘He’s a
Masonic High Priest, you know.’

A porter was sent away to look for Mr Asterisk (I cannot give his name),
and the children were left there to look on and be looked on by all
the gentlemen at the mahogany desks. Anthea and Jane thought that they
looked kind. The boys thought they stared, and that it was like their
cheek.

The porter returned with the news that Mr Dot Dash Dot (I dare not
reveal his name) was out, but that Mr--

Here a really delightful gentleman appeared. He had a beard and a kind
and merry eye, and each one of the four knew at once that this was a man
who had kiddies of his own and could understand what you were talking
about. Yet it was a difficult thing to explain.

‘What is it?’ he asked. ‘Mr’--he named the name which I will never
reveal--‘is out. Can I do anything?’

‘Inner sanctuary,’ murmured the Phoenix.

‘I beg your pardon,’ said the nice gentleman, who thought it was Robert
who had spoken.

‘We have something to tell you,’ said Cyril, ‘but’--he glanced at the
porter, who was lingering much nearer than he need have done--‘this is a
very public place.’

The nice gentleman laughed.

‘Come upstairs then,’ he said, and led the way up a wide and beautiful
staircase. Anthea says the stairs were of white marble, but I am not
sure. On the corner-post of the stairs, at the top, was a beautiful
image of the Phoenix in dark metal, and on the wall at each side was a
flat sort of image of it.

The nice gentleman led them into a room where the chairs, and even the
tables, were covered with reddish leather. He looked at the children
inquiringly.

‘Don’t be frightened,’ he said; ‘tell me exactly what you want.’

‘May I shut the door?’ asked Cyril.

The gentleman looked surprised, but he shut the door.

‘Now,’ said Cyril, firmly, ‘I know you’ll be awfully surprised, and
you’ll think it’s not true and we are lunatics; but we aren’t, and it
is. Robert’s got something inside his Norfolk--that’s Robert, he’s my
young brother. Now don’t be upset and have a fit or anything sir. Of
course, I know when you called your shop the “Phoenix” you never thought
there was one; but there is--and Robert’s got it buttoned up against his
chest!’

‘If it’s an old curio in the form of a Phoenix, I dare say the Board--’
said the nice gentleman, as Robert began to fumble with his buttons.

‘It’s old enough,’ said Anthea, ‘going by what it says, but--’

‘My goodness gracious!’ said the gentleman, as the Phoenix, with one
last wriggle that melted into a flutter, got out of its nest in the
breast of Robert and stood up on the leather-covered table.

‘What an extraordinarily fine bird!’ he went on. ‘I don’t think I ever
saw one just like it.’

‘I should think not,’ said the Phoenix, with pardonable pride. And the
gentleman jumped.

‘Oh, it’s been taught to speak! Some sort of parrot, perhaps?’

‘I am,’ said the bird, simply, ‘the Head of your House, and I have come
to my temple to receive your homage. I am no parrot’--its beak curved
scornfully--‘I am the one and only Phoenix, and I demand the homage of
my High Priest.’

‘In the absence of our manager,’ the gentleman began, exactly as though
he were addressing a valued customer--‘in the absence of our manager, I
might perhaps be able--What am I saying?’ He turned pale, and passed
his hand across his brow. ‘My dears,’ he said, ‘the weather is unusually
warm for the time of year, and I don’t feel quite myself. Do you know,
for a moment I really thought that that remarkable bird of yours had
spoken and said it was the Phoenix, and, what’s more, that I’d believed
it.’

‘So it did, sir,’ said Cyril, ‘and so did you.’

‘It really--Allow me.’

A bell was rung. The porter appeared.

‘Mackenzie,’ said the gentleman, ‘you see that golden bird?’

‘Yes, sir.’

The other breathed a sigh of relief.

‘It IS real, then?’

‘Yes, sir, of course, sir. You take it in your hand, sir,’ said the
porter, sympathetically, and reached out his hand to the Phoenix, who
shrank back on toes curved with agitated indignation.

‘Forbear!’ it cried; ‘how dare you seek to lay hands on me?’

The porter saluted.

‘Beg pardon, sir,’ he said, ‘I thought you was a bird.’

‘I AM a bird--THE bird--the Phoenix.’

‘Of course you are, sir,’ said the porter. ‘I see that the first minute,
directly I got my breath, sir.’

‘That will do,’ said the gentleman. ‘Ask Mr Wilson and Mr Sterry to step
up here for a moment, please.’

Mr Sterry and Mr Wilson were in their turn overcome by
amazement--quickly followed by conviction. To the surprise of the
children every one in the office took the Phoenix at its word, and after
the first shock of surprise it seemed to be perfectly natural to every
one that the Phoenix should be alive, and that, passing through London,
it should call at its temple.

‘We ought to have some sort of ceremony,’ said the nicest
gentleman, anxiously. ‘There isn’t time to summon the directors and
shareholders--we might do that tomorrow, perhaps. Yes, the board-room
would be best. I shouldn’t like it to feel we hadn’t done everything in
our power to show our appreciation of its condescension in looking in on
us in this friendly way.’

The children could hardly believe their ears, for they had never thought
that any one but themselves would believe in the Phoenix. And yet every
one did; all the men in the office were brought in by twos and threes,
and the moment the Phoenix opened its beak it convinced the cleverest
of them, as well as those who were not so clever. Cyril wondered how the
story would look in the papers next day. He seemed to see the posters in
the streets:

    PHOENIX FIRE OFFICE
    THE PHOENIX AT ITS TEMPLE
    MEETING TO WELCOME IT
    DELIGHT OF THE MANAGER AND EVERYBODY.

‘Excuse our leaving you a moment,’ said the nice gentleman, and he went
away with the others; and through the half-closed door the children
could hear the sound of many boots on stairs, the hum of excited voices
explaining, suggesting, arguing, the thumpy drag of heavy furniture
being moved about.

The Phoenix strutted up and down the leather-covered table, looking over
its shoulder at its pretty back.

‘You see what a convincing manner I have,’ it said proudly.

And now a new gentleman came in and said, bowing low--

‘Everything is prepared--we have done our best at so short a notice; the
meeting--the ceremony--will be in the board-room. Will the Honourable
Phoenix walk--it is only a few steps--or would it like to be--would it
like some sort of conveyance?’

‘My Robert will bear me to the board-room, if that be the unlovely name
of my temple’s inmost court,’ replied the bird.

So they all followed the gentleman. There was a big table in the
board-room, but it had been pushed right up under the long windows at
one side, and chairs were arranged in rows across the room--like those
you have at schools when there is a magic lantern on ‘Our Eastern
Empire’, or on ‘The Way We Do in the Navy’. The doors were of carved
wood, very beautiful, with a carved Phoenix above. Anthea noticed that
the chairs in the front rows were of the kind that her mother so loved
to ask the price of in old furniture shops, and never could buy, because
the price was always nearly twenty pounds each. On the mantelpiece were
some heavy bronze candlesticks and a clock, and on the top of the clock
was another image of the Phoenix.

‘Remove that effigy,’ said the Phoenix to the gentlemen who were there,
and it was hastily taken down. Then the Phoenix fluttered to the middle
of the mantelpiece and stood there, looking more golden than ever. Then
every one in the house and the office came in--from the cashier to the
women who cooked the clerks’ dinners in the beautiful kitchen at the top
of the house. And every one bowed to the Phoenix and then sat down in a
chair.

‘Gentlemen,’ said the nicest gentleman, ‘we have met here today--’

The Phoenix was turning its golden beak from side to side.

‘I don’t notice any incense,’ it said, with an injured sniff. A hurried
consultation ended in plates being fetched from the kitchen. Brown
sugar, sealing-wax, and tobacco were placed on these, and something from
a square bottle was poured over it all. Then a match was applied. It was
the only incense that was handy in the Phoenix office, and it certainly
burned very briskly and smoked a great deal.

‘We have met here today,’ said the gentleman again, ‘on an occasion
unparalleled in the annals of this office. Our respected Phoenix--’

‘Head of the House,’ said the Phoenix, in a hollow voice.

‘I was coming to that. Our respected Phoenix, the Head of this ancient
House, has at length done us the honour to come among us. I think I may
say, gentlemen, that we are not insensible to this honour, and that we
welcome with no uncertain voice one whom we have so long desired to see
in our midst.’

Several of the younger clerks thought of saying ‘Hear, hear,’ but they
feared it might seem disrespectful to the bird.

‘I will not take up your time,’ the speaker went on, ‘by recapitulating
the advantages to be derived from a proper use of our system of fire
insurance. I know, and you know, gentlemen, that our aim has ever been
to be worthy of that eminent bird whose name we bear, and who now adorns
our mantelpiece with his presence. Three cheers, gentlemen, for the
winged Head of the House!’

The cheers rose, deafening. When they had died away the Phoenix was
asked to say a few words.

It expressed in graceful phrases the pleasure it felt in finding itself
at last in its own temple.

‘And,’ it went on, ‘You must not think me wanting in appreciation of
your very hearty and cordial reception when I ask that an ode may be
recited or a choric song sung. It is what I have always been accustomed
to.’

The four children, dumb witnesses of this wonderful scene, glanced a
little nervously across the foam of white faces above the sea of black
coats. It seemed to them that the Phoenix was really asking a little too
much.

‘Time presses,’ said the Phoenix, ‘and the original ode of invocation is
long, as well as being Greek; and, besides, it’s no use invoking me when
here I am; but is there not a song in your own tongue for a great day
such as this?’

Absently the manager began to sing, and one by one the rest joined--

     ‘Absolute security!
     No liability!
     All kinds of property
     insured against fire.
     Terms most favourable,
     Expenses reasonable,
     Moderate rates for annual
     Insurance.’

‘That one is NOT my favourite,’ interrupted the Phoenix, ‘and I think
you’ve forgotten part of it.’

The manager hastily began another--

     ‘O Golden Phoenix, fairest bird,
     The whole great world has often heard
     Of all the splendid things we do,
     Great Phoenix, just to honour you.’

‘That’s better,’ said the bird. And every one sang--

     ‘Class one, for private dwelling-house,
     For household goods and shops allows;
     Provided these are built of brick
     Or stone, and tiled and slated thick.’

‘Try another verse,’ said the Phoenix, ‘further on.’

And again arose the voices of all the clerks and employees and managers
and secretaries and cooks--

    ‘In Scotland our insurance yields
     The price of burnt-up stacks in fields.’

‘Skip that verse,’ said the Phoenix.

     ‘Thatched dwellings and their whole contents
     We deal with--also with their rents;
     Oh, glorious Phoenix, look and see
     That these are dealt with in class three.

     ‘The glories of your temple throng
     Too thick to go in any song;
     And we attend, O good and wise,
     To “days of grace” and merchandise.

     ‘When people’s homes are burned away
     They never have a cent to pay
     If they have done as all should do,
     O Phoenix, and have honoured you.

     ‘So let us raise our voice and sing
     The praises of the Phoenix King.
     In classes one and two and three,
     Oh, trust to him, for kind is he!’

‘I’m sure YOU’RE very kind,’ said the Phoenix; ‘and now we must be
going. An thank you very much for a very pleasant time. May you all
prosper as you deserve to do, for I am sure a nicer, pleasanter-spoken
lot of temple attendants I have never met, and never wish to meet. I
wish you all good-day!’

It fluttered to the wrist of Robert and drew the four children from the
room. The whole of the office staff followed down the wide stairs and
filed into their accustomed places, and the two most important officials
stood on the steps bowing till Robert had buttoned the golden bird in
his Norfolk bosom, and it and he and the three other children were lost
in the crowd.

The two most important gentlemen looked at each other earnestly and
strangely for a moment, and then retreated to those sacred inner rooms,
where they toil without ceasing for the good of the House.

And the moment they were all in their places--managers, secretaries,
clerks, and porters--they all started, and each looked cautiously round
to see if any one was looking at him. For each thought that he had
fallen asleep for a few minutes, and had dreamed a very odd dream about
the Phoenix and the board-room. And, of course, no one mentioned it
to any one else, because going to sleep at your office is a thing you
simply MUST NOT do.

The extraordinary confusion of the board-room, with the remains of the
incense in the plates, would have shown them at once that the visit of
the Phoenix had been no dream, but a radiant reality, but no one went
into the board-room again that day; and next day, before the office
was opened, it was all cleaned and put nice and tidy by a lady whose
business asking questions was not part of. That is why Cyril read
the papers in vain on the next day and the day after that; because no
sensible person thinks his dreams worth putting in the paper, and no one
will ever own that he has been asleep in the daytime.

The Phoenix was very pleased, but it decided to write an ode for itself.
It thought the ones it had heard at its temple had been too hastily
composed. Its own ode began--

     ‘For beauty and for modest worth
     The Phoenix has not its equal on earth.’

And when the children went to bed that night it was still trying to cut
down the last line to the proper length without taking out any of what
it wanted to say.

That is what makes poetry so difficult.



CHAPTER 6. DOING GOOD


‘We shan’t be able to go anywhere on the carpet for a whole week,
though,’ said Robert.

‘And I’m glad of it,’ said Jane, unexpectedly.

‘Glad?’ said Cyril; ‘GLAD?’

It was breakfast-time, and mother’s letter, telling them how they were
all going for Christmas to their aunt’s at Lyndhurst, and how father and
mother would meet them there, having been read by every one, lay on the
table, drinking hot bacon-fat with one corner and eating marmalade with
the other.

‘Yes, glad,’ said Jane. ‘I don’t want any more things to happen
just now. I feel like you do when you’ve been to three parties in a
week--like we did at granny’s once--and extras in between, toys and
chocs and things like that. I want everything to be just real, and no
fancy things happening at all.’ ‘I don’t like being obliged to keep
things from mother,’ said Anthea. ‘I don’t know why, but it makes me
feel selfish and mean.’

‘If we could only get the mater to believe it, we might take her to the
jolliest places,’ said Cyril, thoughtfully. ‘As it is, we’ve just got to
be selfish and mean--if it is that--but I don’t feel it is.’

‘I KNOW it isn’t, but I FEEL it is,’ said Anthea, ‘and that’s just as
bad.’

‘It’s worse,’ said Robert; ‘if you knew it and didn’t feel it, it
wouldn’t matter so much.’

‘That’s being a hardened criminal, father says,’ put in Cyril, and he
picked up mother’s letter and wiped its corners with his handkerchief,
to whose colour a trifle of bacon-fat and marmalade made but little
difference.

‘We’re going to-morrow, anyhow,’ said Robert. ‘Don’t,’ he added, with
a good-boy expression on his face--‘don’t let’s be ungrateful for our
blessings; don’t let’s waste the day in saying how horrid it is to keep
secrets from mother, when we all know Anthea tried all she knew to give
her the secret, and she wouldn’t take it. Let’s get on the carpet and
have a jolly good wish. You’ll have time enough to repent of things all
next week.’

‘Yes,’ said Cyril, ‘let’s. It’s not really wrong.’

‘Well, look here,’ said Anthea. ‘You know there’s something about
Christmas that makes you want to be good--however little you wish it at
other times. Couldn’t we wish the carpet to take us somewhere where we
should have the chance to do some good and kind action? It would be an
adventure just the same,’ she pleaded.

‘I don’t mind,’ said Cyril. ‘We shan’t know where we’re going, and
that’ll be exciting. No one knows what’ll happen. We’d best put on our
outers in case--’

‘We might rescue a traveller buried in the snow, like St Bernard dogs,
with barrels round our necks,’ said Jane, beginning to be interested.

‘Or we might arrive just in time to witness a will being signed--more
tea, please,’ said Robert, ‘and we should see the old man hide it away
in the secret cupboard; and then, after long years, when the rightful
heir was in despair, we should lead him to the hidden panel and--’

‘Yes,’ interrupted Anthea; ‘or we might be taken to some freezing garret
in a German town, where a poor little pale, sick child--’

‘We haven’t any German money,’ interrupted Cyril, ‘so THAT’S no go. What
I should like would be getting into the middle of a war and getting hold
of secret intelligence and taking it to the general, and he would make
me a lieutenant or a scout, or a hussar.’

When breakfast was cleared away, Anthea swept the carpet, and the
children sat down on it, together with the Phoenix, who had been
especially invited, as a Christmas treat, to come with them and witness
the good and kind action they were about to do.

Four children and one bird were ready, and the wish was wished.

Every one closed its eyes, so as to feel the topsy-turvy swirl of the
carpet’s movement as little as possible.

When the eyes were opened again the children found themselves on the
carpet, and the carpet was in its proper place on the floor of their own
nursery at Camden Town.

‘I say,’ said Cyril, ‘here’s a go!’

‘Do you think it’s worn out? The wishing part of it, I mean?’ Robert
anxiously asked the Phoenix.

‘It’s not that,’ said the Phoenix; ‘but--well--what did you wish--?’

‘Oh! I see what it means,’ said Robert, with deep disgust; ‘it’s like
the end of a fairy story in a Sunday magazine. How perfectly beastly!’

‘You mean it means we can do kind and good actions where we are? I see.
I suppose it wants us to carry coals for the cook or make clothes
for the bare heathens. Well, I simply won’t. And the last day and
everything. Look here!’ Cyril spoke loudly and firmly. ‘We want to go
somewhere really interesting, where we have a chance of doing something
good and kind; we don’t want to do it here, but somewhere else. See?
Now, then.’

The obedient carpet started instantly, and the four children and one
bird fell in a heap together, and as they fell were plunged in perfect
darkness.

‘Are you all there?’ said Anthea, breathlessly, through the black dark.
Every one owned that it was there.

‘Where are we? Oh! how shivery and wet it is! Ugh!--oh!--I’ve put my
hand in a puddle!’

‘Has any one got any matches?’ said Anthea, hopelessly. She felt sure
that no one would have any.

It was then that Robert, with a radiant smile of triumph that was quite
wasted in the darkness, where, of course, no one could see anything,
drew out of his pocket a box of matches, struck a match and lighted a
candle--two candles. And every one, with its mouth open, blinked at the
sudden light.

‘Well done Bobs,’ said his sisters, and even Cyril’s natural brotherly
feelings could not check his admiration of Robert’s foresight.

‘I’ve always carried them about ever since the lone tower day,’ said
Robert, with modest pride. ‘I knew we should want them some day. I kept
the secret well, didn’t I?’

‘Oh, yes,’ said Cyril, with fine scorn. ‘I found them the Sunday after,
when I was feeling in your Norfolks for the knife you borrowed off me.
But I thought you’d only sneaked them for Chinese lanterns, or reading
in bed by.’

‘Bobs,’ said Anthea, suddenly, ‘do you know where we are? This is
the underground passage, and look there--there’s the money and the
money-bags, and everything.’

By this time the ten eyes had got used to the light of the candles, and
no one could help seeing that Anthea spoke the truth.

‘It seems an odd place to do good and kind acts in, though,’ said Jane.
‘There’s no one to do them to.’

‘Don’t you be too sure,’ said Cyril; ‘just round the next turning we
might find a prisoner who has languished here for years and years, and
we could take him out on our carpet and restore him to his sorrowing
friends.’

‘Of course we could,’ said Robert, standing up and holding the candle
above his head to see further off; ‘or we might find the bones of a
poor prisoner and take them to his friends to be buried properly--that’s
always a kind action in books, though I never could see what bones
matter.’

‘I wish you wouldn’t,’ said Jane.

‘I know exactly where we shall find the bones, too,’ Robert went on.
‘You see that dark arch just along the passage? Well, just inside
there--’

‘If you don’t stop going on like that,’ said Jane, firmly, ‘I shall
scream, and then I’ll faint--so now then!’

‘And _I_ will, too,’ said Anthea.

Robert was not pleased at being checked in his flight of fancy.

‘You girls will never be great writers,’ he said bitterly. ‘They just
love to think of things in dungeons, and chains, and knobbly bare human
bones, and--’

Jane had opened her mouth to scream, but before she could decide how you
began when you wanted to faint, the golden voice of the Phoenix spoke
through the gloom.

‘Peace!’ it said; ‘there are no bones here except the small but useful
sets that you have inside you. And you did not invite me to come out
with you to hear you talk about bones, but to see you do some good and
kind action.’

‘We can’t do it here,’ said Robert, sulkily.

‘No,’ rejoined the bird. ‘The only thing we can do here, it seems, is to
try to frighten our little sisters.’

‘He didn’t, really, and I’m not so VERY little,’ said Jane, rather
ungratefully.

Robert was silent. It was Cyril who suggested that perhaps they had
better take the money and go.

‘That wouldn’t be a kind act, except to ourselves; and it wouldn’t be
good, whatever way you look at it,’ said Anthea, ‘to take money that’s
not ours.’

‘We might take it and spend it all on benefits to the poor and aged,’
said Cyril.

‘That wouldn’t make it right to steal,’ said Anthea, stoutly.

‘I don’t know,’ said Cyril. They were all standing up now. ‘Stealing is
taking things that belong to some one else, and there’s no one else.’

‘It can’t be stealing if--’

‘That’s right,’ said Robert, with ironical approval; ‘stand here all day
arguing while the candles burn out. You’ll like it awfully when it’s all
dark again--and bony.’

‘Let’s get out, then,’ said Anthea. ‘We can argue as we go.’ So they
rolled up the carpet and went. But when they had crept along to the
place where the passage led into the topless tower they found the way
blocked by a great stone, which they could not move.

‘There!’ said Robert. ‘I hope you’re satisfied!’

‘Everything has two ends,’ said the Phoenix, softly; ‘even a quarrel or
a secret passage.’

So they turned round and went back, and Robert was made to go first with
one of the candles, because he was the one who had begun to talk about
bones. And Cyril carried the carpet.

‘I wish you hadn’t put bones into our heads,’ said Jane, as they went
along.

‘I didn’t; you always had them. More bones than brains,’ said Robert.

The passage was long, and there were arches and steps and turnings and
dark alcoves that the girls did not much like passing. The passage ended
in a flight of steps. Robert went up them.

Suddenly he staggered heavily back on to the following feet of Jane, and
everybody screamed, ‘Oh! what is it?’

‘I’ve only bashed my head in,’ said Robert, when he had groaned for some
time; ‘that’s all. Don’t mention it; I like it. The stairs just go right
slap into the ceiling, and it’s a stone ceiling. You can’t do good and
kind actions underneath a paving-stone.’

‘Stairs aren’t made to lead just to paving-stones as a general rule,’
said the Phoenix. ‘Put your shoulder to the wheel.’

‘There isn’t any wheel,’ said the injured Robert, still rubbing his
head.

But Cyril had pushed past him to the top stair, and was already shoving
his hardest against the stone above. Of course, it did not give in the
least.

‘If it’s a trap-door--’ said Cyril. And he stopped shoving and began to
feel about with his hands.

‘Yes, there is a bolt. I can’t move it.’

By a happy chance Cyril had in his pocket the oil-can of his father’s
bicycle; he put the carpet down at the foot of the stairs, and he lay
on his back, with his head on the top step and his feet straggling down
among his young relations, and he oiled the bolt till the drops of rust
and oil fell down on his face. One even went into his mouth--open, as he
panted with the exertion of keeping up this unnatural position. Then
he tried again, but still the bolt would not move. So now he tied his
handkerchief--the one with the bacon-fat and marmalade on it--to the
bolt, and Robert’s handkerchief to that, in a reef knot, which cannot
come undone however much you pull, and, indeed, gets tighter and tighter
the more you pull it. This must not be confused with a granny knot,
which comes undone if you look at it. And then he and Robert pulled,
and the girls put their arms round their brothers and pulled too, and
suddenly the bolt gave way with a rusty scrunch, and they all rolled
together to the bottom of the stairs--all but the Phoenix, which had
taken to its wings when the pulling began.

Nobody was hurt much, because the rolled-up carpet broke their fall; and
now, indeed, the shoulders of the boys were used to some purpose, for
the stone allowed them to heave it up. They felt it give; dust fell
freely on them.

‘Now, then,’ cried Robert, forgetting his head and his temper, ‘push all
together. One, two, three!’

The stone was heaved up. It swung up on a creaking, unwilling hinge, and
showed a growing oblong of dazzling daylight; and it fell back with a
bang against something that kept it upright. Every one climbed out,
but there was not room for every one to stand comfortably in the
little paved house where they found themselves, so when the Phoenix had
fluttered up from the darkness they let the stone down, and it closed
like a trap-door, as indeed it was.

You can have no idea how dusty and dirty the children were. Fortunately
there was no one to see them but each other. The place they were in
was a little shrine, built on the side of a road that went winding up
through yellow-green fields to the topless tower. Below them were fields
and orchards, all bare boughs and brown furrows, and little houses and
gardens. The shrine was a kind of tiny chapel with no front wall--just a
place for people to stop and rest in and wish to be good. So the Phoenix
told them. There was an image that had once been brightly coloured, but
the rain and snow had beaten in through the open front of the shrine,
and the poor image was dull and weather-stained. Under it was written:
‘St Jean de Luz. Priez pour nous.’ It was a sad little place, very
neglected and lonely, and yet it was nice, Anthea thought, that poor
travellers should come to this little rest-house in the hurry and worry
of their journeyings and be quiet for a few minutes, and think about
being good. The thought of St Jean de Luz--who had, no doubt, in his
time, been very good and kind--made Anthea want more than ever to do
something kind and good.

‘Tell us,’ she said to the Phoenix, ‘what is the good and kind action
the carpet brought us here to do?’

‘I think it would be kind to find the owners of the treasure and tell
them about it,’ said Cyril.

‘And give it them ALL?’ said Jane.

‘Yes. But whose is it?’

‘I should go to the first house and ask the name of the owner of the
castle,’ said the golden bird, and really the idea seemed a good one.

They dusted each other as well as they could and went down the road. A
little way on they found a tiny spring, bubbling out of the hillside and
falling into a rough stone basin surrounded by draggled hart’s-tongue
ferns, now hardly green at all. Here the children washed their hands
and faces and dried them on their pocket-handkerchiefs, which always,
on these occasions, seem unnaturally small. Cyril’s and Robert’s
handkerchiefs, indeed, rather undid the effects of the wash. But in
spite of this the party certainly looked cleaner than before.

The first house they came to was a little white house with green
shutters and a slate roof. It stood in a prim little garden, and down
each side of the neat path were large stone vases for flowers to grow
in; but all the flowers were dead now.

Along one side of the house was a sort of wide veranda, built of poles
and trellis-work, and a vine crawled all over it. It was wider than our
English verandas, and Anthea thought it must look lovely when the
green leaves and the grapes were there; but now there were only dry,
reddish-brown stalks and stems, with a few withered leaves caught in
them.

The children walked up to the front door. It was green and narrow. A
chain with a handle hung beside it, and joined itself quite openly to a
rusty bell that hung under the porch. Cyril had pulled the bell and
its noisy clang was dying away before the terrible thought came to all.
Cyril spoke it.

‘My hat!’ he breathed. ‘We don’t know any French!’

At this moment the door opened. A very tall, lean lady, with pale
ringlets like whitey-brown paper or oak shavings, stood before them. She
had an ugly grey dress and a black silk apron. Her eyes were small
and grey and not pretty, and the rims were red, as though she had been
crying.

She addressed the party in something that sounded like a foreign
language, and ended with something which they were sure was a question.
Of course, no one could answer it.

‘What does she say?’ Robert asked, looking down into the hollow of his
jacket, where the Phoenix was nestling. But before the Phoenix could
answer, the whitey-brown lady’s face was lighted up by a most charming
smile.

‘You--you ar-r-re fr-r-rom the England!’ she cried. ‘I love so much
the England. Mais entrez--entrez donc tous! Enter, then--enter all. One
essuyes his feet on the carpet.’ She pointed to the mat.

‘We only wanted to ask--’

‘I shall say you all that what you wish,’ said the lady. ‘Enter only!’

So they all went in, wiping their feet on a very clean mat, and putting
the carpet in a safe corner of the veranda.

‘The most beautiful days of my life,’ said the lady, as she shut the
door, ‘did pass themselves in England. And since long time I have not
heard an English voice to repeal me the past.’

This warm welcome embarrassed every one, but most the boys, for the
floor of the hall was of such very clean red and white tiles, and
the floor of the sitting-room so very shiny--like a black
looking-glass--that each felt as though he had on far more boots than
usual, and far noisier.

There was a wood fire, very small and very bright, on the hearth--neat
little logs laid on brass fire-dogs. Some portraits of powdered ladies
and gentlemen hung in oval frames on the pale walls. There were silver
candlesticks on the mantelpiece, and there were chairs and a table, very
slim and polite, with slender legs. The room was extremely bare, but
with a bright foreign bareness that was very cheerful, in an odd way of
its own. At the end of the polished table a very un-English little boy
sat on a footstool in a high-backed, uncomfortable-looking chair. He
wore black velvet, and the kind of collar--all frills and lacey--that
Robert would rather have died than wear; but then the little French boy
was much younger than Robert.

‘Oh, how pretty!’ said every one. But no one meant the little French
boy, with the velvety short knickerbockers and the velvety short hair.

What every one admired was a little, little Christmas-tree, very green,
and standing in a very red little flower-pot, and hung round with very
bright little things made of tinsel and coloured paper. There were tiny
candles on the tree, but they were not lighted yet.

‘But yes--is it not that it is genteel?’ said the lady. ‘Sit down you
then, and let us see.’

The children sat down in a row on the stiff chairs against the wall, and
the lady lighted a long, slim red taper at the wood flame, and then she
drew the curtains and lit the little candles, and when they were all
lighted the little French boy suddenly shouted, ‘Bravo, ma tante! Oh,
que c’est gentil,’ and the English children shouted ‘Hooray!’

Then there was a struggle in the breast of Robert, and out fluttered the
Phoenix--spread his gold wings, flew to the top of the Christmas-tree,
and perched there.

‘Ah! catch it, then,’ cried the lady; ‘it will itself burn--your genteel
parrakeet!’

‘It won’t,’ said Robert, ‘thank you.’

And the little French boy clapped his clean and tidy hands; but the lady
was so anxious that the Phoenix fluttered down and walked up and down on
the shiny walnut-wood table.

‘Is it that it talks?’ asked the lady.

And the Phoenix replied in excellent French. It said, ‘Parfaitement,
madame!’

‘Oh, the pretty parrakeet,’ said the lady. ‘Can it say still of other
things?’

And the Phoenix replied, this time in English, ‘Why are you sad so near
Christmas-time?’

The children looked at it with one gasp of horror and surprise, for
the youngest of them knew that it is far from manners to notice that
strangers have been crying, and much worse to ask them the reason of
their tears. And, of course, the lady began to cry again, very much
indeed, after calling the Phoenix a bird without a heart; and she could
not find her handkerchief, so Anthea offered hers, which was still very
damp and no use at all. She also hugged the lady, and this seemed to be
of more use than the handkerchief, so that presently the lady stopped
crying, and found her own handkerchief and dried her eyes, and called
Anthea a cherished angel.

‘I am sorry we came just when you were so sad,’ said Anthea, ‘but we
really only wanted to ask you whose that castle is on the hill.’

‘Oh, my little angel,’ said the poor lady, sniffing, ‘to-day and for
hundreds of years the castle is to us, to our family. To-morrow it must
that I sell it to some strangers--and my little Henri, who ignores
all, he will not have never the lands paternal. But what will you? His
father, my brother--Mr the Marquis--has spent much of money, and it the
must, despite the sentiments of familial respect, that I admit that my
sainted father he also--’

‘How would you feel if you found a lot of money--hundreds and thousands
of gold pieces?’ asked Cyril.

The lady smiled sadly.

‘Ah! one has already recounted to you the legend?’ she said. ‘It is
true that one says that it is long time; oh! but long time, one of our
ancestors has hid a treasure--of gold, and of gold, and of gold--enough
to enrich my little Henri for the life. But all that, my children, it is
but the accounts of fays--’

‘She means fairy stories,’ whispered the Phoenix to Robert. ‘Tell her
what you have found.’

So Robert told, while Anthea and Jane hugged the lady for fear she
should faint for joy, like people in books, and they hugged her with the
earnest, joyous hugs of unselfish delight.

‘It’s no use explaining how we got in,’ said Robert, when he had told
of the finding of the treasure, ‘because you would find it a little
difficult to understand, and much more difficult to believe. But we can
show you where the gold is and help you to fetch it away.’

The lady looked doubtfully at Robert as she absently returned the hugs
of the girls.

‘No, he’s not making it up,’ said Anthea; ‘it’s true, TRUE, TRUE!--and
we are so glad.’

‘You would not be capable to torment an old woman?’ she said; ‘and it is
not possible that it be a dream.’

‘It really IS true,’ said Cyril; ‘and I congratulate you very much.’

His tone of studied politeness seemed to convince more than the raptures
of the others.

‘If I do not dream,’ she said, ‘Henri come to Manon--and you--you shall
come all with me to Mr the Curate. Is it not?’

Manon was a wrinkled old woman with a red and yellow handkerchief
twisted round her head. She took Henri, who was already sleepy with the
excitement of his Christmas-tree and his visitors, and when the lady had
put on a stiff black cape and a wonderful black silk bonnet and a pair
of black wooden clogs over her black cashmere house-boots, the whole
party went down the road to a little white house--very like the one they
had left--where an old priest, with a good face, welcomed them with a
politeness so great that it hid his astonishment.

The lady, with her French waving hands and her shrugging French
shoulders and her trembling French speech, told the story. And now the
priest, who knew no English, shrugged HIS shoulders and waved HIS hands
and spoke also in French.

‘He thinks,’ whispered the Phoenix, ‘that her troubles have turned her
brain. What a pity you know no French!’

‘I do know a lot of French,’ whispered Robert, indignantly; ‘but it’s
all about the pencil of the gardener’s son and the penknife of the
baker’s niece--nothing that anyone ever wants to say.’

‘If _I_ speak,’ the bird whispered, ‘he’ll think HE’S mad, too.’

‘Tell me what to say.’

‘Say “C’est vrai, monsieur. Venez donc voir,”’ said the Phoenix; and
then Robert earned the undying respect of everybody by suddenly saying,
very loudly and distinctly--

‘Say vray, mossoo; venny dong vwaw.’

The priest was disappointed when he found that Robert’s French began and
ended with these useful words; but, at any rate, he saw that if the lady
was mad she was not the only one, and he put on a big beavery hat, and
got a candle and matches and a spade, and they all went up the hill to
the wayside shrine of St John of Luz.

‘Now,’ said Robert, ‘I will go first and show you where it is.’

So they prised the stone up with a corner of the spade, and Robert did
go first, and they all followed and found the golden treasure exactly as
they had left it. And every one was flushed with the joy of performing
such a wonderfully kind action.

Then the lady and the priest clasped hands and wept for joy, as French
people do, and knelt down and touched the money, and talked very fast
and both together, and the lady embraced all the children three times
each, and called them ‘little garden angels,’ and then she and the
priest shook each other by both hands again, and talked, and talked, and
talked, faster and more Frenchy than you would have believed possible.
And the children were struck dumb with joy and pleasure.

‘Get away NOW,’ said the Phoenix softly, breaking in on the radiant
dream.

So the children crept away, and out through the little shrine, and the
lady and the priest were so tearfully, talkatively happy that they never
noticed that the guardian angels had gone.

The ‘garden angels’ ran down the hill to the lady’s little house, where
they had left the carpet on the veranda, and they spread it out and
said ‘Home,’ and no one saw them disappear, except little Henri, who
had flattened his nose into a white button against the window-glass, and
when he tried to tell his aunt she thought he had been dreaming. So that
was all right.

‘It is much the best thing we’ve done,’ said Anthea, when they talked
it over at tea-time. ‘In the future we’ll only do kind actions with the
carpet.’

‘Ahem!’ said the Phoenix.

‘I beg your pardon?’ said Anthea.

‘Oh, nothing,’ said the bird. ‘I was only thinking!’



CHAPTER 7. MEWS FROM PERSIA


When you hear that the four children found themselves at Waterloo
Station quite un-taken-care-of, and with no one to meet them, it may
make you think that their parents were neither kind nor careful. But if
you think this you will be wrong. The fact is, mother arranged with Aunt
Emma that she was to meet the children at Waterloo, when they went back
from their Christmas holiday at Lyndhurst. The train was fixed, but not
the day. Then mother wrote to Aunt Emma, giving her careful instructions
about the day and the hour, and about luggage and cabs and things, and
gave the letter to Robert to post. But the hounds happened to meet near
Rufus Stone that morning, and what is more, on the way to the meet they
met Robert, and Robert met them, and instantly forgot all about posting
Aunt Emma’s letter, and never thought of it again until he and
the others had wandered three times up and down the platform at
Waterloo--which makes six in all--and had bumped against old gentlemen,
and stared in the faces of ladies, and been shoved by people in a hurry,
and ‘by-your-leaved’ by porters with trucks, and were quite, quite sure
that Aunt Emma was not there. Then suddenly the true truth of what he
had forgotten to do came home to Robert, and he said, ‘Oh, crikey!’ and
stood still with his mouth open, and let a porter with a Gladstone bag
in each hand and a bundle of umbrellas under one arm blunder heavily
into him, and never so much as said, ‘Where are you shoving to now?’ or,
‘Look out where you’re going, can’t you?’ The heavier bag smote him at
the knee, and he staggered, but he said nothing.

When the others understood what was the matter I think they told Robert
what they thought of him.

‘We must take the train to Croydon,’ said Anthea, ‘and find Aunt Emma.’

‘Yes,’ said Cyril, ‘and precious pleased those Jevonses would be to see
us and our traps.’

Aunt Emma, indeed, was staying with some Jevonses--very prim people.
They were middle-aged and wore very smart blouses, and they were fond of
matinees and shopping, and they did not care about children.

‘I know MOTHER would be pleased to see us if we went back,’ said Jane.

‘Yes, she would, but she’d think it was not right to show she was
pleased, because it’s Bob’s fault we’re not met. Don’t I know the sort
of thing?’ said Cyril. ‘Besides, we’ve no tin. No; we’ve got enough for
a growler among us, but not enough for tickets to the New Forest. We
must just go home. They won’t be so savage when they find we’ve really
got home all right. You know auntie was only going to take us home in a
cab.’

‘I believe we ought to go to Croydon,’ Anthea insisted.

‘Aunt Emma would be out to a dead cert,’ said Robert. ‘Those Jevonses go
to the theatre every afternoon, I believe. Besides, there’s the Phoenix
at home, AND the carpet. I votes we call a four-wheeled cabman.’

A four-wheeled cabman was called--his cab was one of the old-fashioned
kind with straw in the bottom--and he was asked by Anthea to drive them
very carefully to their address. This he did, and the price he asked
for doing so was exactly the value of the gold coin grandpapa had given
Cyril for Christmas. This cast a gloom; but Cyril would never have
stooped to argue about a cab-fare, for fear the cabman should think he
was not accustomed to take cabs whenever he wanted them. For a reason
that was something like this he told the cabman to put the luggage
on the steps, and waited till the wheels of the growler had grittily
retired before he rang the bell.

‘You see,’ he said, with his hand on the handle, ‘we don’t want cook
and Eliza asking us before HIM how it is we’ve come home alone, as if we
were babies.’

Here he rang the bell; and the moment its answering clang was heard,
every one felt that it would be some time before that bell was answered.
The sound of a bell is quite different, somehow, when there is anyone
inside the house who hears it. I can’t tell you why that is--but so it
is.

‘I expect they’re changing their dresses,’ said Jane.

‘Too late,’ said Anthea, ‘it must be past five. I expect Eliza’s gone to
post a letter, and cook’s gone to see the time.’

Cyril rang again. And the bell did its best to inform the listening
children that there was really no one human in the house. They rang
again and listened intently. The hearts of all sank low. It is a
terrible thing to be locked out of your own house, on a dark, muggy
January evening.

‘There is no gas on anywhere,’ said Jane, in a broken voice.

‘I expect they’ve left the gas on once too often, and the draught blew
it out, and they’re suffocated in their beds. Father always said they
would some day,’ said Robert cheerfully.

‘Let’s go and fetch a policeman,’ said Anthea, trembling.

‘And be taken up for trying to be burglars--no, thank you,’ said Cyril.
‘I heard father read out of the paper about a young man who got into his
own mother’s house, and they got him made a burglar only the other day.’

‘I only hope the gas hasn’t hurt the Phoenix,’ said Anthea. ‘It said it
wanted to stay in the bathroom cupboard, and I thought it would be all
right, because the servants never clean that out. But if it’s gone and
got out and been choked by gas--And besides, directly we open the door
we shall be choked, too. I KNEW we ought to have gone to Aunt Emma, at
Croydon. Oh, Squirrel, I wish we had. Let’s go NOW.’

‘Shut up,’ said her brother, briefly. ‘There’s some one rattling the
latch inside.’ Every one listened with all its ears, and every one stood
back as far from the door as the steps would allow.

The latch rattled, and clicked. Then the flap of the letter-box lifted
itself--every one saw it by the flickering light of the gas-lamp that
shone through the leafless lime-tree by the gate--a golden eye seemed to
wink at them through the letter-slit, and a cautious beak whispered--

‘Are you alone?’

‘It’s the Phoenix,’ said every one, in a voice so joyous, and so full of
relief, as to be a sort of whispered shout.

‘Hush!’ said the voice from the letter-box slit. ‘Your slaves have gone
a-merry-making. The latch of this portal is too stiff for my beak.
But at the side--the little window above the shelf whereon your bread
lies--it is not fastened.’

‘Righto!’ said Cyril.

And Anthea added, ‘I wish you’d meet us there, dear Phoenix.’

The children crept round to the pantry window. It is at the side of the
house, and there is a green gate labelled ‘Tradesmen’s Entrance’, which
is always kept bolted. But if you get one foot on the fence between you
and next door, and one on the handle of the gate, you are over before
you know where you are. This, at least, was the experience of Cyril and
Robert, and even, if the truth must be told, of Anthea and Jane. So in
almost no time all four were in the narrow gravelled passage that runs
between that house and the next.

Then Robert made a back, and Cyril hoisted himself up and got his
knicker-bockered knee on the concrete window-sill. He dived into the
pantry head first, as one dives into water, and his legs waved in the
air as he went, just as your legs do when you are first beginning
to learn to dive. The soles of his boots--squarish muddy
patches--disappeared.

‘Give me a leg up,’ said Robert to his sisters.

‘No, you don’t,’ said Jane firmly. ‘I’m not going to be left outside
here with just Anthea, and have something creep up behind us out of the
dark. Squirrel can go and open the back door.’

A light had sprung awake in the pantry. Cyril always said the Phoenix
turned the gas on with its beak, and lighted it with a waft of its wing;
but he was excited at the time, and perhaps he really did it himself
with matches, and then forgot all about it. He let the others in by the
back door. And when it had been bolted again the children went all over
the house and lighted every single gas-jet they could find. For they
couldn’t help feeling that this was just the dark dreary winter’s
evening when an armed burglar might easily be expected to appear at any
moment. There is nothing like light when you are afraid of burglars--or
of anything else, for that matter.

And when all the gas-jets were lighted it was quite clear that the
Phoenix had made no mistake, and that Eliza and cook were really out,
and that there was no one in the house except the four children, and the
Phoenix, and the carpet, and the blackbeetles who lived in the cupboards
on each side of the nursery fire-place. These last were very pleased
that the children had come home again, especially when Anthea had
lighted the nursery fire. But, as usual, the children treated the loving
little blackbeetles with coldness and disdain.

I wonder whether you know how to light a fire? I don’t mean how to
strike a match and set fire to the corners of the paper in a fire
someone has laid ready, but how to lay and light a fire all by yourself.
I will tell you how Anthea did it, and if ever you have to light one
yourself you may remember how it is done. First, she raked out the ashes
of the fire that had burned there a week ago--for Eliza had actually
never done this, though she had had plenty of time. In doing this Anthea
knocked her knuckle and made it bleed. Then she laid the largest and
handsomest cinders in the bottom of the grate. Then she took a sheet
of old newspaper (you ought never to light a fire with to-day’s
newspaper--it will not burn well, and there are other reasons against
it), and tore it into four quarters, and screwed each of these into a
loose ball, and put them on the cinders; then she got a bundle of wood
and broke the string, and stuck the sticks in so that their front ends
rested on the bars, and the back ends on the back of the paper balls.
In doing this she cut her finger slightly with the string, and when she
broke it, two of the sticks jumped up and hit her on the cheek. Then she
put more cinders and some bits of coal--no dust. She put most of that
on her hands, but there seemed to be enough left for her face. Then
she lighted the edges of the paper balls, and waited till she heard the
fizz-crack-crack-fizz of the wood as it began to burn. Then she went and
washed her hands and face under the tap in the back kitchen.

Of course, you need not bark your knuckles, or cut your finger, or
bruise your cheek with wood, or black yourself all over; but otherwise,
this is a very good way to light a fire in London. In the real country
fires are lighted in a different and prettier way.

But it is always good to wash your hands and face afterwards, wherever
you are.

While Anthea was delighting the poor little blackbeetles with the
cheerful blaze, Jane had set the table for--I was going to say tea, but
the meal of which I am speaking was not exactly tea. Let us call it a
tea-ish meal. There was tea, certainly, for Anthea’s fire blazed and
crackled so kindly that it really seemed to be affectionately inviting
the kettle to come and sit upon its lap. So the kettle was brought and
tea made. But no milk could be found--so every one had six lumps of
sugar to each cup instead. The things to eat, on the other hand, were
nicer than usual. The boys looked about very carefully, and found in
the pantry some cold tongue, bread, butter, cheese, and part of a cold
pudding--very much nicer than cook ever made when they were at home. And
in the kitchen cupboard was half a Christmassy cake, a pot of strawberry
jam, and about a pound of mixed candied fruit, with soft crumbly slabs
of delicious sugar in each cup of lemon, orange, or citron.

It was indeed, as Jane said, ‘a banquet fit for an Arabian Knight.’

The Phoenix perched on Robert’s chair, and listened kindly and
politely to all they had to tell it about their visit to Lyndhurst,
and underneath the table, by just stretching a toe down rather far, the
faithful carpet could be felt by all--even by Jane, whose legs were very
short.

‘Your slaves will not return to-night,’ said the Phoenix. ‘They sleep
under the roof of the cook’s stepmother’s aunt, who is, I gather,
hostess to a large party to-night in honour of her husband’s cousin’s
sister-in-law’s mother’s ninetieth birthday.’

‘I don’t think they ought to have gone without leave,’ said Anthea,
‘however many relations they have, or however old they are; but I
suppose we ought to wash up.’

‘It’s not our business about the leave,’ said Cyril, firmly, ‘but I
simply won’t wash up for them. We got it, and we’ll clear it away; and
then we’ll go somewhere on the carpet. It’s not often we get a chance
of being out all night. We can go right away to the other side of the
equator, to the tropical climes, and see the sun rise over the great
Pacific Ocean.’

‘Right you are,’ said Robert. ‘I always did want to see the Southern
Cross and the stars as big as gas-lamps.’

‘DON’T go,’ said Anthea, very earnestly, ‘because I COULDN’T. I’m SURE
mother wouldn’t like us to leave the house and I should hate to be left
here alone.’

‘I’d stay with you,’ said Jane loyally.

‘I know you would,’ said Anthea gratefully, ‘but even with you I’d much
rather not.’

‘Well,’ said Cyril, trying to be kind and amiable, ‘I don’t want you to
do anything you think’s wrong, BUT--’

He was silent; this silence said many things.

‘I don’t see,’ Robert was beginning, when Anthea interrupted--

‘I’m quite sure. Sometimes you just think a thing’s wrong, and sometimes
you KNOW. And this is a KNOW time.’

The Phoenix turned kind golden eyes on her and opened a friendly beak to
say--

‘When it is, as you say, a “know time”, there is no more to be said. And
your noble brothers would never leave you.’

‘Of course not,’ said Cyril rather quickly. And Robert said so too.

‘I myself,’ the Phoenix went on, ‘am willing to help in any way
possible. I will go personally--either by carpet or on the wing--and
fetch you anything you can think of to amuse you during the evening. In
order to waste no time I could go while you wash up.--Why,’ it went on
in a musing voice, ‘does one wash up teacups and wash down the stairs?’

‘You couldn’t wash stairs up, you know,’ said Anthea, ‘unless you began
at the bottom and went up feet first as you washed. I wish cook would
try that way for a change.’

‘I don’t,’ said Cyril, briefly. ‘I should hate the look of her
elastic-side boots sticking up.’

‘This is mere trifling,’ said the Phoenix. ‘Come, decide what I shall
fetch for you. I can get you anything you like.’

But of course they couldn’t decide. Many things were suggested--a
rocking-horse, jewelled chessmen, an elephant, a bicycle, a motor-car,
books with pictures, musical instruments, and many other things. But
a musical instrument is agreeable only to the player, unless he has
learned to play it really well; books are not sociable, bicycles cannot
be ridden without going out of doors, and the same is true of motor-cars
and elephants. Only two people can play chess at once with one set of
chessmen (and anyway it’s very much too much like lessons for a game),
and only one can ride on a rocking-horse. Suddenly, in the midst of the
discussion, the Phoenix spread its wings and fluttered to the floor, and
from there it spoke.

‘I gather,’ it said, ‘from the carpet, that it wants you to let it go
to its old home, where it was born and brought up, and it will return
within the hour laden with a number of the most beautiful and delightful
products of its native land.’

‘What IS its native land?’

‘I didn’t gather. But since you can’t agree, and time is passing, and
the tea-things are not washed down--I mean washed up--’

‘I votes we do,’ said Robert. ‘It’ll stop all this jaw, anyway. And it’s
not bad to have surprises. Perhaps it’s a Turkey carpet, and it might
bring us Turkish delight.’

‘Or a Turkish patrol,’ said Robert.

‘Or a Turkish bath,’ said Anthea.

‘Or a Turkish towel,’ said Jane.

‘Nonsense,’ Robert urged, ‘it said beautiful and delightful, and towels
and baths aren’t THAT, however good they may be for you. Let it go. I
suppose it won’t give us the slip,’ he added, pushing back his chair and
standing up.

‘Hush!’ said the Phoenix; ‘how can you? Don’t trample on its feelings
just because it’s only a carpet.’

‘But how can it do it--unless one of us is on it to do the wishing?’
asked Robert. He spoke with a rising hope that it MIGHT be necessary for
one to go and why not Robert? But the Phoenix quickly threw cold water
on his new-born dream.

‘Why, you just write your wish on a paper, and pin it on the carpet.’

So a leaf was torn from Anthea’s arithmetic book, and on it Cyril wrote
in large round-hand the following:


We wish you to go to your dear native home, and bring back the most
beautiful and delightful productions of it you can--and not to be gone
long, please.

                    (Signed)  CYRIL.
                              ROBERT.
                              ANTHEA.
                              JANE.


Then the paper was laid on the carpet.

‘Writing down, please,’ said the Phoenix; ‘the carpet can’t read a paper
whose back is turned to it, any more than you can.’

It was pinned fast, and the table and chairs having been moved, the
carpet simply and suddenly vanished, rather like a patch of water on a
hearth under a fierce fire. The edges got smaller and smaller, and then
it disappeared from sight.

‘It may take it some time to collect the beautiful and delightful
things,’ said the Phoenix. ‘I should wash up--I mean wash down.’

So they did. There was plenty of hot water left in the kettle, and every
one helped--even the Phoenix, who took up cups by their handles with its
clever claws and dipped them in the hot water, and then stood them on
the table ready for Anthea to dry them. But the bird was rather slow,
because, as it said, though it was not above any sort of honest work,
messing about with dish-water was not exactly what it had been brought
up to. Everything was nicely washed up, and dried, and put in its proper
place, and the dish-cloth washed and hung on the edge of the copper
to dry, and the tea-cloth was hung on the line that goes across the
scullery. (If you are a duchess’s child, or a king’s, or a person of
high social position’s child, you will perhaps not know the difference
between a dish-cloth and a tea-cloth; but in that case your nurse has
been better instructed than you, and she will tell you all about it.)
And just as eight hands and one pair of claws were being dried on the
roller-towel behind the scullery door there came a strange sound from
the other side of the kitchen wall--the side where the nursery was. It
was a very strange sound, indeed--most odd, and unlike any other sounds
the children had ever heard. At least, they had heard sounds as much
like it as a toy engine’s whistle is like a steam siren’s.

‘The carpet’s come back,’ said Robert; and the others felt that he was
right.

‘But what has it brought with it?’ asked Jane. ‘It sounds like
Leviathan, that great beast.’

‘It couldn’t have been made in India, and have brought elephants? Even
baby ones would be rather awful in that room,’ said Cyril. ‘I vote we
take it in turns to squint through the keyhole.’

They did--in the order of their ages. The Phoenix, being the eldest by
some thousands of years, was entitled to the first peep. But--

‘Excuse me,’ it said, ruffling its golden feathers and sneezing softly;
‘looking through keyholes always gives me a cold in my golden eyes.’

So Cyril looked.

‘I see something grey moving,’ said he.

‘It’s a zoological garden of some sort, I bet,’ said Robert, when he had
taken his turn. And the soft rustling, bustling, ruffling, scuffling,
shuffling, fluffling noise went on inside.

‘_I_ can’t see anything,’ said Anthea, ‘my eye tickles so.’

Then Jane’s turn came, and she put her eye to the keyhole.

‘It’s a giant kitty-cat,’ she said; ‘and it’s asleep all over the
floor.’

‘Giant cats are tigers--father said so.’

‘No, he didn’t. He said tigers were giant cats. It’s not at all the same
thing.’

‘It’s no use sending the carpet to fetch precious things for you
if you’re afraid to look at them when they come,’ said the Phoenix,
sensibly. And Cyril, being the eldest, said--

‘Come on,’ and turned the handle.

The gas had been left full on after tea, and everything in the room
could be plainly seen by the ten eyes at the door. At least, not
everything, for though the carpet was there it was invisible, because it
was completely covered by the hundred and ninety-nine beautiful objects
which it had brought from its birthplace.

‘My hat!’ Cyril remarked. ‘I never thought about its being a PERSIAN
carpet.’

Yet it was now plain that it was so, for the beautiful objects which it
had brought back were cats--Persian cats, grey Persian cats, and there
were, as I have said, 199 of them, and they were sitting on the carpet
as close as they could get to each other. But the moment the children
entered the room the cats rose and stretched, and spread and overflowed
from the carpet to the floor, and in an instant the floor was a sea of
moving, mewing pussishness, and the children with one accord climbed to
the table, and gathered up their legs, and the people next door knocked
on the wall--and, indeed, no wonder, for the mews were Persian and
piercing.

‘This is pretty poor sport,’ said Cyril. ‘What’s the matter with the
bounders?’

‘I imagine that they are hungry,’ said the Phoenix. ‘If you were to feed
them--’

‘We haven’t anything to feed them with,’ said Anthea in despair, and she
stroked the nearest Persian back. ‘Oh, pussies, do be quiet--we can’t
hear ourselves think.’

She had to shout this entreaty, for the mews were growing deafening,
‘and it would take pounds’ and pounds’ worth of cat’s-meat.’

‘Let’s ask the carpet to take them away,’ said Robert. But the girls
said ‘No.’

‘They are so soft and pussy,’ said Jane.

‘And valuable,’ said Anthea, hastily. ‘We can sell them for lots and
lots of money.’

‘Why not send the carpet to get food for them?’ suggested the Phoenix,
and its golden voice came harsh and cracked with the effort it had to be
make to be heard above the increasing fierceness of the Persian mews.

So it was written that the carpet should bring food for 199 Persian
cats, and the paper was pinned to the carpet as before.

The carpet seemed to gather itself together, and the cats dropped off
it, as raindrops do from your mackintosh when you shake it. And the
carpet disappeared.

Unless you have had one-hundred and ninety-nine well-grown Persian cats
in one small room, all hungry, and all saying so in unmistakable mews,
you can form but a poor idea of the noise that now deafened the children
and the Phoenix. The cats did not seem to have been at all properly
brought up. They seemed to have no idea of its being a mistake in
manners to ask for meals in a strange house--let alone to howl for
them--and they mewed, and they mewed, and they mewed, and they mewed,
till the children poked their fingers into their ears and waited in
silent agony, wondering why the whole of Camden Town did not come
knocking at the door to ask what was the matter, and only hoping that
the food for the cats would come before the neighbours did--and before
all the secret of the carpet and the Phoenix had to be given away beyond
recall to an indignant neighbourhood.

The cats mewed and mewed and twisted their Persian forms in and out and
unfolded their Persian tails, and the children and the Phoenix huddled
together on the table.

The Phoenix, Robert noticed suddenly, was trembling.

‘So many cats,’ it said, ‘and they might not know I was the Phoenix.
These accidents happen so quickly. It quite un-mans me.’

This was a danger of which the children had not thought.

‘Creep in,’ cried Robert, opening his jacket.

And the Phoenix crept in--only just in time, for green eyes had glared,
pink noses had sniffed, white whiskers had twitched, and as Robert
buttoned his coat he disappeared to the waist in a wave of eager grey
Persian fur. And on the instant the good carpet slapped itself down on
the floor. And it was covered with rats--three hundred and ninety-eight
of them, I believe, two for each cat.

‘How horrible!’ cried Anthea. ‘Oh, take them away!’

‘Take yourself away,’ said the Phoenix, ‘and me.’

‘I wish we’d never had a carpet,’ said Anthea, in tears.

They hustled and crowded out of the door, and shut it, and locked it.
Cyril, with great presence of mind, lit a candle and turned off the gas
at the main.

‘The rats’ll have a better chance in the dark,’ he said.

The mewing had ceased. Every one listened in breathless silence. We all
know that cats eat rats--it is one of the first things we read in our
little brown reading books; but all those cats eating all those rats--it
wouldn’t bear thinking of.

Suddenly Robert sniffed, in the silence of the dark kitchen, where the
only candle was burning all on one side, because of the draught.

‘What a funny scent!’ he said.

And as he spoke, a lantern flashed its light through the window of the
kitchen, a face peered in, and a voice said--

‘What’s all this row about? You let me in.’

It was the voice of the police!

Robert tip-toed to the window, and spoke through the pane that had
been a little cracked since Cyril accidentally knocked it with a
walking-stick when he was playing at balancing it on his nose. (It was
after they had been to a circus.)

‘What do you mean?’ he said. ‘There’s no row. You listen; everything’s
as quiet as quiet.’ And indeed it was.

The strange sweet scent grew stronger, and the Phoenix put out its beak.

The policeman hesitated.

‘They’re MUSK-rats,’ said the Phoenix. ‘I suppose some cats eat
them--but never Persian ones. What a mistake for a well-informed carpet
to make! Oh, what a night we’re having!’

‘Do go away,’ said Robert, nervously. ‘We’re just going to bed--that’s
our bedroom candle; there isn’t any row. Everything’s as quiet as a
mouse.’

A wild chorus of mews drowned his words, and with the mews were mingled
the shrieks of the musk-rats. What had happened? Had the cats tasted
them before deciding that they disliked the flavour?

‘I’m a-coming in,’ said the policeman. ‘You’ve got a cat shut up there.’

‘A cat,’ said Cyril. ‘Oh, my only aunt! A cat!’

‘Come in, then,’ said Robert. ‘It’s your own look out. I advise you not.
Wait a shake, and I’ll undo the side gate.’

He undid the side gate, and the policeman, very cautiously, came in. And
there in the kitchen, by the light of one candle, with the mewing
and the screaming going like a dozen steam sirens, twenty waiting on
motor-cars, and half a hundred squeaking pumps, four agitated voices
shouted to the policeman four mixed and wholly different explanations of
the very mixed events of the evening.

Did you ever try to explain the simplest thing to a policeman?



CHAPTER 8. THE CATS, THE COW, AND THE BURGLAR

The nursery was full of Persian cats and musk-rats that had been brought
there by the wishing carpet. The cats were mewing and the musk-rats were
squeaking so that you could hardly hear yourself speak. In the kitchen
were the four children, one candle, a concealed Phoenix, and a very
visible policeman.

‘Now then, look here,’ said the Policeman, very loudly, and he pointed
his lantern at each child in turn, ‘what’s the meaning of this here
yelling and caterwauling. I tell you you’ve got a cat here, and some
one’s a ill-treating of it. What do you mean by it, eh?’

It was five to one, counting the Phoenix; but the policeman, who was
one, was of unusually fine size, and the five, including the Phoenix,
were small. The mews and the squeaks grew softer, and in the comparative
silence, Cyril said--

‘It’s true. There are a few cats here. But we’ve not hurt them. It’s
quite the opposite. We’ve just fed them.’

‘It don’t sound like it,’ said the policeman grimly.

‘I daresay they’re not REAL cats,’ said Jane madly, perhaps they’re only
dream-cats.’

‘I’ll dream-cat you, my lady,’ was the brief response of the force.

‘If you understood anything except people who do murders and stealings
and naughty things like that, I’d tell you all about it,’ said Robert;
‘but I’m certain you don’t. You’re not meant to shove your oar into
people’s private cat-keepings. You’re only supposed to interfere when
people shout “murder” and “stop thief” in the street. So there!’

The policeman assured them that he should see about that; and at this
point the Phoenix, who had been making itself small on the pot-shelf
under the dresser, among the saucepan lids and the fish-kettle, walked
on tip-toed claws in a noiseless and modest manner, and left the room
unnoticed by any one.

‘Oh, don’t be so horrid,’ Anthea was saying, gently and earnestly. ‘We
LOVE cats--dear pussy-soft things. We wouldn’t hurt them for worlds.
Would we, Pussy?’

And Jane answered that of course they wouldn’t. And still the policeman
seemed unmoved by their eloquence.

‘Now, look here,’ he said, ‘I’m a-going to see what’s in that room
beyond there, and--’

His voice was drowned in a wild burst of mewing and squeaking. And as
soon as it died down all four children began to explain at once; and
though the squeaking and mewing were not at their very loudest, yet
there was quite enough of both to make it very hard for the policeman
to understand a single word of any of the four wholly different
explanations now poured out to him.

‘Stow it,’ he said at last. ‘I’m a-goin’ into the next room in the
execution of my duty. I’m a-goin’ to use my eyes--my ears have gone off
their chumps, what with you and them cats.’

And he pushed Robert aside, and strode through the door.

‘Don’t say I didn’t warn you,’ said Robert.

‘It’s tigers REALLY,’ said Jane. ‘Father said so. I wouldn’t go in, if I
were you.’

But the policeman was quite stony; nothing any one said seemed to make
any difference to him. Some policemen are like this, I believe. He
strode down the passage, and in another moment he would have been in the
room with all the cats and all the rats (musk), but at that very instant
a thin, sharp voice screamed from the street outside--

‘Murder--murder! Stop thief!’

The policeman stopped, with one regulation boot heavily poised in the
air.

‘Eh?’ he said.

And again the shrieks sounded shrilly and piercingly from the dark
street outside.

‘Come on,’ said Robert. ‘Come and look after cats while somebody’s being
killed outside.’ For Robert had an inside feeling that told him quite
plainly WHO it was that was screaming.

‘You young rip,’ said the policeman, ‘I’ll settle up with you bimeby.’

And he rushed out, and the children heard his boots going weightily
along the pavement, and the screams also going along, rather ahead of
the policeman; and both the murder-screams and the policeman’s boots
faded away in the remote distance.

Then Robert smacked his knickerbocker loudly with his palm, and said--

‘Good old Phoenix! I should know its golden voice anywhere.’

And then every one understood how cleverly the Phoenix had caught at
what Robert had said about the real work of a policeman being to look
after murderers and thieves, and not after cats, and all hearts were
filled with admiring affection.

‘But he’ll come back,’ said Anthea, mournfully, ‘as soon as it finds the
murderer is only a bright vision of a dream, and there isn’t one at all
really.’

‘No he won’t,’ said the soft voice of the clever Phoenix, as it flew
in. ‘HE DOES NOT KNOW WHERE YOUR HOUSE IS. I heard him own as much to a
fellow mercenary. Oh! what a night we are having! Lock the door, and let
us rid ourselves of this intolerable smell of the perfume peculiar
to the musk-rat and to the house of the trimmers of beards. If you’ll
excuse me, I will go to bed. I am worn out.’

It was Cyril who wrote the paper that told the carpet to take away the
rats and bring milk, because there seemed to be no doubt in any breast
that, however Persian cats may be, they must like milk.

‘Let’s hope it won’t be musk-milk,’ said Anthea, in gloom, as she pinned
the paper face-downwards on the carpet. ‘Is there such a thing as a
musk-cow?’ she added anxiously, as the carpet shrivelled and vanished.
‘I do hope not. Perhaps really it WOULD have been wiser to let the
carpet take the cats away. It’s getting quite late, and we can’t keep
them all night.’

‘Oh, can’t we?’ was the bitter rejoinder of Robert, who had been
fastening the side door. ‘You might have consulted me,’ he went on. ‘I’m
not such an idiot as some people.’

‘Why, whatever--’

‘Don’t you see? We’ve jolly well GOT to keep the cats all night--oh, get
down, you furry beasts!--because we’ve had three wishes out of the old
carpet now, and we can’t get any more till to-morrow.’

The liveliness of Persian mews alone prevented the occurrence of a
dismal silence.

Anthea spoke first.

‘Never mind,’ she said. ‘Do you know, I really do think they’re quieting
down a bit. Perhaps they heard us say milk.’

‘They can’t understand English,’ said Jane. ‘You forget they’re Persian
cats, Panther.’

‘Well,’ said Anthea, rather sharply, for she was tired and anxious, ‘who
told you “milk” wasn’t Persian for milk. Lots of English words are
just the same in French--at least I know “miaw” is, and “croquet”, and
“fiance”. Oh, pussies, do be quiet! Let’s stroke them as hard as we can
with both hands, and perhaps they’ll stop.’

So every one stroked grey fur till their hands were tired, and as soon
as a cat had been stroked enough to make it stop mewing it was pushed
gently away, and another mewing mouser was approached by the hands of
the strokers. And the noise was really more than half purr when the
carpet suddenly appeared in its proper place, and on it, instead of rows
of milk-cans, or even of milk-jugs, there was a COW. Not a Persian cow,
either, nor, most fortunately, a musk-cow, if there is such a thing, but
a smooth, sleek, dun-coloured Jersey cow, who blinked large soft eyes at
the gas-light and mooed in an amiable if rather inquiring manner.

Anthea had always been afraid of cows; but now she tried to be brave.

‘Anyway, it can’t run after me,’ she said to herself ‘There isn’t room
for it even to begin to run.’

The cow was perfectly placid. She behaved like a strayed duchess till
some one brought a saucer for the milk, and some one else tried to milk
the cow into it. Milking is very difficult. You may think it is easy,
but it is not. All the children were by this time strung up to a pitch
of heroism that would have been impossible to them in their ordinary
condition. Robert and Cyril held the cow by the horns; and Jane, when
she was quite sure that their end of the cow was quite secure, consented
to stand by, ready to hold the cow by the tail should occasion arise.
Anthea, holding the saucer, now advanced towards the cow. She remembered
to have heard that cows, when milked by strangers, are susceptible to
the soothing influence of the human voice. So, clutching her saucer very
tight, she sought for words to whose soothing influence the cow might be
susceptible. And her memory, troubled by the events of the night, which
seemed to go on and on for ever and ever, refused to help her with any
form of words suitable to address a Jersey cow in.

‘Poor pussy, then. Lie down, then, good dog, lie down!’ was all that she
could think of to say, and she said it.

And nobody laughed. The situation, full of grey mewing cats, was too
serious for that. Then Anthea, with a beating heart, tried to milk the
cow. Next moment the cow had knocked the saucer out of her hand and
trampled on it with one foot, while with the other three she had walked
on a foot each of Robert, Cyril, and Jane.

Jane burst into tears. ‘Oh, how much too horrid everything is!’ she
cried. ‘Come away. Let’s go to bed and leave the horrid cats with the
hateful cow. Perhaps somebody will eat somebody else. And serve them
right.’

They did not go to bed, but they had a shivering council in the
drawing-room, which smelt of soot--and, indeed, a heap of this lay in
the fender. There had been no fire in the room since mother went
away, and all the chairs and tables were in the wrong places, and the
chrysanthemums were dead, and the water in the pot nearly dried up.
Anthea wrapped the embroidered woolly sofa blanket round Jane and
herself, while Robert and Cyril had a struggle, silent and brief, but
fierce, for the larger share of the fur hearthrug.

‘It is most truly awful,’ said Anthea, ‘and I am so tired. Let’s let the
cats loose.’

‘And the cow, perhaps?’ said Cyril. ‘The police would find us at once.
That cow would stand at the gate and mew--I mean moo--to come in. And so
would the cats. No; I see quite well what we’ve got to do. We must
put them in baskets and leave them on people’s doorsteps, like orphan
foundlings.’

‘We’ve got three baskets, counting mother’s work one,’ said Jane
brightening.

‘And there are nearly two hundred cats,’ said Anthea, ‘besides the
cow--and it would have to be a different-sized basket for her; and then
I don’t know how you’d carry it, and you’d never find a doorstep big
enough to put it on. Except the church one--and--’

‘Oh, well,’ said Cyril, ‘if you simply MAKE difficulties--’

‘I’m with you,’ said Robert. ‘Don’t fuss about the cow, Panther. It’s
simply GOT to stay the night, and I’m sure I’ve read that the cow is a
remunerating creature, and that means it will sit still and think
for hours. The carpet can take it away in the morning. And as for the
baskets, we’ll do them up in dusters, or pillow-cases, or bath-towels.
Come on, Squirrel. You girls can be out of it if you like.’

His tone was full of contempt, but Jane and Anthea were too tired and
desperate to care; even being ‘out of it’, which at other times they
could not have borne, now seemed quite a comfort. They snuggled down in
the sofa blanket, and Cyril threw the fur hearthrug over them.

‘Ah, he said, ‘that’s all women are fit for--to keep safe and warm,
while the men do the work and run dangers and risks and things.’

‘I’m not,’ said Anthea, ‘you know I’m not.’ But Cyril was gone.

It was warm under the blanket and the hearthrug, and Jane snuggled up
close to her sister; and Anthea cuddled Jane closely and kindly, and in
a sort of dream they heard the rise of a wave of mewing as Robert opened
the door of the nursery. They heard the booted search for baskets in
the back kitchen. They heard the side door open and close, and they
knew that each brother had gone out with at least one cat. Anthea’s
last thought was that it would take at least all night to get rid of
one hundred and ninety-nine cats by twos. There would be ninety-nine
journeys of two cats each, and one cat over.

‘I almost think we might keep the one cat over,’ said Anthea. ‘I don’t
seem to care for cats just now, but I daresay I shall again some day.’
And she fell asleep. Jane also was sleeping.

It was Jane who awoke with a start, to find Anthea still asleep. As, in
the act of awakening, she kicked her sister, she wondered idly why
they should have gone to bed in their boots; but the next moment she
remembered where they were.

There was a sound of muffled, shuffled feet on the stairs. Like the
heroine of the classic poem, Jane ‘thought it was the boys’, and as
she felt quite wide awake, and not nearly so tired as before, she crept
gently from Anthea’s side and followed the footsteps. They went down
into the basement; the cats, who seemed to have fallen into the sleep
of exhaustion, awoke at the sound of the approaching footsteps and mewed
piteously. Jane was at the foot of the stairs before she saw it was not
her brothers whose coming had roused her and the cats, but a burglar.
She knew he was a burglar at once, because he wore a fur cap and a red
and black charity-check comforter, and he had no business where he was.

If you had been stood in jane’s shoes you would no doubt have run away
in them, appealing to the police and neighbours with horrid screams. But
Jane knew better. She had read a great many nice stories about burglars,
as well as some affecting pieces of poetry, and she knew that no burglar
will ever hurt a little girl if he meets her when burgling. Indeed, in
all the cases Jane had read of, his burglarishness was almost at once
forgotten in the interest he felt in the little girl’s artless prattle.
So if Jane hesitated for a moment before addressing the burglar, it
was only because she could not at once think of any remark sufficiently
prattling and artless to make a beginning with. In the stories and the
affecting poetry the child could never speak plainly, though it always
looked old enough to in the pictures. And Jane could not make up her
mind to lisp and ‘talk baby’, even to a burglar. And while she hesitated
he softly opened the nursery door and went in.

Jane followed--just in time to see him sit down flat on the floor,
scattering cats as a stone thrown into a pool splashes water.

She closed the door softly and stood there, still wondering whether she
COULD bring herself to say, ‘What’s ‘oo doing here, Mithter Wobber?’ and
whether any other kind of talk would do.

Then she heard the burglar draw a long breath, and he spoke.

‘It’s a judgement,’ he said, ‘so help me bob if it ain’t. Oh, ‘ere’s a
thing to ‘appen to a chap! Makes it come ‘ome to you, don’t it neither?
Cats an’ cats an’ cats. There couldn’t be all them cats. Let alone the
cow. If she ain’t the moral of the old man’s Daisy. She’s a dream out of
when I was a lad--I don’t mind ‘er so much. ‘Ere, Daisy, Daisy?’

The cow turned and looked at him.

‘SHE’S all right,’ he went on. ‘Sort of company, too. Though them above
knows how she got into this downstairs parlour. But them cats--oh, take
‘em away, take ‘em away! I’ll chuck the ‘ole show--Oh, take ‘em away.’

‘Burglar,’ said Jane, close behind him, and he started convulsively,
and turned on her a blank face, whose pale lips trembled. ‘I can’t take
those cats away.’

‘Lor’ lumme!’ exclaimed the man; ‘if ‘ere ain’t another on ‘em. Are you
real, miss, or something I’ll wake up from presently?’

‘I am quite real,’ said Jane, relieved to find that a lisp was not
needed to make the burglar understand her. ‘And so,’ she added, ‘are the
cats.’

‘Then send for the police, send for the police, and I’ll go quiet. If
you ain’t no realler than them cats, I’m done, spunchuck--out of time.
Send for the police. I’ll go quiet. One thing, there’d not be room for
‘arf them cats in no cell as ever _I_ see.’

He ran his fingers through his hair, which was short, and his eyes
wandered wildly round the roomful of cats.

‘Burglar,’ said Jane, kindly and softly, ‘if you didn’t like cats, what
did you come here for?’

‘Send for the police,’ was the unfortunate criminal’s only reply. ‘I’d
rather you would--honest, I’d rather.’

‘I daren’t,’ said Jane, ‘and besides, I’ve no one to send. I hate the
police. I wish he’d never been born.’

‘You’ve a feeling ‘art, miss,’ said the burglar; ‘but them cats is
really a little bit too thick.’

‘Look here,’ said Jane, ‘I won’t call the police. And I am quite a real
little girl, though I talk older than the kind you’ve met before when
you’ve been doing your burglings. And they are real cats--and they want
real milk--and--Didn’t you say the cow was like somebody’s Daisy that
you used to know?’

‘Wish I may die if she ain’t the very spit of her,’ replied the man.

‘Well, then,’ said Jane--and a thrill of joyful pride ran through
her--‘perhaps you know how to milk cows?’

‘Perhaps I does,’ was the burglar’s cautious rejoinder.

‘Then,’ said Jane, ‘if you will ONLY milk ours--you don’t know how we
shall always love you.’

The burglar replied that loving was all very well.

‘If those cats only had a good long, wet, thirsty drink of milk,’ Jane
went on with eager persuasion, ‘they’d lie down and go to sleep as
likely as not, and then the police won’t come back. But if they go on
mewing like this he will, and then I don’t know what’ll become of us, or
you either.’

This argument seemed to decide the criminal. Jane fetched the wash-bowl
from the sink, and he spat on his hands and prepared to milk the cow. At
this instant boots were heard on the stairs.

‘It’s all up,’ said the man, desperately, ‘this ‘ere’s a plant. ‘ERE’S
the police.’ He made as if to open the window and leap from it.

‘It’s all right, I tell you,’ whispered Jane, in anguish. ‘I’ll say
you’re a friend of mine, or the good clergyman called in, or my uncle,
or ANYTHING--only do, do, do milk the cow. Oh, DON’T go--oh--oh, thank
goodness it’s only the boys!’

It was; and their entrance had awakened Anthea, who, with her brothers,
now crowded through the doorway. The man looked about him like a rat
looks round a trap.

‘This is a friend of mine,’ said Jane; ‘he’s just called in, and he’s
going to milk the cow for us. ISN’T it good and kind of him?’

She winked at the others, and though they did not understand they played
up loyally.

‘How do?’ said Cyril, ‘Very glad to meet you. Don’t let us interrupt the
milking.’

‘I shall ‘ave a ‘ead and a ‘arf in the morning, and no bloomin’ error,’
remarked the burglar; but he began to milk the cow.

Robert was winked at to stay and see that he did not leave off milking
or try to escape, and the others went to get things to put the milk in;
for it was now spurting and foaming in the wash-bowl, and the cats had
ceased from mewing and were crowding round the cow, with expressions of
hope and anticipation on their whiskered faces.

‘We can’t get rid of any more cats,’ said Cyril, as he and his sisters
piled a tray high with saucers and soup-plates and platters and
pie-dishes, ‘the police nearly got us as it was. Not the same one--a
much stronger sort. He thought it really was a foundling orphan we’d
got. If it hadn’t been for me throwing the two bags of cat slap in
his eye and hauling Robert over a railing, and lying like mice under
a laurel-bush--Well, it’s jolly lucky I’m a good shot, that’s all.
He pranced off when he’d got the cat-bags off his face--thought we’d
bolted. And here we are.’

The gentle samishness of the milk swishing into the hand-bowl seemed
to have soothed the burglar very much. He went on milking in a sort of
happy dream, while the children got a cap and ladled the warm milk out
into the pie-dishes and plates, and platters and saucers, and set them
down to the music of Persian purrs and lappings.

‘It makes me think of old times,’ said the burglar, smearing his ragged
coat-cuff across his eyes--‘about the apples in the orchard at home,
and the rats at threshing time, and the rabbits and the ferrets, and how
pretty it was seeing the pigs killed.’

Finding him in this softened mood, Jane said--

‘I wish you’d tell us how you came to choose our house for your
burglaring to-night. I am awfully glad you did. You have been so kind. I
don’t know what we should have done without you,’ she added hastily. ‘We
all love you ever so. Do tell us.’

The others added their affectionate entreaties, and at last the burglar
said--

‘Well, it’s my first job, and I didn’t expect to be made so welcome, and
that’s the truth, young gents and ladies. And I don’t know but what it
won’t be my last. For this ‘ere cow, she reminds me of my father, and I
know ‘ow ‘e’d ‘ave ‘ided me if I’d laid ‘ands on a ‘a’penny as wasn’t my
own.’

‘I’m sure he would,’ Jane agreed kindly; ‘but what made you come here?’

‘Well, miss,’ said the burglar, ‘you know best ‘ow you come by them
cats, and why you don’t like the police, so I’ll give myself away free,
and trust to your noble ‘earts. (You’d best bale out a bit, the pan’s
getting fullish.) I was a-selling oranges off of my barrow--for I ain’t
a burglar by trade, though you ‘ave used the name so free--an’ there was
a lady bought three ‘a’porth off me. An’ while she was a-pickin’ of them
out--very careful indeed, and I’m always glad when them sort gets a few
over-ripe ones--there was two other ladies talkin’ over the fence. An’
one on ‘em said to the other on ‘em just like this--

“‘I’ve told both gells to come, and they can doss in with M’ria and
Jane, ‘cause their boss and his missis is miles away and the kids too.
So they can just lock up the ‘ouse and leave the gas a-burning, so’s
no one won’t know, and get back bright an’ early by ‘leven o’clock. And
we’ll make a night of it, Mrs Prosser, so we will. I’m just a-going
to run out to pop the letter in the post.” And then the lady what had
chosen the three ha’porth so careful, she said: “Lor, Mrs Wigson, I
wonder at you, and your hands all over suds. This good gentleman’ll slip
it into the post for yer, I’ll be bound, seeing I’m a customer of his.”
 So they give me the letter, and of course I read the direction what was
written on it afore I shoved it into the post. And then when I’d sold
my barrowful, I was a-goin’ ‘ome with the chink in my pocket, and I’m
blowed if some bloomin’ thievin’ beggar didn’t nick the lot whilst I was
just a-wettin’ of my whistle, for callin’ of oranges is dry work. Nicked
the bloomin’ lot ‘e did--and me with not a farden to take ‘ome to my
brother and his missus.’

‘How awful!’ said Anthea, with much sympathy.

‘Horful indeed, miss, I believe yer,’ the burglar rejoined, with deep
feeling. ‘You don’t know her temper when she’s roused. An’ I’m sure I
‘ope you never may, neither. And I’d ‘ad all my oranges off of ‘em.
So it came back to me what was wrote on the ongverlope, and I says to
myself, “Why not, seein’ as I’ve been done myself, and if they keeps two
slaveys there must be some pickings?” An’ so ‘ere I am. But them cats,
they’ve brought me back to the ways of honestness. Never no more.’

‘Look here,’ said Cyril, ‘these cats are very valuable--very indeed. And
we will give them all to you, if only you will take them away.’

‘I see they’re a breedy lot,’ replied the burglar. ‘But I don’t want no
bother with the coppers. Did you come by them honest now? Straight?’

‘They are all our very own,’ said Anthea, ‘we wanted them, but the
confidement--’

‘Consignment,’ whispered Cyril, ‘was larger than we wanted, and they’re
an awful bother. If you got your barrow, and some sacks or baskets, your
brother’s missus would be awfully pleased. My father says Persian cats
are worth pounds and pounds each.’

‘Well,’ said the burglar--and he was certainly moved by her remarks--‘I
see you’re in a hole--and I don’t mind lending a helping ‘and. I don’t
ask ‘ow you come by them. But I’ve got a pal--‘e’s a mark on cats. I’ll
fetch him along, and if he thinks they’d fetch anything above their
skins I don’t mind doin’ you a kindness.’

‘You won’t go away and never come back,’ said Jane, ‘because I don’t
think I COULD bear that.’

The burglar, quite touched by her emotion, swore sentimentally that,
alive or dead, he would come back.

Then he went, and Cyril and Robert sent the girls to bed and sat up to
wait for his return. It soon seemed absurd to await him in a state
of wakefulness, but his stealthy tap on the window awoke them readily
enough. For he did return, with the pal and the barrow and the sacks.
The pal approved of the cats, now dormant in Persian repletion, and
they were bundled into the sacks, and taken away on the barrow--mewing,
indeed, but with mews too sleepy to attract public attention.

‘I’m a fence--that’s what I am,’ said the burglar gloomily. ‘I never
thought I’d come down to this, and all acause er my kind ‘eart.’

Cyril knew that a fence is a receiver of stolen goods, and he replied
briskly--

‘I give you my sacred the cats aren’t stolen. What do you make the
time?’

‘I ain’t got the time on me,’ said the pal--‘but it was just about
chucking-out time as I come by the “Bull and Gate”. I shouldn’t wonder
if it was nigh upon one now.’

When the cats had been removed, and the boys and the burglar had parted
with warm expressions of friendship, there remained only the cow.

‘She must stay all night,’ said Robert. ‘Cook’ll have a fit when she
sees her.’

‘All night?’ said Cyril. ‘Why--it’s tomorrow morning if it’s one. We can
have another wish!’

So the carpet was urged, in a hastily written note, to remove the cow to
wherever she belonged, and to return to its proper place on the nursery
floor. But the cow could not be got to move on to the carpet. So Robert
got the clothes line out of the back kitchen, and tied one end very
firmly to the cow’s horns, and the other end to a bunched-up corner of
the carpet, and said ‘Fire away.’

And the carpet and cow vanished together, and the boys went to bed,
tired out and only too thankful that the evening at last was over.

Next morning the carpet lay calmly in its place, but one corner was very
badly torn. It was the corner that the cow had been tied on to.



CHAPTER 9. THE BURGLAR’S BRIDE


The morning after the adventure of the Persian cats, the musk-rats, the
common cow, and the uncommon burglar, all the children slept till it was
ten o’clock; and then it was only Cyril who woke; but he attended to
the others, so that by half past ten every one was ready to help to get
breakfast. It was shivery cold, and there was but little in the house
that was really worth eating.

Robert had arranged a thoughtful little surprise for the absent
servants. He had made a neat and delightful booby trap over the kitchen
door, and as soon as they heard the front door click open and knew the
servants had come back, all four children hid in the cupboard under
the stairs and listened with delight to the entrance--the tumble, the
splash, the scuffle, and the remarks of the servants. They heard the
cook say it was a judgement on them for leaving the place to itself;
she seemed to think that a booby trap was a kind of plant that was quite
likely to grow, all by itself, in a dwelling that was left shut up. But
the housemaid, more acute, judged that someone must have been in the
house--a view confirmed by the sight of the breakfast things on the
nursery table.

The cupboard under the stairs was very tight and paraffiny, however, and
a silent struggle for a place on top ended in the door bursting open
and discharging Jane, who rolled like a football to the feet of the
servants.

‘Now,’ said Cyril, firmly, when the cook’s hysterics had become quieter,
and the housemaid had time to say what she thought of them, ‘don’t you
begin jawing us. We aren’t going to stand it. We know too much. You’ll
please make an extra special treacle roley for dinner, and we’ll have a
tinned tongue.’

‘I daresay,’ said the housemaid, indignant, still in her outdoor things
and with her hat very much on one side. ‘Don’t you come a-threatening
me, Master Cyril, because I won’t stand it, so I tell you. You tell
your ma about us being out? Much I care! She’ll be sorry for me when she
hears about my dear great-aunt by marriage as brought me up from a child
and was a mother to me. She sent for me, she did, she wasn’t expected
to last the night, from the spasms going to her legs--and cook was that
kind and careful she couldn’t let me go alone, so--’

‘Don’t,’ said Anthea, in real distress. ‘You know where liars go to,
Eliza--at least if you don’t--’

‘Liars indeed!’ said Eliza, ‘I won’t demean myself talking to you.’

‘How’s Mrs Wigson?’ said Robert, ‘and DID you keep it up last night?’

The mouth of the housemaid fell open.

‘Did you doss with Maria or Emily?’ asked Cyril.

‘How did Mrs Prosser enjoy herself?’ asked Jane.

‘Forbear,’ said Cyril, ‘they’ve had enough. Whether we tell or not
depends on your later life,’ he went on, addressing the servants. ‘If
you are decent to us we’ll be decent to you. You’d better make that
treacle roley--and if I were you, Eliza, I’d do a little housework and
cleaning, just for a change.’

The servants gave in once and for all.

‘There’s nothing like firmness,’ Cyril went on, when the breakfast
things were cleared away and the children were alone in the nursery.
‘People are always talking of difficulties with servants. It’s quite
simple, when you know the way. We can do what we like now and they won’t
peach. I think we’ve broken THEIR proud spirit. Let’s go somewhere by
carpet.’

‘I wouldn’t if I were you,’ said the Phoenix, yawning, as it swooped
down from its roost on the curtain pole. ‘I’ve given you one or two
hints, but now concealment is at an end, and I see I must speak out.’

It perched on the back of a chair and swayed to and fro, like a parrot
on a swing.

‘What’s the matter now?’ said Anthea. She was not quite so gentle as
usual, because she was still weary from the excitement of last night’s
cats. ‘I’m tired of things happening. I shan’t go anywhere on the
carpet. I’m going to darn my stockings.’

‘Darn!’ said the Phoenix, ‘darn! From those young lips these strange
expressions--’

‘Mend, then,’ said Anthea, ‘with a needle and wool.’

The Phoenix opened and shut its wings thoughtfully.

‘Your stockings,’ it said, ‘are much less important than they now appear
to you. But the carpet--look at the bare worn patches, look at the great
rent at yonder corner. The carpet has been your faithful friend--your
willing servant. How have you requited its devoted service?’

‘Dear Phoenix,’ Anthea urged, ‘don’t talk in that horrid lecturing tone.
You make me feel as if I’d done something wrong. And really it is a
wishing carpet, and we haven’t done anything else to it--only wishes.’

‘Only wishes,’ repeated the Phoenix, ruffling its neck feathers angrily,
‘and what sort of wishes? Wishing people to be in a good temper, for
instance. What carpet did you ever hear of that had such a wish asked
of it? But this noble fabric, on which you trample so recklessly’ (every
one removed its boots from the carpet and stood on the linoleum), ‘this
carpet never flinched. It did what you asked, but the wear and tear must
have been awful. And then last night--I don’t blame you about the cats
and the rats, for those were its own choice; but what carpet could stand
a heavy cow hanging on to it at one corner?’

‘I should think the cats and rats were worse,’ said Robert, ‘look at all
their claws.’

‘Yes,’ said the bird, ‘eleven thousand nine hundred and forty of them--I
daresay you noticed? I should be surprised if these had not left their
mark.’

‘Good gracious,’ said Jane, sitting down suddenly on the floor, and
patting the edge of the carpet softly; ‘do you mean it’s WEARING OUT?’

‘Its life with you has not been a luxurious one,’ said the Phoenix.

‘French mud twice. Sand of sunny shores twice. Soaking in southern seas
once. India once. Goodness knows where in Persia once. Musk-rat-land
once. And once, wherever the cow came from. Hold your carpet up to the
light, and with cautious tenderness, if YOU please.’

With cautious tenderness the boys held the carpet up to the light; the
girls looked, and a shiver of regret ran through them as they saw how
those eleven thoousand nine hundred and forty claws had run through the
carpet. It was full of little holes: there were some large ones, and
more than one thin place. At one corner a strip of it was torn, and hung
forlornly.

‘We must mend it,’ said Anthea; ‘never mind about my stockings. I can
sew them up in lumps with sewing cotton if there’s no time to do them
properly. I know it’s awful and no girl would who respected herself,
and all that; but the poor dear carpet’s more important than my silly
stockings. Let’s go out now this very minute.’

So out they all went, and bought wool to mend the carpet; but there
is no shop in Camden Town where you can buy wishing-wool, no, nor in
Kentish Town either. However, ordinary Scotch heather-mixture fingering
seemed good enough, and this they bought, and all that day Jane and
Anthea darned and darned and darned. The boys went out for a walk in
the afternoon, and the gentle Phoenix paced up and down the table--for
exercise, as it said--and talked to the industrious girls about their
carpet.

‘It is not an ordinary, ignorant, innocent carpet from Kidderminster,’
it said, ‘it is a carpet with a past--a Persian past. Do you know that
in happier years, when that carpet was the property of caliphs, viziers,
kings, and sultans, it never lay on a floor?’

‘I thought the floor was the proper home of a carpet,’ Jane interrupted.

‘Not of a MAGIC carpet,’ said the Phoenix; ‘why, if it had been allowed
to lie about on floors there wouldn’t be much of it left now. No,
indeed! It has lived in chests of cedarwood, inlaid with pearl and
ivory, wrapped in priceless tissues of cloth of gold, embroidered with
gems of fabulous value. It has reposed in the sandal-wood caskets of
princesses, and in the rose-attar-scented treasure-houses of kings.
Never, never, had any one degraded it by walking on it--except in the
way of business, when wishes were required, and then they always took
their shoes off. And YOU--’

‘Oh, DON’T!’ said Jane, very near tears. ‘You know you’d never have been
hatched at all if it hadn’t been for mother wanting a carpet for us to
walk on.’

‘You needn’t have walked so much or so hard!’ said the bird, ‘but
come, dry that crystal tear, and I will relate to you the story of the
Princess Zulieka, the Prince of Asia, and the magic carpet.’

‘Relate away,’ said Anthea--‘I mean, please do.’

‘The Princess Zulieka, fairest of royal ladies,’ began the bird, ‘had in
her cradle been the subject of several enchantments. Her grandmother had
been in her day--’

But what in her day Zulieka’s grandmother had been was destined never to
be revealed, for Cyril and Robert suddenly burst into the room, and on
each brow were the traces of deep emotion. On Cyril’s pale brow stood
beads of agitation and perspiration, and on the scarlet brow of Robert
was a large black smear.

‘What ails ye both?’ asked the Phoenix, and it added tartly that
story-telling was quite impossible if people would come interrupting
like that.

‘Oh, do shut up, for any sake!’ said Cyril, sinking into a chair.

Robert smoothed the ruffled golden feathers, adding kindly--

‘Squirrel doesn’t mean to be a beast. It’s only that the MOST AWFUL
thing has happened, and stories don’t seem to matter so much. Don’t be
cross. You won’t be when you’ve heard what’s happened.’

‘Well, what HAS happened?’ said the bird, still rather crossly; and
Anthea and Jane paused with long needles poised in air, and long
needlefuls of Scotch heather-mixture fingering wool drooping from them.

‘The most awful thing you can possibly think of,’ said Cyril. ‘That nice
chap--our own burglar--the police have got him, on suspicion of stolen
cats. That’s what his brother’s missis told me.’

‘Oh, begin at the beginning!’ cried Anthea impatiently.

‘Well, then, we went out, and down by where the undertaker’s is, with
the china flowers in the window--you know. There was a crowd, and of
course we went to have a squint. And it was two bobbies and our burglar
between them, and he was being dragged along; and he said, “I tell you
them cats was GIVE me. I got ‘em in exchange for me milking a cow in a
basement parlour up Camden Town way.”

‘And the people laughed. Beasts! And then one of the policemen said
perhaps he could give the name and address of the cow, and he said, no,
he couldn’t; but he could take them there if they’d only leave go of his
coat collar, and give him a chance to get his breath. And the policeman
said he could tell all that to the magistrate in the morning. He didn’t
see us, and so we came away.’

‘Oh, Cyril, how COULD you?’ said Anthea.

‘Don’t be a pudding-head,’ Cyril advised. ‘A fat lot of good it would
have done if we’d let him see us. No one would have believed a word we
said. They’d have thought we were kidding. We did better than let him
see us. We asked a boy where he lived and he told us, and we went there,
and it’s a little greengrocer’s shop, and we bought some Brazil nuts.
Here they are.’ The girls waved away the Brazil nuts with loathing and
contempt.

‘Well, we had to buy SOMETHING, and while we were making up our minds
what to buy we heard his brother’s missis talking. She said when he came
home with all them miaoulers she thought there was more in it than met
the eye. But he WOULD go out this morning with the two likeliest of
them, one under each arm. She said he sent her out to buy blue ribbon to
put round their beastly necks, and she said if he got three months’ hard
it was her dying word that he’d got the blue ribbon to thank for it;
that, and his own silly thieving ways, taking cats that anybody would
know he couldn’t have come by in the way of business, instead of things
that wouldn’t have been missed, which Lord knows there are plenty such,
and--’

‘Oh, STOP!’ cried Jane. And indeed it was time, for Cyril seemed like a
clock that had been wound up, and could not help going on. ‘Where is he
now?’

‘At the police-station,’ said Robert, for Cyril was out of breath. ‘The
boy told us they’d put him in the cells, and would bring him up
before the Beak in the morning. I thought it was a jolly lark last
night--getting him to take the cats--but now--’

‘The end of a lark,’ said the Phoenix, ‘is the Beak.’

‘Let’s go to him,’ cried both the girls jumping up. ‘Let’s go and tell
the truth. They MUST believe us.’

‘They CAN’T,’ said Cyril. ‘Just think! If any one came to you with such
a tale, you couldn’t believe it, however much you tried. We should only
mix things up worse for him.’

‘There must be something we could do,’ said Jane, sniffing very
much--‘my own dear pet burglar! I can’t bear it. And he was so nice,
the way he talked about his father, and how he was going to be so extra
honest. Dear Phoenix, you MUST be able to help us. You’re so good and
kind and pretty and clever. Do, do tell us what to do.’

The Phoenix rubbed its beak thoughtfully with its claw.

‘You might rescue him,’ it said, ‘and conceal him here, till the
law-supporters had forgotten about him.’

‘That would be ages and ages,’ said Cyril, ‘and we couldn’t conceal him
here. Father might come home at any moment, and if he found the burglar
here HE wouldn’t believe the true truth any more than the police would.
That’s the worst of the truth. Nobody ever believes it. Couldn’t we take
him somewhere else?’

Jane clapped her hands.

‘The sunny southern shore!’ she cried, ‘where the cook is being queen.
He and she would be company for each other!’

And really the idea did not seem bad, if only he would consent to go.

So, all talking at once, the children arranged to wait till evening, and
then to seek the dear burglar in his lonely cell.

Meantime Jane and Anthea darned away as hard as they could, to make the
carpet as strong as possible. For all felt how terrible it would be if
the precious burglar, while being carried to the sunny southern shore,
were to tumble through a hole in the carpet, and be lost for ever in the
sunny southern sea.

The servants were tired after Mrs Wigson’s party, so every one went to
bed early, and when the Phoenix reported that both servants were snoring
in a heartfelt and candid manner, the children got up--they had never
undressed; just putting their nightgowns on over their things had been
enough to deceive Eliza when she came to turn out the gas. So they were
ready for anything, and they stood on the carpet and said--

‘I wish we were in our burglar’s lonely cell.’ and instantly they were.

I think every one had expected the cell to be the ‘deepest dungeon below
the castle moat’. I am sure no one had doubted that the burglar, chained
by heavy fetters to a ring in the damp stone wall, would be tossing
uneasily on a bed of straw, with a pitcher of water and a mouldering
crust, untasted, beside him. Robert, remembering the underground passage
and the treasure, had brought a candle and matches, but these were not
needed.

The cell was a little white-washed room about twelve feet long and
six feet wide. On one side of it was a sort of shelf sloping a little
towards the wall. On this were two rugs, striped blue and yellow, and a
water-proof pillow. Rolled in the rugs, and with his head on the pillow,
lay the burglar, fast asleep. (He had had his tea, though this the
children did not know--it had come from the coffee-shop round the
corner, in very thick crockery.) The scene was plainly revealed by the
light of a gas-lamp in the passage outside, which shone into the cell
through a pane of thick glass over the door.

‘I shall gag him,’ said Cyril, ‘and Robert will hold him down. Anthea
and Jane and the Phoenix can whisper soft nothings to him while he
gradually awakes.’

This plan did not have the success it deserved, because the burglar,
curiously enough, was much stronger, even in his sleep, than Robert and
Cyril, and at the first touch of their hands he leapt up and shouted out
something very loud indeed.

Instantly steps were heard outside. Anthea threw her arms round the
burglar and whispered--

‘It’s us--the ones that gave you the cats. We’ve come to save you, only
don’t let on we’re here. Can’t we hide somewhere?’

Heavy boots sounded on the flagged passage outside, and a firm voice
shouted--

‘Here--you--stop that row, will you?’

‘All right, governor,’ replied the burglar, still with Anthea’s arms
round him; ‘I was only a-talking in my sleep. No offence.’

It was an awful moment. Would the boots and the voice come in. Yes! No!
The voice said--

‘Well, stow it, will you?’

And the boots went heavily away, along the passage and up some sounding
stone stairs.

‘Now then,’ whispered Anthea.

‘How the blue Moses did you get in?’ asked the burglar, in a hoarse
whisper of amazement.

‘On the carpet,’ said Jane, truly.

‘Stow that,’ said the burglar. ‘One on you I could ‘a’ swallowed, but
four--AND a yellow fowl.’

‘Look here,’ said Cyril, sternly, ‘you wouldn’t have believed any one if
they’d told you beforehand about your finding a cow and all those cats
in our nursery.’

‘That I wouldn’t,’ said the burglar, with whispered fervour, ‘so help me
Bob, I wouldn’t.’

‘Well, then,’ Cyril went on, ignoring this appeal to his brother, ‘just
try to believe what we tell you and act accordingly. It can’t do you any
HARM, you know,’ he went on in hoarse whispered earnestness. ‘You can’t
be very much worse off than you are now, you know. But if you’ll just
trust to us we’ll get you out of this right enough. No one saw us come
in. The question is, where would you like to go?’

‘I’d like to go to Boolong,’ was the instant reply of the burglar. ‘I’ve
always wanted to go on that there trip, but I’ve never ‘ad the ready at
the right time of the year.’

‘Boolong is a town like London,’ said Cyril, well meaning, but
inaccurate, ‘how could you get a living there?’

The burglar scratched his head in deep doubt.

‘It’s ‘ard to get a ‘onest living anywheres nowadays,’ he said, and his
voice was sad.

‘Yes, isn’t it?’ said Jane, sympathetically; ‘but how about a sunny
southern shore, where there’s nothing to do at all unless you want to.’

‘That’s my billet, miss,’ replied the burglar. ‘I never did care about
work--not like some people, always fussing about.’

‘Did you never like any sort of work?’ asked Anthea, severely.

‘Lor’, lumme, yes,’ he answered, ‘gardening was my ‘obby, so it was. But
father died afore ‘e could bind me to a nurseryman, an’--’

‘We’ll take you to the sunny southern shore,’ said Jane; ‘you’ve no idea
what the flowers are like.’

‘Our old cook’s there,’ said Anthea. ‘She’s queen--’

‘Oh, chuck it,’ the burglar whispered, clutching at his head with both
hands. ‘I knowed the first minute I see them cats and that cow as it was
a judgement on me. I don’t know now whether I’m a-standing on my hat or
my boots, so help me I don’t. If you CAN get me out, get me, and if you
can’t, get along with you for goodness’ sake, and give me a chanst
to think about what’ll be most likely to go down with the Beak in the
morning.’

‘Come on to the carpet, then,’ said Anthea, gently shoving. The others
quietly pulled, and the moment the feet of the burglar were planted on
the carpet Anthea wished:

‘I wish we were all on the sunny southern shore where cook is.’

And instantly they were. There were the rainbow sands, the tropic
glories of leaf and flower, and there, of course, was the cook, crowned
with white flowers, and with all the wrinkles of crossness and tiredness
and hard work wiped out of her face.

‘Why, cook, you’re quite pretty!’ Anthea said, as soon as she had got
her breath after the tumble-rush-whirl of the carpet. The burglar stood
rubbing his eyes in the brilliant tropic sunlight, and gazing wildly
round him on the vivid hues of the tropic land.

‘Penny plain and tuppence coloured!’ he exclaimed pensively, ‘and well
worth any tuppence, however hard-earned.’

The cook was seated on a grassy mound with her court of copper-coloured
savages around her. The burglar pointed a grimy finger at these.

‘Are they tame?’ he asked anxiously. ‘Do they bite or scratch, or do
anything to yer with poisoned arrows or oyster shells or that?’

‘Don’t you be so timid,’ said the cook. ‘Look’e ‘ere, this ‘ere’s only
a dream what you’ve come into, an’ as it’s only a dream there’s no
nonsense about what a young lady like me ought to say or not, so I’ll
say you’re the best-looking fellow I’ve seen this many a day. And the
dream goes on and on, seemingly, as long as you behaves. The things what
you has to eat and drink tastes just as good as real ones, and--’

‘Look ‘ere,’ said the burglar, ‘I’ve come ‘ere straight outer the pleece
station. These ‘ere kids’ll tell you it ain’t no blame er mine.’

‘Well, you WERE a burglar, you know,’ said the truthful Anthea gently.

‘Only because I was druv to it by dishonest blokes, as well you knows,
miss,’ rejoined the criminal. ‘Blowed if this ain’t the ‘ottest January
as I’ve known for years.’

‘Wouldn’t you like a bath?’ asked the queen, ‘and some white clothes
like me?’

‘I should only look a juggins in ‘em, miss, thanking you all the same,’
was the reply; ‘but a bath I wouldn’t resist, and my shirt was only
clean on week before last.’

Cyril and Robert led him to a rocky pool, where he bathed luxuriously.
Then, in shirt and trousers he sat on the sand and spoke.

‘That cook, or queen, or whatever you call her--her with the white bokay
on her ‘ed--she’s my sort. Wonder if she’d keep company!’

‘I should ask her.’

‘I was always a quick hitter,’ the man went on; ‘it’s a word and a blow
with me. I will.’

In shirt and trousers, and crowned with a scented flowery wreath which
Cyril hastily wove as they returned to the court of the queen, the
burglar stood before the cook and spoke.

‘Look ‘ere, miss,’ he said. ‘You an’ me being’ all forlorn-like, both on
us, in this ‘ere dream, or whatever you calls it, I’d like to tell you
straight as I likes yer looks.’

The cook smiled and looked down bashfully.

‘I’m a single man--what you might call a batcheldore. I’m mild in my
‘abits, which these kids’ll tell you the same, and I’d like to ‘ave the
pleasure of walkin’ out with you next Sunday.’

‘Lor!’ said the queen cook, ‘’ow sudden you are, mister.’

‘Walking out means you’re going to be married,’ said Anthea. ‘Why not
get married and have done with it? _I_ would.’

‘I don’t mind if I do,’ said the burglar. But the cook said--

‘No, miss. Not me, not even in a dream. I don’t say anythink ag’in the
young chap’s looks, but I always swore I’d be married in church, if at
all--and, anyway, I don’t believe these here savages would know how
to keep a registering office, even if I was to show them. No, mister,
thanking you kindly, if you can’t bring a clergyman into the dream I’ll
live and die like what I am.’

‘Will you marry her if we get a clergyman?’ asked the match-making
Anthea.

‘I’m agreeable, miss, I’m sure,’ said he, pulling his wreath straight.
‘’Ow this ‘ere bokay do tiddle a chap’s ears to be sure!’

So, very hurriedly, the carpet was spread out, and instructed to fetch
a clergyman. The instructions were written on the inside of Cyril’s cap
with a piece of billiard chalk Robert had got from the marker at the
hotel at Lyndhurst. The carpet disappeared, and more quickly than you
would have thought possible it came back, bearing on its bosom the
Reverend Septimus Blenkinsop.

The Reverend Septimus was rather a nice young man, but very much mazed
and muddled, because when he saw a strange carpet laid out at his feet,
in his own study, he naturally walked on it to examine it more closely.
And he happened to stand on one of the thin places that Jane and Anthea
had darned, so that he was half on wishing carpet and half on plain
Scotch heather-mixture fingering, which has no magic properties at all.

The effect of this was that he was only half there--so that the children
could just see through him, as though he had been a ghost. And as for
him, he saw the sunny southern shore, the cook and the burglar and the
children quite plainly; but through them all he saw, quite plainly also,
his study at home, with the books and the pictures and the marble clock
that had been presented to him when he left his last situation.

He seemed to himself to be in a sort of insane fit, so that it did not
matter what he did--and he married the burglar to the cook. The cook
said that she would rather have had a solider kind of a clergyman, one
that you couldn’t see through so plain, but perhaps this was real enough
for a dream.

And of course the clergyman, though misty, was really real, and able
to marry people, and he did. When the ceremony was over the clergyman
wandered about the island collecting botanical specimens, for he was a
great botanist, and the ruling passion was strong even in an insane fit.

There was a splendid wedding feast. Can you fancy Jane and Anthea,
and Robert and Cyril, dancing merrily in a ring, hand-in-hand with
copper-coloured savages, round the happy couple, the queen cook and the
burglar consort? There were more flowers gathered and thrown than you
have ever even dreamed of, and before the children took carpet for home
the now married-and-settled burglar made a speech.

‘Ladies and gentlemen,’ he said, ‘and savages of both kinds, only I know
you can’t understand what I’m a saying of, but we’ll let that pass.
If this is a dream, I’m on. If it ain’t, I’m onner than ever. If it’s
betwixt and between--well, I’m honest, and I can’t say more. I don’t
want no more ‘igh London society--I’ve got some one to put my arm around
of; and I’ve got the whole lot of this ‘ere island for my allotment, and
if I don’t grow some broccoli as’ll open the judge’s eye at the cottage
flower shows, well, strike me pink! All I ask is, as these young gents
and ladies’ll bring some parsley seed into the dream, and a penn’orth of
radish seed, and threepenn’orth of onion, and I wouldn’t mind goin’ to
fourpence or fippence for mixed kale, only I ain’t got a brown, so I
don’t deceive you. And there’s one thing more, you might take away the
parson. I don’t like things what I can see ‘alf through, so here’s how!’
He drained a coconut-shell of palm wine.

It was now past midnight--though it was tea-time on the island.

With all good wishes the children took their leave. They also collected
the clergyman and took him back to his study and his presentation clock.

The Phoenix kindly carried the seeds next day to the burglar and his
bride, and returned with the most satisfactory news of the happy pair.

‘He’s made a wooden spade and started on his allotment,’ it said, ‘and
she is weaving him a shirt and trousers of the most radiant whiteness.’

The police never knew how the burglar got away. In Kentish Town Police
Station his escape is still spoken of with bated breath as the Persian
mystery.

As for the Reverend Septimus Blenkinsop, he felt that he had had a
very insane fit indeed, and he was sure it was due to over-study. So he
planned a little dissipation, and took his two maiden aunts to Paris,
where they enjoyed a dazzling round of museums and picture galleries,
and came back feeling that they had indeed seen life. He never told his
aunts or any one else about the marriage on the island--because no
one likes it to be generally known if he has had insane fits, however
interesting and unusual.



CHAPTER 10. THE HOLE IN THE CARPET


     Hooray! hooray! hooray!
     Mother comes home to-day;
     Mother comes home to-day,
     Hooray! hooray! hooray!’

Jane sang this simple song directly after breakfast, and the Phoenix
shed crystal tears of affectionate sympathy.

‘How beautiful,’ it said, ‘is filial devotion!’

‘She won’t be home till past bedtime, though,’ said Robert. ‘We might
have one more carpet-day.’

He was glad that mother was coming home--quite glad, very glad; but at
the same time that gladness was rudely contradicted by a quite strong
feeling of sorrow, because now they could not go out all day on the
carpet.

‘I do wish we could go and get something nice for mother, only she’d
want to know where we got it,’ said Anthea. ‘And she’d never, never
believe it, the truth. People never do, somehow, if it’s at all
interesting.’

‘I’ll tell you what,’ said Robert. ‘Suppose we wished the carpet to take
us somewhere where we could find a purse with money in it--then we could
buy her something.’

‘Suppose it took us somewhere foreign, and the purse was covered with
strange Eastern devices, embroidered in rich silks, and full of money
that wasn’t money at all here, only foreign curiosities, then we
couldn’t spend it, and people would bother about where we got it, and we
shouldn’t know how on earth to get out of it at all.’

Cyril moved the table off the carpet as he spoke, and its leg caught
in one of Anthea’s darns and ripped away most of it, as well as a large
slit in the carpet.

‘Well, now you HAVE done it,’ said Robert.

But Anthea was a really first-class sister. She did not say a word
till she had got out the Scotch heather-mixture fingering wool and the
darning-needle and the thimble and the scissors, and by that time she
had been able to get the better of her natural wish to be thoroughly
disagreeable, and was able to say quite kindly--

‘Never mind, Squirrel, I’ll soon mend it.’

Cyril thumped her on the back. He understood exactly how she had felt,
and he was not an ungrateful brother.

‘Respecting the purse containing coins,’ the Phoenix said, scratching
its invisible ear thoughtfully with its shining claw, ‘it might be as
well, perhaps, to state clearly the amount which you wish to find, as
well as the country where you wish to find it, and the nature of the
coins which you prefer. It would be indeed a cold moment when you should
find a purse containing but three oboloi.’

‘How much is an oboloi?’

‘An obol is about twopence halfpenny,’ the Phoenix replied.

‘Yes,’ said Jane, ‘and if you find a purse I suppose it is only because
some one has lost it, and you ought to take it to the policeman.’

‘The situation,’ remarked the Phoenix, ‘does indeed bristle with
difficulties.’

‘What about a buried treasure,’ said Cyril, ‘and every one was dead that
it belonged to?’

‘Mother wouldn’t believe THAT,’ said more than one voice.

‘Suppose,’ said Robert--‘suppose we asked to be taken where we could
find a purse and give it back to the person it belonged to, and they
would give us something for finding it?’

‘We aren’t allowed to take money from strangers. You know we aren’t,
Bobs,’ said Anthea, making a knot at the end of a needleful of Scotch
heather-mixture fingering wool (which is very wrong, and you must never
do it when you are darning).

‘No, THAT wouldn’t do,’ said Cyril. ‘Let’s chuck it and go to the North
Pole, or somewhere really interesting.’

‘No,’ said the girls together, ‘there must be SOME way.’

‘Wait a sec,’ Anthea added. ‘I’ve got an idea coming. Don’t speak.’

There was a silence as she paused with the darning-needle in the air!
Suddenly she spoke:

‘I see. Let’s tell the carpet to take us somewhere where we can get the
money for mother’s present, and--and--and get it some way that she’ll
believe in and not think wrong.’

‘Well, I must say you are learning the way to get the most out of the
carpet,’ said Cyril. He spoke more heartily and kindly than usual,
because he remembered how Anthea had refrained from snarking him about
tearing the carpet.

‘Yes,’ said the Phoenix, ‘you certainly are. And you have to remember
that if you take a thing out it doesn’t stay in.’

No one paid any attention to this remark at the time, but afterwards
every one thought of it.

‘Do hurry up, Panther,’ said Robert; and that was why Anthea did hurry
up, and why the big darn in the middle of the carpet was all open and
webby like a fishing net, not tight and close like woven cloth, which is
what a good, well-behaved darn should be.

Then every one put on its outdoor things, the Phoenix fluttered on to
the mantelpiece and arranged its golden feathers in the glass, and all
was ready. Every one got on to the carpet.

‘Please go slowly, dear carpet,’ Anthea began; we like to see where
we’re going.’ And then she added the difficult wish that had been
decided on.

Next moment the carpet, stiff and raftlike, was sailing over the roofs
of Kentish Town.

‘I wish--No, I don’t mean that. I mean it’s a PITY we aren’t higher up,’
said Anthea, as the edge of the carpet grazed a chimney-pot.

‘That’s right. Be careful,’ said the Phoenix, in warning tones. ‘If you
wish when you’re on a wishing carpet, you DO wish, and there’s an end of
it.’

So for a short time no one spoke, and the carpet sailed on in calm
magnificence over St Pancras and King’s Cross stations and over the
crowded streets of Clerkenwell.

‘We’re going out Greenwich way,’ said Cyril, as they crossed the streak
of rough, tumbled water that was the Thames. ‘We might go and have a
look at the Palace.’

On and on the carpet swept, still keeping much nearer to the
chimney-pots than the children found at all comfortable. And then, just
over New Cross, a terrible thing happened.

Jane and Robert were in the middle of the carpet. Part of them was
on the carpet, and part of them--the heaviest part--was on the great
central darn.

‘It’s all very misty,’ said Jane; ‘it looks partly like out of doors
and partly like in the nursery at home. I feel as if I was going to have
measles; everything looked awfully rum then, remember.’

‘I feel just exactly the same,’ Robert said.

‘It’s the hole,’ said the Phoenix; ‘it’s not measles whatever that
possession may be.’

And at that both Robert and Jane suddenly, and at once, made a bound to
try and get on to the safer part of the carpet, and the darn gave way
and their boots went up, and the heavy heads and bodies of them went
down through the hole, and they landed in a position something between
sitting and sprawling on the flat leads on the top of a high, grey,
gloomy, respectable house whose address was 705, Amersham Road, New
Cross.

The carpet seemed to awaken to new energy as soon as it had got rid of
their weight, and it rose high in the air. The others lay down flat and
peeped over the edge of the rising carpet.

‘Are you hurt?’ cried Cyril, and Robert shouted ‘No,’ and next moment
the carpet had sped away, and Jane and Robert were hidden from the sight
of the others by a stack of smoky chimneys.

‘Oh, how awful!’ said Anthea.

‘It might have been worse,’ said the Phoenix. ‘What would have been
the sentiments of the survivors if that darn had given way when we were
crossing the river?’

‘Yes, there’s that,’ said Cyril, recovering himself. ‘They’ll be all
right. They’ll howl till some one gets them down, or drop tiles into
the front garden to attract attention of passersby. Bobs has got my
one-and-fivepence--lucky you forgot to mend that hole in my pocket,
Panther, or he wouldn’t have had it. They can tram it home.’

But Anthea would not be comforted.

‘It’s all my fault,’ she said. ‘I KNEW the proper way to darn, and I
didn’t do it. It’s all my fault. Let’s go home and patch the carpet with
your Etons--something really strong--and send it to fetch them.’

‘All right,’ said Cyril; ‘but your Sunday jacket is stronger than my
Etons. We must just chuck mother’s present, that’s all. I wish--’

‘Stop!’ cried the Phoenix; ‘the carpet is dropping to earth.’

And indeed it was.

It sank swiftly, yet steadily, and landed on the pavement of the
Deptford Road. It tipped a little as it landed, so that Cyril and Anthea
naturally walked off it, and in an instant it had rolled itself up and
hidden behind a gate-post. It did this so quickly that not a single
person in the Deptford Road noticed it. The Phoenix rustled its way into
the breast of Cyril’s coat, and almost at the same moment a well-known
voice remarked--

‘Well, I never! What on earth are you doing here?’

They were face to face with their pet uncle--their Uncle Reginald.

‘We DID think of going to Greenwich Palace and talking about Nelson,’
said Cyril, telling as much of the truth as he thought his uncle could
believe.

‘And where are the others?’ asked Uncle Reginald.

‘I don’t exactly know,’ Cyril replied, this time quite truthfully.

‘Well,’ said Uncle Reginald, ‘I must fly. I’ve a case in the County
Court. That’s the worst of being a beastly solicitor. One can’t take the
chances of life when one gets them. If only I could come with you to the
Painted Hall and give you lunch at the “Ship” afterwards! But, alas! it
may not be.’

The uncle felt in his pocket.

‘_I_ mustn’t enjoy myself,’ he said, ‘but that’s no reason why you
shouldn’t. Here, divide this by four, and the product ought to give you
some desired result. Take care of yourselves. Adieu.’

And waving a cheery farewell with his neat umbrella, the good and
high-hatted uncle passed away, leaving Cyril and Anthea to exchange
eloquent glances over the shining golden sovereign that lay in Cyril’s
hand.

‘Well!’ said Anthea.

‘Well!’ said Cyril.

‘Well!’ said the Phoenix.

‘Good old carpet!’ said Cyril, joyously.

‘It WAS clever of it--so adequate and yet so simple,’ said the Phoenix,
with calm approval.

‘Oh, come on home and let’s mend the carpet. I am a beast. I’d forgotten
the others just for a minute,’ said the conscience-stricken Anthea.

They unrolled the carpet quickly and slyly--they did not want to attract
public attention--and the moment their feet were on the carpet Anthea
wished to be at home, and instantly they were.

The kindness of their excellent uncle had made it unnecessary for them
to go to such extremes as Cyril’s Etons or Anthea’s Sunday jacket for
the patching of the carpet.

Anthea set to work at once to draw the edges of the broken darn
together, and Cyril hastily went out and bought a large piece of the
marble-patterned American oil-cloth which careful house-wives use to
cover dressers and kitchen tables. It was the strongest thing he could
think of.

Then they set to work to line the carpet throughout with the oil-cloth.
The nursery felt very odd and empty without the others, and Cyril did
not feel so sure as he had done about their being able to ‘tram it’
home. So he tried to help Anthea, which was very good of him, but not
much use to her.

The Phoenix watched them for a time, but it was plainly growing more and
more restless. It fluffed up its splendid feathers, and stood first on
one gilded claw and then on the other, and at last it said--

‘I can bear it no longer. This suspense! My Robert--who set my egg to
hatch--in the bosom of whose Norfolk raiment I have nestled so often and
so pleasantly! I think, if you’ll excuse me--’

‘Yes--DO,’ cried Anthea, ‘I wish we’d thought of asking you before.’

Cyril opened the window. The Phoenix flapped its sunbright wings and
vanished.

‘So THAT’S all right,’ said Cyril, taking up his needle and instantly
pricking his hand in a new place.


Of course I know that what you have really wanted to know about all this
time is not what Anthea and Cyril did, but what happened to Jane and
Robert after they fell through the carpet on to the leads of the house
which was called number 705, Amersham Road.

But I had to tell you the other first. That is one of the most annoying
things about stories, you cannot tell all the different parts of them at
the same time.

Robert’s first remark when he found himself seated on the damp, cold,
sooty leads was--

‘Here’s a go!’

Jane’s first act was tears.

‘Dry up, Pussy; don’t be a little duffer,’ said her brother, kindly,
‘it’ll be all right.’

And then he looked about, just as Cyril had known he would, for
something to throw down, so as to attract the attention of the wayfarers
far below in the street. He could not find anything. Curiously enough,
there were no stones on the leads, not even a loose tile. The roof was
of slate, and every single slate knew its place and kept it. But, as so
often happens, in looking for one thing he found another. There was a
trap-door leading down into the house.

And that trap-door was not fastened.

‘Stop snivelling and come here, Jane,’ he cried, encouragingly. ‘Lend a
hand to heave this up. If we can get into the house, we might sneak down
without meeting any one, with luck. Come on.’

They heaved up the door till it stood straight up, and, as they bent to
look into the hole below, the door fell back with a hollow clang on the
leads behind, and with its noise was mingled a blood-curdling scream
from underneath.

‘Discovered!’ hissed Robert. ‘Oh, my cats alive!’

They were indeed discovered.

They found themselves looking down into an attic, which was also
a lumber-room. It had boxes and broken chairs, old fenders and
picture-frames, and rag-bags hanging from nails.

In the middle of the floor was a box, open, half full of clothes. Other
clothes lay on the floor in neat piles. In the middle of the piles of
clothes sat a lady, very fat indeed, with her feet sticking out straight
in front of her. And it was she who had screamed, and who, in fact, was
still screaming.

‘Don’t!’ cried Jane, ‘please don’t! We won’t hurt you.’

‘Where are the rest of your gang?’ asked the lady, stopping short in the
middle of a scream.

‘The others have gone on, on the wishing carpet,’ said Jane truthfully.

‘The wishing carpet?’ said the lady.

‘Yes,’ said Jane, before Robert could say ‘You shut up!’ ‘You must have
read about it. The Phoenix is with them.’

Then the lady got up, and picking her way carefully between the piles of
clothes she got to the door and through it. She shut it behind her, and
the two children could hear her calling ‘Septimus! Septimus!’ in a loud
yet frightened way.

‘Now,’ said Robert quickly; ‘I’ll drop first.’

He hung by his hands and dropped through the trap-door.

‘Now you. Hang by your hands. I’ll catch you. Oh, there’s no time for
jaw. Drop, I say.’

Jane dropped.

Robert tried to catch her, and even before they had finished the
breathless roll among the piles of clothes, which was what his catching
ended in, he whispered--

‘We’ll hide--behind those fenders and things; they’ll think we’ve gone
along the roofs. Then, when all is calm, we’ll creep down the stairs and
take our chance.’

They hastily hid. A corner of an iron bedstead stuck into Robert’s side,
and Jane had only standing room for one foot--but they bore it--and when
the lady came back, not with Septimus, but with another lady, they held
their breath and their hearts beat thickly.

‘Gone!’ said the first lady; ‘poor little things--quite mad, my
dear--and at large! We must lock this room and send for the police.’

‘Let me look out,’ said the second lady, who was, if possible, older
and thinner and primmer than the first. So the two ladies dragged a box
under the trap-door and put another box on the top of it, and then they
both climbed up very carefully and put their two trim, tidy heads out of
the trap-door to look for the ‘mad children’.

‘Now,’ whispered Robert, getting the bedstead leg out of his side.

They managed to creep out from their hiding-place and out through the
door before the two ladies had done looking out of the trap-door on to
the empty leads.

Robert and Jane tiptoed down the stairs--one flight, two flights. Then
they looked over the banisters. Horror! a servant was coming up with a
loaded scuttle.

The children with one consent crept swiftly through the first open door.

The room was a study, calm and gentlemanly, with rows of books, a
writing table, and a pair of embroidered slippers warming themselves in
the fender. The children hid behind the window-curtains. As they passed
the table they saw on it a missionary-box with its bottom label torn
off, open and empty.

‘Oh, how awful!’ whispered Jane. ‘We shall never get away alive.’

‘Hush!’ said Robert, not a moment too soon, for there were steps on the
stairs, and next instant the two ladies came into the room. They did not
see the children, but they saw the empty missionary box.

‘I knew it,’ said one. ‘Selina, it WAS a gang. I was certain of it from
the first. The children were not mad. They were sent to distract our
attention while their confederates robbed the house.’

‘I am afraid you are right,’ said Selina; ‘and WHERE ARE THEY NOW?’

‘Downstairs, no doubt, collecting the silver milk-jug and sugar-basin
and the punch-ladle that was Uncle Joe’s, and Aunt Jerusha’s teaspoons.
I shall go down.’

‘Oh, don’t be so rash and heroic,’ said Selina. ‘Amelia, we must call
the police from the window. Lock the door. I WILL--I will--’

The words ended in a yell as Selina, rushing to the window, came face to
face with the hidden children.

‘Oh, don’t!’ said Jane; ‘how can you be so unkind? We AREN’T burglars,
and we haven’t any gang, and we didn’t open your missionary-box.
We opened our own once, but we didn’t have to use the money, so our
consciences made us put it back and--DON’T! Oh, I wish you wouldn’t--’

Miss Selina had seized Jane and Miss Amelia captured Robert. The
children found themselves held fast by strong, slim hands, pink at the
wrists and white at the knuckles.

‘We’ve got YOU, at any rate,’ said Miss Amelia. ‘Selina, your captive
is smaller than mine. You open the window at once and call “Murder!” as
loud as you can.

Selina obeyed; but when she had opened the window, instead of calling
‘Murder!’ she called ‘Septimus!’ because at that very moment she saw her
nephew coming in at the gate.

In another minute he had let himself in with his latch-key and had
mounted the stairs. As he came into the room Jane and Robert each
uttered a shriek of joy so loud and so sudden that the ladies leaped
with surprise, and nearly let them go.

‘It’s our own clergyman,’ cried Jane.

‘Don’t you remember us?’ asked Robert. ‘You married our burglar for
us--don’t you remember?’

‘I KNEW it was a gang,’ said Amelia. ‘Septimus, these abandoned children
are members of a desperate burgling gang who are robbing the house. They
have already forced the missionary-box and purloined its contents.’

The Reverend Septimus passed his hand wearily over his brow.

‘I feel a little faint,’ he said, ‘running upstairs so quickly.’

‘We never touched the beastly box,’ said Robert.

‘Then your confederates did,’ said Miss Selina.

‘No, no,’ said the curate, hastily. ‘_I_ opened the box myself.
This morning I found I had not enough small change for the Mothers’
Independent Unity Measles and Croup Insurance payments. I suppose this
is NOT a dream, is it?’

‘Dream? No, indeed. Search the house. I insist upon it.’

The curate, still pale and trembling, searched the house, which, of
course, was blamelessly free of burglars.

When he came back he sank wearily into his chair.

‘Aren’t you going to let us go?’ asked Robert, with furious indignation,
for there is something in being held by a strong lady that sets the
blood of a boy boiling in his veins with anger and despair. ‘We’ve never
done anything to you. It’s all the carpet. It dropped us on the leads.
WE couldn’t help it. You know how it carried you over to the island, and
you had to marry the burglar to the cook.’

‘Oh, my head!’ said the curate.

‘Never mind your head just now,’ said Robert; ‘try to be honest and
honourable, and do your duty in that state of life!’

‘This is a judgement on me for something, I suppose,’ said the Reverend
Septimus, wearily, ‘but I really cannot at the moment remember what.’

‘Send for the police,’ said Miss Selina.

‘Send for a doctor,’ said the curate.

‘Do you think they ARE mad, then,’ said Miss Amelia.

‘I think I am,’ said the curate.

Jane had been crying ever since her capture. Now she said-- ‘You aren’t
now, but perhaps you will be, if--And it would serve you jolly well
right, too.’

‘Aunt Selina,’ said the curate, ‘and Aunt Amelia, believe me, this is
only an insane dream. You will realize it soon. It has happened to me
before. But do not let us be unjust, even in a dream. Do not hold the
children; they have done no harm. As I said before, it was I who opened
the box.’

The strong, bony hands unwillingly loosened their grasp. Robert shook
himself and stood in sulky resentment. But Jane ran to the curate and
embraced him so suddenly that he had not time to defend himself.

‘You’re a dear,’ she said. ‘It IS like a dream just at first, but you
get used to it. Now DO let us go. There’s a good, kind, honourable
clergyman.’

‘I don’t know,’ said the Reverend Septimus; ‘it’s a difficult problem.
It is such a very unusual dream. Perhaps it’s only a sort of other
life--quite real enough for you to be mad in. And if you’re mad, there
might be a dream-asylum where you’d be kindly treated, and in time
restored, cured, to your sorrowing relatives. It is very hard to see
your duty plainly, even in ordinary life, and these dream-circumstances
are so complicated--’

‘If it’s a dream,’ said Robert, ‘you will wake up directly, and then
you’d be sorry if you’d sent us into a dream-asylum, because you might
never get into the same dream again and let us out, and so we might stay
there for ever, and then what about our sorrowing relatives who aren’t
in the dreams at all?’

But all the curate could now say was, ‘Oh, my head!’

And Jane and Robert felt quite ill with helplessness and hopelessness. A
really conscientious curate is a very difficult thing to manage.

And then, just as the hopelessness and the helplessness were getting to
be almost more than they could bear, the two children suddenly felt that
extraordinary shrinking feeling that you always have when you are just
going to vanish. And the next moment they had vanished, and the Reverend
Septimus was left alone with his aunts.

‘I knew it was a dream,’ he cried, wildly. ‘I’ve had something like
it before. Did you dream it too, Aunt Selina, and you, Aunt Amelia? I
dreamed that you did, you know.’

Aunt Selina looked at him and then at Aunt Amelia. Then she said
boldly--

‘What do you mean? WE haven’t been dreaming anything. You must have
dropped off in your chair.’

The curate heaved a sigh of relief.

‘Oh, if it’s only _I_,’ he said; ‘if we’d all dreamed it I could never
have believed it, never!’

Afterwards Aunt Selina said to the other aunt--

‘Yes, I know it was an untruth, and I shall doubtless be punished for it
in due course. But I could see the poor dear fellow’s brain giving way
before my very eyes. He couldn’t have stood the strain of three dreams.
It WAS odd, wasn’t it? All three of us dreaming the same thing at the
same moment. We must never tell dear Seppy. But I shall send an account
of it to the Psychical Society, with stars instead of names, you know.’

And she did. And you can read all about it in one of the society’s fat
Blue-books.

Of course, you understand what had happened? The intelligent Phoenix had
simply gone straight off to the Psammead, and had wished Robert and Jane
at home. And, of course, they were at home at once. Cyril and Anthea had
not half finished mending the carpet.

When the joyful emotions of reunion had calmed down a little, they
all went out and spent what was left of Uncle Reginald’s sovereign in
presents for mother. They bought her a pink silk handkerchief, a pair of
blue and white vases, a bottle of scent, a packet of Christmas candles,
and a cake of soap shaped and coloured like a tomato, and one that was
so like an orange that almost any one you had given it to would have
tried to peel it--if they liked oranges, of course. Also they bought a
cake with icing on, and the rest of the money they spent on flowers to
put in the vases.

When they had arranged all the things on a table, with the candles stuck
up on a plate ready to light the moment mother’s cab was heard, they
washed themselves thoroughly and put on tidier clothes.

Then Robert said, ‘Good old Psammead,’ and the others said so too.

‘But, really, it’s just as much good old Phoenix,’ said Robert. ‘Suppose
it hadn’t thought of getting the wish!’

‘Ah!’ said the Phoenix, ‘it is perhaps fortunate for you that I am such
a competent bird.’

‘There’s mother’s cab,’ cried Anthea, and the Phoenix hid and they
lighted the candles, and next moment mother was home again.

She liked her presents very much, and found their story of Uncle
Reginald and the sovereign easy and even pleasant to believe.

‘Good old carpet,’ were Cyril’s last sleepy words.

‘What there is of it,’ said the Phoenix, from the cornice-pole.



CHAPTER 11. THE BEGINNING OF THE END


‘Well, I MUST say,’ mother said, looking at the wishing carpet as it
lay, all darned and mended and backed with shiny American cloth, on the
floor of the nursery--‘I MUST say I’ve never in my life bought such a
bad bargain as that carpet.’

A soft ‘Oh!’ of contradiction sprang to the lips of Cyril, Robert, Jane,
and Anthea. Mother looked at them quickly, and said--

‘Well, of course, I see you’ve mended it very nicely, and that was sweet
of you, dears.’

‘The boys helped too,’ said the dears, honourably.

‘But, still--twenty-two and ninepence! It ought to have lasted for
years. It’s simply dreadful now. Well, never mind, darlings, you’ve
done your best. I think we’ll have coconut matting next time. A carpet
doesn’t have an easy life of it in this room, does it?’

‘It’s not our fault, mother, is it, that our boots are the really
reliable kind?’ Robert asked the question more in sorrow than in anger.

‘No, dear, we can’t help our boots,’ said mother, cheerfully, ‘but we
might change them when we come in, perhaps. It’s just an idea of mine.
I wouldn’t dream of scolding on the very first morning after I’ve come
home. Oh, my Lamb, how could you?’

This conversation was at breakfast, and the Lamb had been beautifully
good until every one was looking at the carpet, and then it was for him
but the work of a moment to turn a glass dish of syrupy blackberry jam
upside down on his young head. It was the work of a good many minutes
and several persons to get the jam off him again, and this interesting
work took people’s minds off the carpet, and nothing more was said just
then about its badness as a bargain and about what mother hoped for from
coconut matting.

When the Lamb was clean again he had to be taken care of while mother
rumpled her hair and inked her fingers and made her head ache over the
difficult and twisted house-keeping accounts which cook gave her on
dirty bits of paper, and which were supposed to explain how it was that
cook had only fivepence-half-penny and a lot of unpaid bills left out
of all the money mother had sent her for house-keeping. Mother was very
clever, but even she could not quite understand the cook’s accounts.

The Lamb was very glad to have his brothers and sisters to play with
him. He had not forgotten them a bit, and he made them play all the old
exhausting games: ‘Whirling Worlds’, where you swing the baby round and
round by his hands; and ‘Leg and Wing’, where you swing him from side
to side by one ankle and one wrist. There was also climbing Vesuvius.
In this game the baby walks up you, and when he is standing on your
shoulders, you shout as loud as you can, which is the rumbling of the
burning mountain, and then tumble him gently on to the floor, and roll
him there, which is the destruction of Pompeii.

‘All the same, I wish we could decide what we’d better say next time
mother says anything about the carpet,’ said Cyril, breathlessly ceasing
to be a burning mountain.

‘Well, you talk and decide,’ said Anthea; ‘here, you lovely ducky Lamb.
Come to Panther and play Noah’s Ark.’

The Lamb came with his pretty hair all tumbled and his face all dusty
from the destruction of Pompeii, and instantly became a baby snake,
hissing and wriggling and creeping in Anthea’s arms, as she said--


     ‘I love my little baby snake,
     He hisses when he is awake,
     He creeps with such a wriggly creep,
     He wriggles even in his sleep.’


‘Crocky,’ said the Lamb, and showed all his little teeth. So Anthea went
on--


     ‘I love my little crocodile,
     I love his truthful toothful smile;
     It is so wonderful and wide,
     I like to see it--FROM OUTSIDE.’


‘Well, you see,’ Cyril was saying; ‘it’s just the old bother. Mother
can’t believe the real true truth about the carpet, and--’

‘You speak sooth, O Cyril,’ remarked the Phoenix, coming out from the
cupboard where the blackbeetles lived, and the torn books, and the
broken slates, and odd pieces of toys that had lost the rest of
themselves. ‘Now hear the wisdom of Phoenix, the son of the Phoenix--’

‘There is a society called that,’ said Cyril.

‘Where is it? And what is a society?’ asked the bird.

‘It’s a sort of joined-together lot of people--a sort of brotherhood--a
kind of--well, something very like your temple, you know, only quite
different.’

‘I take your meaning,’ said the Phoenix. ‘I would fain see these calling
themselves Sons of the Phoenix.’

‘But what about your words of wisdom?’

‘Wisdom is always welcome,’ said the Phoenix.

‘Pretty Polly!’ remarked the Lamb, reaching his hands towards the golden
speaker.

The Phoenix modestly retreated behind Robert, and Anthea hastened to
distract the attention of the Lamb by murmuring--


     “I love my little baby rabbit;
     But oh! he has a dreadful habit
     Of paddling out among the rocks
     And soaking both his bunny socks.’


‘I don’t think you’d care about the sons of the Phoenix, really,’ said
Robert. ‘I have heard that they don’t do anything fiery. They only drink
a great deal. Much more than other people, because they drink lemonade
and fizzy things, and the more you drink of those the more good you
get.’

‘In your mind, perhaps,’ said Jane; ‘but it wouldn’t be good in your
body. You’d get too balloony.’

The Phoenix yawned.

‘Look here,’ said Anthea; ‘I really have an idea. This isn’t like a
common carpet. It’s very magic indeed. Don’t you think, if we put Tatcho
on it, and then gave it a rest, the magic part of it might grow, like
hair is supposed to do?’

‘It might,’ said Robert; ‘but I should think paraffin would do as
well--at any rate as far as the smell goes, and that seems to be the
great thing about Tatcho.’

But with all its faults Anthea’s idea was something to do, and they did
it.

It was Cyril who fetched the Tatcho bottle from father’s washhand-stand.
But the bottle had not much in it.

‘We mustn’t take it all,’ Jane said, ‘in case father’s hair began to
come off suddenly. If he hadn’t anything to put on it, it might all
drop off before Eliza had time to get round to the chemist’s for another
bottle. It would be dreadful to have a bald father, and it would all be
our fault.’

‘And wigs are very expensive, I believe,’ said Anthea. ‘Look here, leave
enough in the bottle to wet father’s head all over with in case any
emergency emerges--and let’s make up with paraffin. I expect it’s the
smell that does the good really--and the smell’s exactly the same.’

So a small teaspoonful of the Tatcho was put on the edges of the worst
darn in the carpet and rubbed carefully into the roots of the hairs of
it, and all the parts that there was not enough Tatcho for had paraffin
rubbed into them with a piece of flannel. Then the flannel was burned.
It made a gay flame, which delighted the Phoenix and the Lamb.

‘How often,’ said mother, opening the door--‘how often am I to tell you
that you are NOT to play with paraffin? What have you been doing?’

‘We have burnt a paraffiny rag,’ Anthea answered.

It was no use telling mother what they had done to the carpet. She did
not know it was a magic carpet, and no one wants to be laughed at for
trying to mend an ordinary carpet with lamp-oil.

‘Well, don’t do it again,’ said mother. ‘And now, away with melancholy!
Father has sent a telegram. Look!’ She held it out, and the children,
holding it by its yielding corners, read--


‘Box for kiddies at Garrick. Stalls for us, Haymarket. Meet Charing
Cross, 6.30.’


‘That means,’ said mother, ‘that you’re going to see “The Water Babies”
 all by your happy selves, and father and I will take you and fetch you.
Give me the Lamb, dear, and you and Jane put clean lace in your red
evening frocks, and I shouldn’t wonder if you found they wanted ironing.
This paraffin smell is ghastly. Run and get out your frocks.’

The frocks did want ironing--wanted it rather badly, as it happened;
for, being of tomato-Coloured Liberty silk, they had been found very
useful for tableaux vivants when a red dress was required for Cardinal
Richelieu. They were very nice tableaux, these, and I wish I could tell
you about them; but one cannot tell everything in a story. You would
have been specially interested in hearing about the tableau of the
Princes in the Tower, when one of the pillows burst, and the youthful
Princes were so covered with feathers that the picture might very well
have been called ‘Michaelmas Eve; or, Plucking the Geese’.

Ironing the dresses and sewing the lace in occupied some time, and no
one was dull, because there was the theatre to look forward to, and also
the possible growth of hairs on the carpet, for which every one kept
looking anxiously. By four o’clock Jane was almost sure that several
hairs were beginning to grow.

The Phoenix perched on the fender, and its conversation, as usual, was
entertaining and instructive--like school prizes are said to be. But it
seemed a little absent-minded, and even a little sad.

‘Don’t you feel well, Phoenix, dear?’ asked Anthea, stooping to take an
iron off the fire.

‘I am not sick,’ replied the golden bird, with a gloomy shake of the
head; ‘but I am getting old.’

‘Why, you’ve hardly been hatched any time at all.’

‘Time,’ remarked the Phoenix, ‘is measured by heartbeats. I’m sure the
palpitations I’ve had since I’ve known you are enough to blanch the
feathers of any bird.’

‘But I thought you lived 500 years,’ said Robert, and you’ve hardly
begun this set of years. Think of all the time that’s before you.’

‘Time,’ said the Phoenix, ‘is, as you are probably aware, merely a
convenient fiction. There is no such thing as time. I have lived in
these two months at a pace which generously counterbalances 500 years of
life in the desert. I am old, I am weary. I feel as if I ought to lay my
egg, and lay me down to my fiery sleep. But unless I’m careful I shall
be hatched again instantly, and that is a misfortune which I really
do not think I COULD endure. But do not let me intrude these desperate
personal reflections on your youthful happiness. What is the show at the
theatre to-night? Wrestlers? Gladiators? A combat of cameleopards and
unicorns?’

‘I don’t think so,’ said Cyril; ‘it’s called “The Water Babies”, and
if it’s like the book there isn’t any gladiating in it. There are
chimney-sweeps and professors, and a lobster and an otter and a salmon,
and children living in the water.’

‘It sounds chilly.’ The Phoenix shivered, and went to sit on the tongs.

‘I don’t suppose there will be REAL water,’ said Jane. ‘And theatres are
very warm and pretty, with a lot of gold and lamps. Wouldn’t you like to
come with us?’

‘_I_ was just going to say that,’ said Robert, in injured tones, ‘only
I know how rude it is to interrupt. Do come, Phoenix, old chap; it will
cheer you up. It’ll make you laugh like any thing. Mr Bourchier always
makes ripping plays. You ought to have seen “Shock-headed Peter” last
year.’

‘Your words are strange,’ said the Phoenix, ‘but I will come with you.
The revels of this Bourchier, of whom you speak, may help me to forget
the weight of my years.’ So that evening the Phoenix snugged inside the
waistcoat of Robert’s Etons--a very tight fit it seemed both to Robert
and to the Phoenix--and was taken to the play.

Robert had to pretend to be cold at the glittering, many-mirrored
restaurant where they ate dinner, with father in evening dress, with
a very shiny white shirt-front, and mother looking lovely in her grey
evening dress, that changes into pink and green when she moves. Robert
pretended that he was too cold to take off his great-coat, and so sat
sweltering through what would otherwise have been a most thrilling meal.
He felt that he was a blot on the smart beauty of the family, and he
hoped the Phoenix knew what he was suffering for its sake. Of course,
we are all pleased to suffer for the sake of others, but we like them
to know it unless we are the very best and noblest kind of people, and
Robert was just ordinary.

Father was full of jokes and fun, and every one laughed all the time,
even with their mouths full, which is not manners. Robert thought father
would not have been quite so funny about his keeping his over-coat on if
father had known all the truth. And there Robert was probably right.

When dinner was finished to the last grape and the last paddle in the
finger glasses--for it was a really truly grown-up dinner--the children
were taken to the theatre, guided to a box close to the stage, and left.

Father’s parting words were: ‘Now, don’t you stir out of this box,
whatever you do. I shall be back before the end of the play. Be good
and you will be happy. Is this zone torrid enough for the abandonment of
great-coats, Bobs? No? Well, then, I should say you were sickening for
something--mumps or measles or thrush or teething. Goodbye.’

He went, and Robert was at last able to remove his coat, mop his
perspiring brow, and release the crushed and dishevelled Phoenix. Robert
had to arrange his damp hair at the looking-glass at the back of the
box, and the Phoenix had to preen its disordered feathers for some time
before either of them was fit to be seen.

They were very, very early. When the lights went up fully, the Phoenix,
balancing itself on the gilded back of a chair, swayed in ecstasy.

‘How fair a scene is this!’ it murmured; ‘how far fairer than my temple!
Or have I guessed aright? Have you brought me hither to lift up my heart
with emotions of joyous surprise? Tell me, my Robert, is it not that
this, THIS is my true temple, and the other was but a humble shrine
frequented by outcasts?’

‘I don’t know about outcasts,’ said Robert, ‘but you can call this your
temple if you like. Hush! the music is beginning.’

I am not going to tell you about the play. As I said before, one can’t
tell everything, and no doubt you saw ‘The Water Babies’ yourselves. If
you did not it was a shame, or, rather, a pity.

What I must tell you is that, though Cyril and Jane and Robert and
Anthea enjoyed it as much as any children possibly could, the pleasure
of the Phoenix was far, far greater than theirs.

‘This is indeed my temple,’ it said again and again. ‘What radiant
rites! And all to do honour to me!’

The songs in the play it took to be hymns in its honour. The choruses
were choric songs in its praise. The electric lights, it said, were
magic torches lighted for its sake, and it was so charmed with the
footlights that the children could hardly persuade it to sit still. But
when the limelight was shown it could contain its approval no longer. It
flapped its golden wings, and cried in a voice that could be heard all
over the theatre:

‘Well done, my servants! Ye have my favour and my countenance!’

Little Tom on the stage stopped short in what he was saying. A deep
breath was drawn by hundreds of lungs, every eye in the house turned to
the box where the luckless children cringed, and most people hissed, or
said ‘Shish!’ or ‘Turn them out!’

Then the play went on, and an attendant presently came to the box and
spoke wrathfully.

‘It wasn’t us, indeed it wasn’t,’ said Anthea, earnestly; ‘it was the
bird.’

The man said well, then, they must keep their bird very quiet.
‘Disturbing every one like this,’ he said.

‘It won’t do it again,’ said Robert, glancing imploringly at the golden
bird; ‘I’m sure it won’t.’

‘You have my leave to depart,’ said the Phoenix gently.

‘Well, he is a beauty, and no mistake,’ said the attendant, ‘only I’d
cover him up during the acts. It upsets the performance.’

And he went.

‘Don’t speak again, there’s a dear,’ said Anthea; ‘you wouldn’t like to
interfere with your own temple, would you?’

So now the Phoenix was quiet, but it kept whispering to the children. It
wanted to know why there was no altar, no fire, no incense, and became
so excited and fretful and tiresome that four at least of the party of
five wished deeply that it had been left at home.

What happened next was entirely the fault of the Phoenix. It was not
in the least the fault of the theatre people, and no one could ever
understand afterwards how it did happen. No one, that is, except the
guilty bird itself and the four children. The Phoenix was balancing
itself on the gilt back of the chair, swaying backwards and forwards and
up and down, as you may see your own domestic parrot do. I mean the grey
one with the red tail. All eyes were on the stage, where the lobster
was delighting the audience with that gem of a song, ‘If you can’t walk
straight, walk sideways!’ when the Phoenix murmured warmly--

‘No altar, no fire, no incense!’ and then, before any of the children
could even begin to think of stopping it, it spread its bright wings and
swept round the theatre, brushing its gleaming feathers against delicate
hangings and gilded woodwork.

It seemed to have made but one circular wing-sweep, such as you may see
a gull make over grey water on a stormy day. Next moment it was perched
again on the chair-back--and all round the theatre, where it had passed,
little sparks shone like tinsel seeds, then little smoke wreaths curled
up like growing plants--little flames opened like flower-buds. People
whispered--then people shrieked.

‘Fire! Fire!’ The curtain went down--the lights went up.

‘Fire!’ cried every one, and made for the doors.

‘A magnificent idea!’ said the Phoenix, complacently. ‘An enormous
altar--fire supplied free of charge. Doesn’t the incense smell
delicious?’

The only smell was the stifling smell of smoke, of burning silk, or
scorching varnish.

The little flames had opened now into great flame-flowers. The people in
the theatre were shouting and pressing towards the doors.

‘Oh, how COULD you!’ cried Jane. ‘Let’s get out.’

‘Father said stay here,’ said Anthea, very pale, and trying to speak in
her ordinary voice.

‘He didn’t mean stay and be roasted,’ said Robert. ‘No boys on burning
decks for me, thank you.’

‘Not much,’ said Cyril, and he opened the door of the box.

But a fierce waft of smoke and hot air made him shut it again. It was
not possible to get out that way.

They looked over the front of the box. Could they climb down?

It would be possible, certainly; but would they be much better off?

‘Look at the people,’ moaned Anthea; ‘we couldn’t get through.’

And, indeed, the crowd round the doors looked as thick as flies in the
jam-making season.

‘I wish we’d never seen the Phoenix,’ cried Jane.

Even at that awful moment Robert looked round to see if the bird
had overheard a speech which, however natural, was hardly polite or
grateful.

The Phoenix was gone.

‘Look here,’ said Cyril, ‘I’ve read about fires in papers; I’m sure it’s
all right. Let’s wait here, as father said.’

‘We can’t do anything else,’ said Anthea bitterly.

‘Look here,’ said Robert, ‘I’m NOT frightened--no, I’m not. The Phoenix
has never been a skunk yet, and I’m certain it’ll see us through
somehow. I believe in the Phoenix!’

‘The Phoenix thanks you, O Robert,’ said a golden voice at his feet, and
there was the Phoenix itself, on the Wishing Carpet.

‘Quick!’ it said. ‘Stand on those portions of the carpet which are truly
antique and authentic--and--’

A sudden jet of flame stopped its words. Alas! the Phoenix had
unconsciously warmed to its subject, and in the unintentional heat of
the moment had set fire to the paraffin with which that morning the
children had anointed the carpet. It burned merrily. The children tried
in vain to stamp it out. They had to stand back and let it burn itself
out. When the paraffin had burned away it was found that it had taken
with it all the darns of Scotch heather-mixture fingering. Only the
fabric of the old carpet was left--and that was full of holes.

‘Come,’ said the Phoenix, ‘I’m cool now.’

The four children got on to what was left of the carpet. Very careful
they were not to leave a leg or a hand hanging over one of the holes. It
was very hot--the theatre was a pit of fire. Every one else had got out.

Jane had to sit on Anthea’s lap.

‘Home!’ said Cyril, and instantly the cool draught from under the
nursery door played upon their legs as they sat. They were all on
the carpet still, and the carpet was lying in its proper place on the
nursery floor, as calm and unmoved as though it had never been to the
theatre or taken part in a fire in its life.

Four long breaths of deep relief were instantly breathed. The draught
which they had never liked before was for the moment quite pleasant. And
they were safe. And every one else was safe. The theatre had been quite
empty when they left. Every one was sure of that.

They presently found themselves all talking at once. Somehow none of
their adventures had given them so much to talk about. None other had
seemed so real.

‘Did you notice--?’ they said, and ‘Do you remember--?’

When suddenly Anthea’s face turned pale under the dirt which it had
collected on it during the fire.

‘Oh,’ she cried, ‘mother and father! Oh, how awful! They’ll think we’re
burned to cinders. Oh, let’s go this minute and tell them we aren’t.’

‘We should only miss them,’ said the sensible Cyril.

‘Well--YOU go then,’ said Anthea, ‘or I will. Only do wash your face
first. Mother will be sure to think you are burnt to a cinder if she
sees you as black as that, and she’ll faint or be ill or something. Oh,
I wish we’d never got to know that Phoenix.’

‘Hush!’ said Robert; ‘it’s no use being rude to the bird. I suppose it
can’t help its nature. Perhaps we’d better wash too. Now I come to think
of it my hands are rather--’

No one had noticed the Phoenix since it had bidden them to step on the
carpet. And no one noticed that no one had noticed.

All were partially clean, and Cyril was just plunging into his
great-coat to go and look for his parents--he, and not unjustly, called
it looking for a needle in a bundle of hay--when the sound of father’s
latchkey in the front door sent every one bounding up the stairs.

‘Are you all safe?’ cried mother’s voice; ‘are you all safe?’ and the
next moment she was kneeling on the linoleum of the hall, trying to
kiss four damp children at once, and laughing and crying by turns, while
father stood looking on and saying he was blessed or something.

‘But how did you guess we’d come home,’ said Cyril, later, when every
one was calm enough for talking.

‘Well, it was rather a rum thing. We heard the Garrick was on fire, and
of course we went straight there,’ said father, briskly. ‘We couldn’t
find you, of course--and we couldn’t get in--but the firemen told
us every one was safely out. And then I heard a voice at my ear say,
“Cyril, Anthea, Robert, and Jane”--and something touched me on the
shoulder. It was a great yellow pigeon, and it got in the way of my
seeing who’d spoken. It fluttered off, and then some one said in the
other ear, “They’re safe at home”; and when I turned again, to see who
it was speaking, hanged if there wasn’t that confounded pigeon on my
other shoulder. Dazed by the fire, I suppose. Your mother said it was
the voice of--’

‘I said it was the bird that spoke,’ said mother, ‘and so it was. Or at
least I thought so then. It wasn’t a pigeon. It was an orange-coloured
cockatoo. I don’t care who it was that spoke. It was true and you’re
safe.’

Mother began to cry again, and father said bed was a good place after
the pleasures of the stage.

So every one went there.

Robert had a talk to the Phoenix that night.

‘Oh, very well,’ said the bird, when Robert had said what he felt,
‘didn’t you know that I had power over fire? Do not distress yourself.
I, like my high priests in Lombard Street, can undo the work of flames.
Kindly open the casement.’

It flew out.

That was why the papers said next day that the fire at the theatre had
done less damage than had been anticipated. As a matter of fact it had
done none, for the Phoenix spent the night in putting things straight.
How the management accounted for this, and how many of the theatre
officials still believe that they were mad on that night will never be
known.


Next day mother saw the burnt holes in the carpet.

‘It caught where it was paraffiny,’ said Anthea.

‘I must get rid of that carpet at once,’ said mother.

But what the children said in sad whispers to each other, as they
pondered over last night’s events, was--

‘We must get rid of that Phoenix.’



CHAPTER 12. THE END OF THE END


‘Egg, toast, tea, milk, tea-cup and saucer, egg-spoon, knife,
butter--that’s all, I think,’ remarked Anthea, as she put the last
touches to mother’s breakfast-tray, and went, very carefully up the
stairs, feeling for every step with her toes, and holding on to the tray
with all her fingers. She crept into mother’s room and set the tray on a
chair. Then she pulled one of the blinds up very softly.

‘Is your head better, mammy dear?’ she asked, in the soft little voice
that she kept expressly for mother’s headaches. ‘I’ve brought your
brekkie, and I’ve put the little cloth with clover-leaves on it, the one
I made you.’

‘That’s very nice,’ said mother sleepily.

Anthea knew exactly what to do for mothers with headaches who had
breakfast in bed. She fetched warm water and put just enough eau de
Cologne in it, and bathed mother’s face and hands with the sweet-scented
water. Then mother was able to think about breakfast.

‘But what’s the matter with my girl?’ she asked, when her eyes got used
to the light.

‘Oh, I’m so sorry you’re ill,’ Anthea said. ‘It’s that horrible fire and
you being so frightened. Father said so. And we all feel as if it was
our faults. I can’t explain, but--’

‘It wasn’t your fault a bit, you darling goosie,’ mother said. ‘How
could it be?’

‘That’s just what I can’t tell you,’ said Anthea. ‘I haven’t got
a futile brain like you and father, to think of ways of explaining
everything.’

Mother laughed.

‘My futile brain--or did you mean fertile?--anyway, it feels very stiff
and sore this morning--but I shall be quite all right by and by. And
don’t be a silly little pet girl. The fire wasn’t your faults. No; I
don’t want the egg, dear. I’ll go to sleep again, I think. Don’t you
worry. And tell cook not to bother me about meals. You can order what
you like for lunch.’

Anthea closed the door very mousily, and instantly went downstairs and
ordered what she liked for lunch. She ordered a pair of turkeys, a large
plum-pudding, cheese-cakes, and almonds and raisins.

Cook told her to go along, do. And she might as well not have ordered
anything, for when lunch came it was just hashed mutton and semolina
pudding, and cook had forgotten the sippets for the mutton hash and the
semolina pudding was burnt.

When Anthea rejoined the others she found them all plunged in the gloom
where she was herself. For every one knew that the days of the carpet
were now numbered. Indeed, so worn was it that you could almost have
numbered its threads.

So that now, after nearly a month of magic happenings, the time was at
hand when life would have to go on in the dull, ordinary way and Jane,
Robert, Anthea, and Cyril would be just in the same position as the
other children who live in Camden Town, the children whom these four had
so often pitied, and perhaps a little despised.

‘We shall be just like them,’ Cyril said.

‘Except,’ said Robert, ‘that we shall have more things to remember and
be sorry we haven’t got.’

‘Mother’s going to send away the carpet as soon as she’s well enough to
see about that coconut matting. Fancy us with coconut-matting--us! And
we’ve walked under live coconut-trees on the island where you can’t have
whooping-cough.’

‘Pretty island,’ said the Lamb; ‘paint-box sands and sea all shiny
sparkly.’

His brothers and sisters had often wondered whether he remembered that
island. Now they knew that he did.

‘Yes,’ said Cyril; ‘no more cheap return trips by carpet for us--that’s
a dead cert.’

They were all talking about the carpet, but what they were all thinking
about was the Phoenix.

The golden bird had been so kind, so friendly, so polite, so
instructive--and now it had set fire to a theatre and made mother ill.

Nobody blamed the bird. It had acted in a perfectly natural manner. But
every one saw that it must not be asked to prolong its visit. Indeed, in
plain English it must be asked to go!

The four children felt like base spies and treacherous friends; and each
in its mind was saying who ought not to be the one to tell the Phoenix
that there could no longer be a place for it in that happy home in
Camden Town. Each child was quite sure that one of them ought to speak
out in a fair and manly way, but nobody wanted to be the one.

They could not talk the whole thing over as they would have liked to do,
because the Phoenix itself was in the cupboard, among the blackbeetles
and the odd shoes and the broken chessmen.

But Anthea tried.

‘It’s very horrid. I do hate thinking things about people, and not being
able to say the things you’re thinking because of the way they would
feel when they thought what things you were thinking, and wondered
what they’d done to make you think things like that, and why you were
thinking them.’

Anthea was so anxious that the Phoenix should not understand what she
said that she made a speech completely baffling to all. It was not till
she pointed to the cupboard in which all believed the Phoenix to be that
Cyril understood.

‘Yes,’ he said, while Jane and Robert were trying to tell each other how
deeply they didn’t understand what Anthea were saying; ‘but after recent
eventfulnesses a new leaf has to be turned over, and, after all,
mother is more important than the feelings of any of the lower forms of
creation, however unnatural.’

‘How beautifully you do do it,’ said Anthea, absently beginning to build
a card-house for the Lamb--‘mixing up what you’re saying, I mean. We
ought to practise doing it so as to be ready for mysterious occasions.
We’re talking about THAT,’ she said to Jane and Robert, frowning, and
nodding towards the cupboard where the Phoenix was. Then Robert and Jane
understood, and each opened its mouth to speak.

‘Wait a minute,’ said Anthea quickly; ‘the game is to twist up what you
want to say so that no one can understand what you’re saying except the
people you want to understand it, and sometimes not them.’

‘The ancient philosophers,’ said a golden voice, ‘Well understood the
art of which you speak.’

Of course it was the Phoenix, who had not been in the cupboard at all,
but had been cocking a golden eye at them from the cornice during the
whole conversation.

‘Pretty dickie!’ remarked the Lamb. ‘CANARY dickie!’

‘Poor misguided infant,’ said the Phoenix.

There was a painful pause; the four could not but think it likely that
the Phoenix had understood their very veiled allusions, accompanied as
they had been by gestures indicating the cupboard. For the Phoenix was
not wanting in intelligence.

‘We were just saying--’ Cyril began, and I hope he was not going to
say anything but the truth. Whatever it was he did not say it, for the
Phoenix interrupted him, and all breathed more freely as it spoke.

‘I gather,’ it said, ‘that you have some tidings of a fatal nature to
communicate to our degraded black brothers who run to and fro for ever
yonder.’ It pointed a claw at the cupboard, where the blackbeetles
lived.

‘Canary TALK,’ said the Lamb joyously; ‘go and show mammy.’

He wriggled off Anthea’s lap.

‘Mammy’s asleep,’ said Jane, hastily. ‘Come and be wild beasts in a cage
under the table.’

But the Lamb caught his feet and hands, and even his head, so often and
so deeply in the holes of the carpet that the cage, or table, had to be
moved on to the linoleum, and the carpet lay bare to sight with all its
horrid holes.

‘Ah,’ said the bird, ‘it isn’t long for this world.’

‘No,’ said Robert; ‘everything comes to an end. It’s awful.’

‘Sometimes the end is peace,’ remarked the Phoenix. ‘I imagine that
unless it comes soon the end of your carpet will be pieces.’

‘Yes,’ said Cyril, respectfully kicking what was left of the carpet. The
movement of its bright colours caught the eye of the Lamb, who went down
on all fours instantly and began to pull at the red and blue threads.

‘Aggedydaggedygaggedy,’ murmured the Lamb; ‘daggedy ag ag ag!’

And before any one could have winked (even if they had wanted to, and it
would not have been of the slightest use) the middle of the floor showed
bare, an island of boards surrounded by a sea of linoleum. The magic
carpet was gone, AND SO WAS THE LAMB!

There was a horrible silence. The Lamb--the baby, all alone--had been
wafted away on that untrustworthy carpet, so full of holes and magic.
And no one could know where he was. And no one could follow him because
there was now no carpet to follow on.

Jane burst into tears, but Anthea, though pale and frantic, was
dry-eyed.

‘It MUST be a dream,’ she said.

‘That’s what the clergyman said,’ remarked Robert forlornly; ‘but it
wasn’t, and it isn’t.’

‘But the Lamb never wished,’ said Cyril; ‘he was only talking Bosh.’

‘The carpet understands all speech,’ said the Phoenix, ‘even Bosh. I
know not this Boshland, but be assured that its tongue is not unknown to
the carpet.’

‘Do you mean, then,’ said Anthea, in white terror, ‘that when he was
saying “Agglety dag,” or whatever it was, that he meant something by
it?’

‘All speech has meaning,’ said the Phoenix.

‘There I think you’re wrong,’ said Cyril; ‘even people who talk English
sometimes say things that don’t mean anything in particular.’

‘Oh, never mind that now,’ moaned Anthea; ‘you think “Aggety dag” meant
something to him and the carpet?’

‘Beyond doubt it held the same meaning to the carpet as to the luckless
infant,’ the Phoenix said calmly.

‘And WHAT did it mean? Oh WHAT?’

‘Unfortunately,’ the bird rejoined, ‘I never studied Bosh.’

Jane sobbed noisily, but the others were calm with what is sometimes
called the calmness of despair. The Lamb was gone--the Lamb, their own
precious baby brother--who had never in his happy little life been for a
moment out of the sight of eyes that loved him--he was gone. He had gone
alone into the great world with no other companion and protector than a
carpet with holes in it. The children had never really understood
before what an enormously big place the world is. And the Lamb might be
anywhere in it!

‘And it’s no use going to look for him.’ Cyril, in flat and wretched
tones, only said what the others were thinking.

‘Do you wish him to return?’ the Phoenix asked; it seemed to speak with
some surprise.

‘Of course we do!’ cried everybody.

‘Isn’t he more trouble than he’s worth?’ asked the bird doubtfully.

‘No, no. Oh, we do want him back! We do!’

‘Then,’ said the wearer of gold plumage, ‘if you’ll excuse me, I’ll just
pop out and see what I can do.’

Cyril flung open the window, and the Phoenix popped out.

‘Oh, if only mother goes on sleeping! Oh, suppose she wakes up and wants
the Lamb! Oh, suppose the servants come! Stop crying, Jane. It’s no
earthly good. No, I’m not crying myself--at least I wasn’t till you said
so, and I shouldn’t anyway if--if there was any mortal thing we could
do. Oh, oh, oh!’

Cyril and Robert were boys, and boys never cry, of course. Still, the
position was a terrible one, and I do not wonder that they made faces in
their efforts to behave in a really manly way.

And at this awful moment mother’s bell rang.

A breathless stillness held the children. Then Anthea dried her eyes.
She looked round her and caught up the poker. She held it out to Cyril.

‘Hit my hand hard,’ she said; ‘I must show mother some reason for my
eyes being like they are. Harder,’ she cried as Cyril gently tapped her
with the iron handle. And Cyril, agitated and trembling, nerved himself
to hit harder, and hit very much harder than he intended.

Anthea screamed.

‘Oh, Panther, I didn’t mean to hurt, really,’ cried Cyril, clattering
the poker back into the fender.

‘It’s--all--right,’ said Anthea breathlessly, clasping the hurt hand
with the one that wasn’t hurt; ‘it’s--getting--red.’

It was--a round red and blue bump was rising on the back of it. ‘Now,
Robert,’ she said, trying to breathe more evenly, ‘you go out--oh, I
don’t know where--on to the dustbin--anywhere--and I shall tell mother
you and the Lamb are out.’

Anthea was now ready to deceive her mother for as long as ever she
could. Deceit is very wrong, we know, but it seemed to Anthea that it
was her plain duty to keep her mother from being frightened about the
Lamb as long as possible. And the Phoenix might help.

‘It always has helped,’ Robert said; ‘it got us out of the tower, and
even when it made the fire in the theatre it got us out all right. I’m
certain it will manage somehow.’

Mother’s bell rang again.

‘Oh, Eliza’s never answered it,’ cried Anthea; ‘she never does. Oh, I
must go.’

And she went.

Her heart beat bumpingly as she climbed the stairs. Mother would be
certain to notice her eyes--well, her hand would account for that. But
the Lamb--

‘No, I must NOT think of the Lamb, she said to herself, and bit her
tongue till her eyes watered again, so as to give herself something
else to think of. Her arms and legs and back, and even her tear-reddened
face, felt stiff with her resolution not to let mother be worried if she
could help it.

She opened the door softly.

‘Yes, mother?’ she said.

‘Dearest,’ said mother, ‘the Lamb--’

Anthea tried to be brave. She tried to say that the Lamb and Robert were
out. Perhaps she tried too hard. Anyway, when she opened her mouth no
words came. So she stood with it open. It seemed easier to keep from
crying with one’s mouth in that unusual position.

‘The Lamb,’ mother went on; ‘he was very good at first, but he’s pulled
the toilet-cover off the dressing-table with all the brushes and
pots and things, and now he’s so quiet I’m sure he’s in some dreadful
mischief. And I can’t see him from here, and if I’d got out of bed to
see I’m sure I should have fainted.’

‘Do you mean he’s HERE?’ said Anthea.

‘Of course he’s here,’ said mother, a little impatiently. ‘Where did you
think he was?’

Anthea went round the foot of the big mahogany bed. There was a pause.

‘He’s not here NOW,’ she said.

That he had been there was plain, from the toilet-cover on the floor,
the scattered pots and bottles, the wandering brushes and combs, all
involved in the tangle of ribbons and laces which an open drawer had
yielded to the baby’s inquisitive fingers.

‘He must have crept out, then,’ said mother; ‘do keep him with you,
there’s a darling. If I don’t get some sleep I shall be a wreck when
father comes home.’

Anthea closed the door softly. Then she tore downstairs and burst into
the nursery, crying--

‘He must have wished he was with mother. He’s been there all the time.
“Aggety dag--“’

The unusual word was frozen on her lip, as people say in books.

For there, on the floor, lay the carpet, and on the carpet, surrounded
by his brothers and by Jane, sat the Lamb. He had covered his face and
clothes with vaseline and violet powder, but he was easily recognizable
in spite of this disguise.

‘You are right,’ said the Phoenix, who was also present; ‘it is evident
that, as you say, “Aggety dag” is Bosh for “I want to be where my mother
is,” and so the faithful carpet understood it.’

‘But how,’ said Anthea, catching up the Lamb and hugging him--‘how did
he get back here?’

‘Oh,’ said the Phoenix, ‘I flew to the Psammead and wished that your
infant brother were restored to your midst, and immediately it was so.’

‘Oh, I am glad, I am glad!’ cried Anthea, still hugging the baby. ‘Oh,
you darling! Shut up, Jane! I don’t care HOW much he comes off on
me! Cyril! You and Robert roll that carpet up and put it in the
beetle-cupboard. He might say “Aggety dag” again, and it might mean
something quite different next time. Now, my Lamb, Panther’ll clean you
a little. Come on.’

‘I hope the beetles won’t go wishing,’ said Cyril, as they rolled up the
carpet.


Two days later mother was well enough to go out, and that evening the
coconut matting came home. The children had talked and talked, and
thought and thought, but they had not found any polite way of telling
the Phoenix that they did not want it to stay any longer.

The days had been days spent by the children in embarrassment, and by
the Phoenix in sleep.

And, now the matting was laid down, the Phoenix awoke and fluttered down
on to it.

It shook its crested head.

‘I like not this carpet,’ it said; ‘it is harsh and unyielding, and it
hurts my golden feet.’

‘We’ve jolly well got to get used to its hurting OUR golden feet,’ said
Cyril.

‘This, then,’ said the bird, ‘supersedes the Wishing Carpet.’

‘Yes,’ said Robert, ‘if you mean that it’s instead of it.’

‘And the magic web?’ inquired the Phoenix, with sudden eagerness.

‘It’s the rag-and-bottle man’s day to-morrow,’ said Anthea, in a low
voice; ‘he will take it away.’

The Phoenix fluttered up to its favourite perch on the chair-back.

‘Hear me!’ it cried, ‘oh youthful children of men, and restrain your
tears of misery and despair, for what must be must be, and I would not
remember you, thousands of years hence, as base ingrates and crawling
worms compact of low selfishness.’

‘I should hope not, indeed,’ said Cyril.

‘Weep not,’ the bird went on; ‘I really do beg that you won’t weep.

I will not seek to break the news to you gently. Let the blow fall at
once. The time has come when I must leave you.’

All four children breathed forth a long sigh of relief.

‘We needn’t have bothered so about how to break the news to it,’
whispered Cyril.

‘Ah, sigh not so,’ said the bird, gently. ‘All meetings end in partings.
I must leave you. I have sought to prepare you for this. Ah, do not give
way!’

‘Must you really go--so soon?’ murmured Anthea. It was what she had
often heard her mother say to calling ladies in the afternoon.

‘I must, really; thank you so much, dear,’ replied the bird, just as
though it had been one of the ladies.

‘I am weary,’ it went on. ‘I desire to rest--after all the happenings
of this last moon I do desire really to rest, and I ask of you one last
boon.’

‘Any little thing we can do,’ said Robert.

Now that it had really come to parting with the Phoenix, whose favourite
he had always been, Robert did feel almost as miserable as the Phoenix
thought they all did.

‘I ask but the relic designed for the rag-and-bottle man. Give me what
is left of the carpet and let me go.’

‘Dare we?’ said Anthea. ‘Would mother mind?’

‘I have dared greatly for your sakes,’ remarked the bird.

‘Well, then, we will,’ said Robert.

The Phoenix fluffed out its feathers joyously.

‘Nor shall you regret it, children of golden hearts,’ it said.
‘Quick--spread the carpet and leave me alone; but first pile high the
fire. Then, while I am immersed in the sacred preliminary rites, do ye
prepare sweet-smelling woods and spices for the last act of parting.’

The children spread out what was left of the carpet. And, after all,
though this was just what they would have wished to have happened, all
hearts were sad. Then they put half a scuttle of coal on the fire and
went out, closing the door on the Phoenix--left, at last, alone with the
carpet.

‘One of us must keep watch,’ said Robert, excitedly, as soon as they
were all out of the room, ‘and the others can go and buy sweet woods and
spices. Get the very best that money can buy, and plenty of them.
Don’t let’s stand to a threepence or so. I want it to have a jolly good
send-off. It’s the only thing that’ll make us feel less horrid inside.’

It was felt that Robert, as the pet of the Phoenix, ought to have the
last melancholy pleasure of choosing the materials for its funeral pyre.

‘I’ll keep watch if you like,’ said Cyril. ‘I don’t mind. And, besides,
it’s raining hard, and my boots let in the wet. You might call and see
if my other ones are “really reliable” again yet.’

So they left Cyril, standing like a Roman sentinel outside the door
inside which the Phoenix was getting ready for the great change, and
they all went out to buy the precious things for the last sad rites.

‘Robert is right,’ Anthea said; ‘this is no time for being careful about
our money. Let’s go to the stationer’s first, and buy a whole packet of
lead-pencils. They’re cheaper if you buy them by the packet.’

This was a thing that they had always wanted to do, but it needed the
great excitement of a funeral pyre and a parting from a beloved Phoenix
to screw them up to the extravagance.

The people at the stationer’s said that the pencils were real
cedar-wood, so I hope they were, for stationers should always speak
the truth. At any rate they cost one-and-fourpence. Also they spent
sevenpence three-farthings on a little sandal-wood box inlaid with
ivory.

‘Because,’ said Anthea, ‘I know sandalwood smells sweet, and when it’s
burned it smells very sweet indeed.’

‘Ivory doesn’t smell at all,’ said Robert, ‘but I expect when you burn
it it smells most awful vile, like bones.’

At the grocer’s they bought all the spices they could remember the names
of--shell-like mace, cloves like blunt nails, peppercorns, the long
and the round kind; ginger, the dry sort, of course; and the beautiful
bloom-covered shells of fragrant cinnamon. Allspice too, and caraway
seeds (caraway seeds that smelt most deadly when the time came for
burning them).

Camphor and oil of lavender were bought at the chemist’s, and also a
little scent sachet labelled ‘Violettes de Parme’.

They took the things home and found Cyril still on guard. When they had
knocked and the golden voice of the Phoenix had said ‘Come in,’ they
went in.

There lay the carpet--or what was left of it--and on it lay an egg,
exactly like the one out of which the Phoenix had been hatched.

The Phoenix was walking round and round the egg, clucking with joy and
pride.

‘I’ve laid it, you see,’ it said, ‘and as fine an egg as ever I laid in
all my born days.’

Every one said yes, it was indeed a beauty.

The things which the children had bought were now taken out of their
papers and arranged on the table, and when the Phoenix had been
persuaded to leave its egg for a moment and look at the materials for
its last fire it was quite overcome.

‘Never, never have I had a finer pyre than this will be. You shall not
regret it,’ it said, wiping away a golden tear. ‘Write quickly: “Go and
tell the Psammead to fulfil the last wish of the Phoenix, and return
instantly”.’

But Robert wished to be polite and he wrote--

‘Please go and ask the Psammead to be so kind as to fulfil the Phoenix’s
last wish, and come straight back, if you please.’ The paper was pinned
to the carpet, which vanished and returned in the flash of an eye.

Then another paper was written ordering the carpet to take the egg
somewhere where it wouldn’t be hatched for another two thousand years.
The Phoenix tore itself away from its cherished egg, which it watched
with yearning tenderness till, the paper being pinned on, the carpet
hastily rolled itself up round the egg, and both vanished for ever from
the nursery of the house in Camden Town.

‘Oh, dear! oh, dear! oh, dear!’ said everybody.

‘Bear up,’ said the bird; ‘do you think _I_ don’t suffer, being parted
from my precious new-laid egg like this? Come, conquer your emotions and
build my fire.’

‘OH!’ cried Robert, suddenly, and wholly breaking down, ‘I can’t BEAR
you to go!’

The Phoenix perched on his shoulder and rubbed its beak softly against
his ear.

‘The sorrows of youth soon appear but as dreams,’ it said. ‘Farewell,
Robert of my heart. I have loved you well.’

The fire had burnt to a red glow. One by one the spices and sweet woods
were laid on it. Some smelt nice and some--the caraway seeds and the
Violettes de Parme sachet among them--smelt worse than you would think
possible.

‘Farewell, farewell, farewell, farewell!’ said the Phoenix, in a
far-away voice.

‘Oh, GOOD-BYE,’ said every one, and now all were in tears.

The bright bird fluttered seven times round the room and settled in the
hot heart of the fire. The sweet gums and spices and woods flared and
flickered around it, but its golden feathers did not burn. It seemed to
grow red-hot to the very inside heart of it--and then before the eight
eyes of its friends it fell together, a heap of white ashes, and the
flames of the cedar pencils and the sandal-wood box met and joined above
it.


‘Whatever have you done with the carpet?’ asked mother next day.

‘We gave it to some one who wanted it very much. The name began with a
P,’ said Jane.

The others instantly hushed her.

‘Oh, well, it wasn’t worth twopence,’ said mother.

‘The person who began with P said we shouldn’t lose by it,’ Jane went on
before she could be stopped.

‘I daresay!’ said mother, laughing.

But that very night a great box came, addressed to the children by all
their names. Eliza never could remember the name of the carrier who
brought it. It wasn’t Carter Paterson or the Parcels Delivery.

It was instantly opened. It was a big wooden box, and it had to
be opened with a hammer and the kitchen poker; the long nails came
squeaking out, and boards scrunched as they were wrenched off. Inside
the box was soft paper, with beautiful Chinese patterns on it--blue and
green and red and violet. And under the paper--well, almost everything
lovely that you can think of. Everything of reasonable size, I mean;
for, of course, there were no motors or flying machines or thoroughbred
chargers. But there really was almost everything else. Everything that
the children had always wanted--toys and games and books, and chocolate
and candied cherries and paint-boxes and photographic cameras, and all
the presents they had always wanted to give to father and mother and the
Lamb, only they had never had the money for them. At the very bottom
of the box was a tiny golden feather. No one saw it but Robert, and he
picked it up and hid it in the breast of his jacket, which had been
so often the nesting-place of the golden bird. When he went to bed the
feather was gone. It was the last he ever saw of the Phoenix.

Pinned to the lovely fur cloak that mother had always wanted was a
paper, and it said--

‘In return for the carpet. With gratitude.--P.’

You may guess how father and mother talked it over. They decided at
last the person who had had the carpet, and whom, curiously enough, the
children were quite unable to describe, must be an insane millionaire
who amused himself by playing at being a rag-and-bone man. But the
children knew better.

They knew that this was the fulfilment, by the powerful Psammead, of the
last wish of the Phoenix, and that this glorious and delightful boxful
of treasures was really the very, very, very end of the Phoenix and the
Carpet.

CHAPTER I.
THE PSAMMEAD


There were once four children who spent their summer holidays in a
white house, happily situated between a sandpit and a chalkpit. One day
they had the good fortune to find in the sandpit a strange creature.
Its eyes were on long horns like snail’s eyes, and it could move them
in and out like telescopes. It had ears like a bat’s ears, and its
tubby body was shaped like a spider’s and covered with thick soft
fur—and it had hands and feet like a monkey’s. It told the
children—whose names were Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane—that it was a
Psammead or sand-fairy. (Psammead is pronounced Sammy-ad.) It was old,
old, old, and its birthday was almost at the very beginning of
everything. And it had been buried in the sand for thousands of years.
But it still kept its fairylikeness, and part of this fairylikeness was
its power to give people whatever they wished for. You know fairies
have always been able to do this. Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane now
found their wishes come true; but, somehow, they never could think of
just the right things to wish for, and their wishes sometimes turned
out very oddly indeed. In the end their unwise wishings landed them in
what Robert called “a very tight place indeed”, and the Psammead
consented to help them out of it in return for their promise never
never to ask it to grant them any more wishes, and never to tell anyone
about it, because it did not want to be bothered to give wishes to
anyone ever any more. At the moment of parting Jane said politely—

“I wish we were going to see you again some day.”

And the Psammead, touched by this friendly thought, granted the wish.
The book about all this is called _Five Children and It_, and it ends
up in a most tiresome way by saying—

“The children _did_ see the Psammead again, but it was not in the
sandpit; it was—but I must say no more—”

The reason that nothing more could be said was that I had not then been
able to find out exactly when and where the children met the Psammead
again. Of course I knew they would meet it, because it was a beast of
its word, and when it said a thing would happen, that thing happened
without fail. How different from the people who tell us about what
weather it is going to be on Thursday next, in London, the South Coast,
and Channel!

The summer holidays during which the Psammead had been found and the
wishes given had been wonderful holidays in the country, and the
children had the highest hopes of just such another holiday for the
next summer. The winter holidays were beguiled by the wonderful
happenings of _The Phœnix and the Carpet_, and the loss of these two
treasures would have left the children in despair, but for the splendid
hope of their next holiday in the country. The world, they felt, and
indeed had some reason to feel, was full of wonderful things—and they
were really the sort of people that wonderful things happen to. So they
looked forward to the summer holiday; but when it came everything was
different, and very, very horrid. Father had to go out to Manchuria to
telegraph news about the war to the tiresome paper he wrote for—the
_Daily Bellower_, or something like that, was its name. And Mother,
poor dear Mother, was away in Madeira, because she had been very ill.
And The Lamb—I mean the baby—was with her. And Aunt Emma, who was
Mother’s sister, had suddenly married Uncle Reginald, who was Father’s
brother, and they had gone to China, which is much too far off for you
to expect to be asked to spend the holidays in, however fond your aunt
and uncle may be of you. So the children were left in the care of old
Nurse, who lived in Fitzroy Street, near the British Museum, and though
she was always very kind to them, and indeed spoiled them far more than
would be good for the most grown-up of us, the four children felt
perfectly wretched, and when the cab had driven off with Father and all
his boxes and guns and the sheepskin, with blankets and the aluminium
mess-kit inside it, the stoutest heart quailed, and the girls broke
down altogether, and sobbed in each other’s arms, while the boys each
looked out of one of the long gloomy windows of the parlour, and tried
to pretend that no boy would be such a muff as to cry.

I hope you notice that they were not cowardly enough to cry till their
Father had gone; they knew he had quite enough to upset him without
that. But when he was gone everyone felt as if it had been trying not
to cry all its life, and that it must cry now, if it died for it. So
they cried.

Tea—with shrimps and watercress—cheered them a little. The watercress
was arranged in a hedge round a fat glass salt-cellar, a tasteful
device they had never seen before. But it was not a cheerful meal.

After tea Anthea went up to the room that had been Father’s, and when
she saw how dreadfully he wasn’t there, and remembered how every minute
was taking him further and further from her, and nearer and nearer to
the guns of the Russians, she cried a little more. Then she thought of
Mother, ill and alone, and perhaps at that very moment wanting a little
girl to put eau-de-cologne on her head, and make her sudden cups of
tea, and she cried more than ever. And then she remembered what Mother
had said, the night before she went away, about Anthea being the eldest
girl, and about trying to make the others happy, and things like that.
So she stopped crying, and thought instead. And when she had thought as
long as she could bear she washed her face and combed her hair, and
went down to the others, trying her best to look as though crying were
an exercise she had never even heard of.

She found the parlour in deepest gloom, hardly relieved at all by the
efforts of Robert, who, to make the time pass, was pulling Jane’s
hair—not hard, but just enough to tease.

“Look here,” said Anthea. “Let’s have a palaver.” This word dated from
the awful day when Cyril had carelessly wished that there were Red
Indians in England—and there had been. The word brought back memories
of last summer holidays and everyone groaned; they thought of the white
house with the beautiful tangled garden—late roses, asters, marigold,
sweet mignonette, and feathery asparagus—of the wilderness which
someone had once meant to make into an orchard, but which was now, as
Father said, “five acres of thistles haunted by the ghosts of baby
cherry-trees”. They thought of the view across the valley, where the
lime-kilns looked like Aladdin’s palaces in the sunshine, and they
thought of their own sandpit, with its fringe of yellowy grasses and
pale-stringy-stalked wild flowers, and the little holes in the cliff
that were the little sand-martins’ little front doors. And they thought
of the free fresh air smelling of thyme and sweetbriar, and the scent
of the wood-smoke from the cottages in the lane—and they looked round
old Nurse’s stuffy parlour, and Jane said—

“Oh, how different it all is!”

It was. Old Nurse had been in the habit of letting lodgings, till
Father gave her the children to take care of. And her rooms were
furnished “for letting”. Now it is a very odd thing that no one ever
seems to furnish a room “for letting” in a bit the same way as one
would furnish it for living in. This room had heavy dark red stuff
curtains—the colour that blood would not make a stain on—with coarse
lace curtains inside. The carpet was yellow, and violet, with bits of
grey and brown oilcloth in odd places. The fireplace had shavings and
tinsel in it. There was a very varnished mahogany chiffonier, or
sideboard, with a lock that wouldn’t act. There were hard chairs—far
too many of them—with crochet antimacassars slipping off their seats,
all of which sloped the wrong way. The table wore a cloth of a cruel
green colour with a yellow chain-stitch pattern round it. Over the
fireplace was a looking-glass that made you look much uglier than you
really were, however plain you might be to begin with. Then there was a
mantelboard with maroon plush and wool fringe that did not match the
plush; a dreary clock like a black marble tomb—it was silent as the
grave too, for it had long since forgotten how to tick. And there were
painted glass vases that never had any flowers in, and a painted
tambourine that no one ever played, and painted brackets with nothing
on them.

“And maple-framed engravings of the Queen,
The Houses of Parliament, the Plains of Heaven,
And of a blunt-nosed woodman’s flat return.”


There were two books—last December’s _Bradshaw_, and an odd volume of
Plumridge’s _Commentary on Thessalonians_. There were—but I cannot
dwell longer on this painful picture. It was indeed, as Jane said, very
different.

“Let’s have a palaver,” said Anthea again.

“What about?” said Cyril, yawning.

“There’s nothing to have _anything_ about,” said Robert kicking the leg
of the table miserably.

“I don’t want to play,” said Jane, and her tone was grumpy.

Anthea tried very hard not to be cross. She succeeded.

“Look here,” she said, “don’t think I want to be preachy or a beast in
any way, but I want to what Father calls define the situation. Do you
agree?”

“Fire ahead,” said Cyril without enthusiasm.

“Well then. We all know the reason we’re staying here is because Nurse
couldn’t leave her house on account of the poor learned gentleman on
the top-floor. And there was no one else Father could entrust to take
care of us—and you know it’s taken a lot of money, Mother’s going to
Madeira to be made well.”

Jane sniffed miserably.

“Yes, I know,” said Anthea in a hurry, “but don’t let’s think about how
horrid it all is. I mean we can’t go to things that cost a lot, but we
must do _something_. And I know there are heaps of things you can see
in London without paying for them, and I thought we’d go and see them.
We are all quite old now, and we haven’t got The Lamb—”

Jane sniffed harder than before.

“I mean no one can say ‘No’ because of him, dear pet. And I thought we
_must_ get Nurse to see how quite old we are, and let us go out by
ourselves, or else we shall never have any sort of a time at all. And I
vote we see everything there is, and let’s begin by asking Nurse to
give us some bits of bread and we’ll go to St James’s Park. There are
ducks there, I know, we can feed them. Only we must make Nurse let us
go by ourselves.”

“Hurrah for liberty!” said Robert, “but she won’t.”

“Yes she will,” said Jane unexpectedly. “_I_ thought about that this
morning, and I asked Father, and he said yes; and what’s more he told
old Nurse we might, only he said we must always say where we wanted to
go, and if it was right she would let us.”

“Three cheers for thoughtful Jane,” cried Cyril, now roused at last
from his yawning despair. “I say, let’s go now.”

So they went, old Nurse only begging them to be careful of crossings,
and to ask a policeman to assist in the more difficult cases. But they
were used to crossings, for they had lived in Camden Town and knew the
Kentish Town Road where the trams rush up and down like mad at all
hours of the day and night, and seem as though, if anything, they would
rather run over you than not.

They had promised to be home by dark, but it was July, so dark would be
very late indeed, and long past bedtime.

They started to walk to St James’s Park, and all their pockets were
stuffed with bits of bread and the crusts of toast, to feed the ducks
with. They started, I repeat, but they never got there.

Between Fitzroy Street and St James’s Park there are a great many
streets, and, if you go the right way you will pass a great many shops
that you cannot possibly help stopping to look at. The children stopped
to look at several with gold-lace and beads and pictures and jewellery
and dresses, and hats, and oysters and lobsters in their windows, and
their sorrow did not seem nearly so impossible to bear as it had done
in the best parlour at No. 300, Fitzroy Street.

Presently, by some wonderful chance turn of Robert’s (who had been
voted Captain because the girls thought it would be good for him—and
indeed he thought so himself—and of course Cyril couldn’t vote against
him because it would have looked like a mean jealousy), they came into
the little interesting criss-crossy streets that held the most
interesting shops of all—the shops where live things were sold. There
was one shop window entirely filled with cages, and all sorts of
beautiful birds in them. The children were delighted till they
remembered how they had once wished for wings themselves, and had had
them—and then they felt how desperately unhappy anything with wings
must be if it is shut up in a cage and not allowed to fly.

“It must be fairly beastly to be a bird in a cage,” said Cyril. “Come
on!”

They went on, and Cyril tried to think out a scheme for making his
fortune as a gold-digger at Klondyke, and then buying all the caged
birds in the world and setting them free. Then they came to a shop that
sold cats, but the cats were in cages, and the children could not help
wishing someone would buy all the cats and put them on hearthrugs,
which are the proper places for cats. And there was the dog-shop, and
that was not a happy thing to look at either, because all the dogs were
chained or caged, and all the dogs, big and little, looked at the four
children with sad wistful eyes and wagged beseeching tails as if they
were trying to say, “Buy me! buy me! buy me! and let me go for a walk
with you; oh, do buy me, and buy my poor brothers too! Do! do! do!”
They almost said, “Do! do! do!” plain to the ear, as they whined; all
but one big Irish terrier, and he growled when Jane patted him.

“Grrrrr,” he seemed to say, as he looked at them from the back corner
of his eye—“_You_ won’t buy me. Nobody will—ever—I shall die chained
up—and I don’t know that I care how soon it is, either!”

I don’t know that the children would have understood all this, only
once they had been in a besieged castle, so they knew how hateful it is
to be kept in when you want to get out.

Of course they could not buy any of the dogs. They did, indeed, ask the
price of the very, very smallest, and it was sixty-five pounds—but that
was because it was a Japanese toy spaniel like the Queen once had her
portrait painted with, when she was only Princess of Wales. But the
children thought, if the smallest was all that money, the biggest would
run into thousands—so they went on.

And they did not stop at any more cat or dog or bird shops, but passed
them by, and at last they came to a shop that seemed as though it only
sold creatures that did not much mind where they were—such as goldfish
and white mice, and sea-anemones and other aquarium beasts, and lizards
and toads, and hedgehogs and tortoises, and tame rabbits and
guinea-pigs. And there they stopped for a long time, and fed the
guinea-pigs with bits of bread through the cage-bars, and wondered
whether it would be possible to keep a sandy-coloured double-lop in the
basement of the house in Fitzroy Street.

“I don’t suppose old Nurse would mind _very_ much,” said Jane. “Rabbits
are most awfully tame sometimes. I expect it would know her voice and
follow her all about.”

“She’d tumble over it twenty times a day,” said Cyril; “now a snake—”

“There aren’t any snakes,” said Robert hastily, “and besides, I never
could cotton to snakes somehow—I wonder why.”

“Worms are as bad,” said Anthea, “and eels and slugs—I think it’s
because we don’t like things that haven’t got legs.”

“Father says snakes have got legs hidden away inside of them,” said
Robert.

“Yes—and he says _we’ve_ got tails hidden away inside _us_—but it
doesn’t either of it come to anything _really_,” said Anthea. “I hate
things that haven’t any legs.”

“It’s worse when they have too many,” said Jane with a shudder, “think
of centipedes!”

They stood there on the pavement, a cause of some inconvenience to the
passersby, and thus beguiled the time with conversation. Cyril was
leaning his elbow on the top of a hutch that had seemed empty when they
had inspected the whole edifice of hutches one by one, and he was
trying to reawaken the interest of a hedgehog that had curled itself
into a ball earlier in the interview, when a small, soft voice just
below his elbow said, quietly, plainly and quite unmistakably—not in
any squeak or whine that had to be translated—but in downright common
English—

“Buy me—do—please buy me!”

Cyril started as though he had been pinched, and jumped a yard away
from the hutch.

“Come back—oh, come back!” said the voice, rather louder but still
softly; “stoop down and pretend to be tying up your bootlace—I see it’s
undone, as usual.”

Cyril mechanically obeyed. He knelt on one knee on the dry, hot dusty
pavement, peered into the darkness of the hutch and found himself face
to face with—the Psammead!

It seemed much thinner than when he had last seen it. It was dusty and
dirty, and its fur was untidy and ragged. It had hunched itself up into
a miserable lump, and its long snail’s eyes were drawn in quite tight
so that they hardly showed at all.

“Listen,” said the Psammead, in a voice that sounded as though it would
begin to cry in a minute, “I don’t think the creature who keeps this
shop will ask a very high price for me. I’ve bitten him more than once,
and I’ve made myself look as common as I can. He’s never had a glance
from my beautiful, beautiful eyes. Tell the others I’m here—but tell
them to look at some of those low, common beasts while I’m talking to
you. The creature inside mustn’t think you care much about me, or he’ll
put a price upon me far, far beyond your means. I remember in the dear
old days last summer you never had much money. Oh—I never thought I
should be so glad to see you—I never did.” It sniffed, and shot out its
long snail’s eyes expressly to drop a tear well away from its fur.
“Tell the others I’m here, and then I’ll tell you exactly what to do
about buying me.”

Cyril tied his bootlace into a hard knot, stood up and addressed the
others in firm tones—

“Look here,” he said, “I’m not kidding—and I appeal to your honour,” an
appeal which in this family was never made in vain. “Don’t look at that
hutch—look at the white rat. Now you are not to look at that hutch
whatever I say.”

He stood in front of it to prevent mistakes.

“Now get yourselves ready for a great surprise. In that hutch there’s
an old friend of ours—_don’t_ look!—Yes; it’s the Psammead, the good
old Psammead! it wants us to buy it. It says you’re not to look at it.
Look at the white rat and count your money! On your honour don’t look!”

The others responded nobly. They looked at the white rat till they
quite stared him out of countenance, so that he went and sat up on his
hind legs in a far corner and hid his eyes with his front paws, and
pretended he was washing his face.

Cyril stooped again, busying himself with the other bootlace and
listened for the Psammead’s further instructions.

“Go in,” said the Psammead, “and ask the price of lots of other things.
Then say, ‘What do you want for that monkey that’s lost its tail—the
mangy old thing in the third hutch from the end.’ Oh—don’t mind _my_
feelings—call me a mangy monkey—I’ve tried hard enough to look like
one! I don’t think he’ll put a high price on me—I’ve bitten him eleven
times since I came here the day before yesterday. If he names a bigger
price than you can afford, say you wish you had the money.”

“But you can’t give us wishes. I’ve promised never to have another wish
from you,” said the bewildered Cyril.

“Don’t be a silly little idiot,” said the Sand-fairy in trembling but
affectionate tones, “but find out how much money you’ve got between
you, and do exactly what I tell you.”

Cyril, pointing a stiff and unmeaning finger at the white rat, so as to
pretend that its charms alone employed his tongue, explained matters to
the others, while the Psammead hunched itself, and bunched itself, and
did its very best to make itself look uninteresting.

Then the four children filed into the shop.

“How much do you want for that white rat?” asked Cyril.

“Eightpence,” was the answer.

“And the guinea-pigs?”

“Eighteenpence to five bob, according to the breed.”

“And the lizards?”

“Ninepence each.”

“And toads?”

“Fourpence. Now look here,” said the greasy owner of all this caged
life with a sudden ferocity which made the whole party back hurriedly
on to the wainscoting of hutches with which the shop was lined. “Lookee
here. I ain’t agoin’ to have you a comin’ in here a turnin’ the whole
place outer winder, an’ prizing every animile in the stock just for
your larks, so don’t think it! If you’re a buyer, _be_ a buyer—but I
never had a customer yet as wanted to buy mice, and lizards, and toads,
and guineas all at once. So hout you goes.”

“Oh! wait a minute,” said the wretched Cyril, feeling how foolishly yet
well-meaningly he had carried out the Psammead’s instructions. “Just
tell me one thing. What do you want for the mangy old monkey in the
third hutch from the end?”

The shopman only saw in this a new insult.

“Mangy young monkey yourself,” said he; “get along with your blooming
cheek. Hout you goes!”

“Oh! don’t be so cross,” said Jane, losing her head altogether, “don’t
you see he really _does_ want to know _that!_”

“Ho! does ’e indeed,” sneered the merchant. Then he scratched his ear
suspiciously, for he was a sharp business man, and he knew the ring of
truth when he heard it. His hand was bandaged, and three minutes before
he would have been glad to sell the “mangy old monkey” for ten
shillings. Now—

“Ho! ’E does, does ’e,” he said, “then two pun ten’s my price. He’s not
got his fellow that monkey ain’t, nor yet his match, not this side of
the equator, which he comes from. And the only one ever seen in London.
Ought to be in the Zoo. Two pun ten, down on the nail, or _hout_ you
goes!”

The children looked at each other—twenty-three shillings and fivepence
was all they had in the world, and it would have been merely three and
fivepence, but for the sovereign which Father had given to them
“between them” at parting.

“We’ve only twenty-three shillings and fivepence,” said Cyril, rattling
the money in his pocket.

“Twenty-three farthings and somebody’s own cheek,” said the dealer, for
he did not believe that Cyril had so much money.

There was a miserable pause. Then Anthea remembered, and said—

“Oh! I _wish_ I had two pounds ten.”

“So do I, Miss, I’m sure,” said the man with bitter politeness; “I wish
you “ad, I’m sure!”

Anthea’s hand was on the counter, something seemed to slide under it.
She lifted it. There lay five bright half sovereigns.

“Why, I _have_ got it after all,” she said; “here’s the money, now
let’s have the Sammy,... the monkey I mean.”

The dealer looked hard at the money, but he made haste to put it in his
pocket.

“I only hope you come by it honest,” he said, shrugging his shoulders.
He scratched his ear again.

“Well!” he said, “I suppose I must let you have it, but it’s worth
thribble the money, so it is—”

He slowly led the way out to the hutch—opened the door gingerly, and
made a sudden fierce grab at the Psammead, which the Psammead
acknowledged in one last long lingering bite.

“Here, take the brute,” said the shopman, squeezing the Psammead so
tight that he nearly choked it. “It’s bit me to the marrow, it have.”

The man’s eyes opened as Anthea held out her arms. “Don’t blame me if
it tears your face off its bones,” he said, and the Psammead made a
leap from his dirty horny hands, and Anthea caught it in hers, which
were not very clean, certainly, but at any rate were soft and pink, and
held it kindly and closely.

“But you can’t take it home like that,” Cyril said, “we shall have a
crowd after us,” and indeed two errand boys and a policeman had already
collected.

“I can’t give you nothink only a paper-bag, like what we put the
tortoises in,” said the man grudgingly.

So the whole party went into the shop, and the shopman’s eyes nearly
came out of his head when, having given Anthea the largest paper-bag he
could find, he saw her hold it open, and the Psammead carefully creep
into it.

“Well!” he said, “if that there don’t beat cockfighting! But p’raps
you’ve met the brute afore.”

“Yes,” said Cyril affably, “he’s an old friend of ours.”

“If I’d a known that,” the man rejoined, “you shouldn’t a had him under
twice the money. ’Owever,” he added, as the children disappeared, “I
ain’t done so bad, seeing as I only give five bob for the beast. But
then there’s the bites to take into account!”

The children trembling in agitation and excitement, carried home the
Psammead, trembling in its paper-bag.

When they got it home, Anthea nursed it, and stroked it, and would have
cried over it, if she hadn’t remembered how it hated to be wet.

When it recovered enough to speak, it said—

“Get me sand; silver sand from the oil and colour shop. And get me
plenty.”

They got the sand, and they put it and the Psammead in the round bath
together, and it rubbed itself, and rolled itself, and shook itself and
scraped itself, and scratched itself, and preened itself, till it felt
clean and comfy, and then it scrabbled a hasty hole in the sand, and
went to sleep in it.

The children hid the bath under the girls’ bed, and had supper. Old
Nurse had got them a lovely supper of bread and butter and fried
onions. She was full of kind and delicate thoughts.

When Anthea woke the next morning, the Psammead was snuggling down
between her shoulder and Jane’s.

“You have saved my life,” it said. “I know that man would have thrown
cold water on me sooner or later, and then I should have died. I saw
him wash out a guinea-pig’s hutch yesterday morning. I’m still
frightfully sleepy, I think I’ll go back to sand for another nap. Wake
the boys and this dormouse of a Jane, and when you’ve had your
breakfasts we’ll have a talk.”

“Don’t _you_ want any breakfast?” asked Anthea.

“I daresay I shall pick a bit presently,” it said; “but sand is all I
care about—it’s meat and drink to me, and coals and fire and wife and
children.” With these words it clambered down by the bedclothes and
scrambled back into the bath, where they heard it scratching itself out
of sight.

“Well!” said Anthea, “anyhow our holidays won’t be dull _now_. We’ve
found the Psammead again.”

“No,” said Jane, beginning to put on her stockings. “We shan’t be
_dull_—but it’ll be only like having a pet dog now it can’t give us
wishes.”

“Oh, don’t be so discontented,” said Anthea. “If it can’t do anything
else it can tell us about Megatheriums and things.”




CHAPTER II.
THE HALF AMULET


Long ago—that is to say last summer—the children, finding themselves
embarrassed by some wish which the Psammead had granted them, and which
the servants had not received in a proper spirit, had wished that the
servants might not notice the gifts which the Psammead gave. And when
they parted from the Psammead their last wish had been that they should
meet it again. Therefore they _had_ met it (and it was jolly lucky for
the Psammead, as Robert pointed out). Now, of course, you see that the
Psammead’s being where it was, was the consequence of one of their
wishes, and therefore was a Psammead-wish, and as such could not be
noticed by the servants. And it was soon plain that in the Psammead’s
opinion old Nurse was still a servant, although she had now a house of
her own, for she never noticed the Psammead at all. And that was as
well, for she would never have consented to allow the girls to keep an
animal and a bath of sand under their bed.

When breakfast had been cleared away—it was a very nice breakfast with
hot rolls to it, a luxury quite out of the common way—Anthea went and
dragged out the bath, and woke the Psammead. It stretched and shook
itself.

“You must have bolted your breakfast most unwholesomely,” it said, “you
can’t have been five minutes over it.”

“We’ve been nearly an hour,” said Anthea. “Come—you know you promised.”

“Now look here,” said the Psammead, sitting back on the sand and
shooting out its long eyes suddenly, “we’d better begin as we mean to
go on. It won’t do to have any misunderstanding, so I tell you plainly
that—”

“Oh, _please_,” Anthea pleaded, “do wait till we get to the others.
They’ll think it most awfully sneakish of me to talk to you without
them; do come down, there’s a dear.”

She knelt before the sand-bath and held out her arms. The Psammead must
have remembered how glad it had been to jump into those same little
arms only the day before, for it gave a little grudging grunt, and
jumped once more.

Anthea wrapped it in her pinafore and carried it downstairs. It was
welcomed in a thrilling silence.

At last Anthea said, “Now then!”

“What place is this?” asked the Psammead, shooting its eyes out and
turning them slowly round.

“It’s a sitting-room, of course,” said Robert.

“Then I don’t like it,” said the Psammead.

“Never mind,” said Anthea kindly; “we’ll take you anywhere you like if
you want us to. What was it you were going to say upstairs when I said
the others wouldn’t like it if I stayed talking to you without them?”

It looked keenly at her, and she blushed.

“Don’t be silly,” it said sharply. “Of course, it’s quite natural that
you should like your brothers and sisters to know exactly how good and
unselfish you were.”

“I wish you wouldn’t,” said Jane. “Anthea was quite right. What was it
you were going to say when she stopped you?”

“I’ll tell you,” said the Psammead, “since you’re so anxious to know. I
was going to say this. You’ve saved my life—and I’m not ungrateful—but
it doesn’t change your nature or mine. You’re still very ignorant, and
rather silly, and I am worth a thousand of you any day of the week.”

“Of course you are!” Anthea was beginning but it interrupted her.

“It’s very rude to interrupt,” it said; “what I mean is that I’m not
going to stand any nonsense, and if you think what you’ve done is to
give you the right to pet me or make me demean myself by playing with
you, you’ll find out that what you think doesn’t matter a single penny.
See? It’s what _I_ think that matters.”

“I know,” said Cyril, “it always was, if you remember.”

“Well,” said the Psammead, “then that’s settled. We’re to be treated as
we deserve. I with respect, and all of you with—but I don’t wish to be
offensive. Do you want me to tell you how I got into that horrible den
you bought me out of? Oh, I’m not ungrateful! I haven’t forgotten it
and I shan’t forget it.”

“Do tell us,” said Anthea. “I know you’re awfully clever, but even with
all your cleverness, I don’t believe you can possibly know how—how
respectfully we do respect you. Don’t we?”

The others all said yes—and fidgeted in their chairs. Robert spoke the
wishes of all when he said—

“I do wish you’d go on.” So it sat up on the green-covered table and
went on.

“When you’d gone away,” it said, “I went to sand for a bit, and slept.
I was tired out with all your silly wishes, and I felt as though I
hadn’t really been to sand for a year.”

“To sand?” Jane repeated.

“Where I sleep. You go to bed. I go to sand.”

Jane yawned; the mention of bed made her feel sleepy.

“All right,” said the Psammead, in offended tones. “I’m sure _I_ don’t
want to tell you a long tale. A man caught me, and I bit him. And he
put me in a bag with a dead hare and a dead rabbit. And he took me to
his house and put me out of the bag into a basket with holes that I
could see through. And I bit him again. And then he brought me to this
city, which I am told is called the Modern Babylon—though it’s not a
bit like the old Babylon—and he sold me to the man you bought me from,
and then I bit them both. Now, what’s your news?”

“There’s not quite so much biting in our story,” said Cyril
regretfully; “in fact, there isn’t any. Father’s gone to Manchuria, and
Mother and The Lamb have gone to Madeira because Mother was ill, and
don’t I just wish that they were both safe home again.”

Merely from habit, the Sand-fairy began to blow itself out, but it
stopped short suddenly.

“I forgot,” it said; “I can’t give you any more wishes.”

“No—but look here,” said Cyril, “couldn’t we call in old Nurse and get
her to say _she_ wishes they were safe home. I’m sure she does.”

“No go,” said the Psammead. “It’s just the same as your wishing
yourself if you get some one else to wish for you. It won’t act.”

“But it did yesterday—with the man in the shop,” said Robert.

“Ah yes,” said the creature, “but you didn’t _ask_ him to wish, and you
didn’t know what would happen if he did. That can’t be done again. It’s
played out.”

“Then you can’t help us at all,” said Jane; “oh—I did think you could
do something; I’ve been thinking about it ever since we saved your life
yesterday. I thought you’d be certain to be able to fetch back Father,
even if you couldn’t manage Mother.”

And Jane began to cry.

“Now _don’t_,” said the Psammead hastily; “you know how it always
upsets me if you cry. I can’t feel safe a moment. Look here; you must
have some new kind of charm.”

“That’s easier said than done.”

“Not a bit of it,” said the creature; “there’s one of the strongest
charms in the world not a stone’s throw from where you bought me
yesterday. The man that I bit so—the first one, I mean—went into a shop
to ask how much something cost—I think he said it was a concertina—and
while he was telling the man in the shop how much too much he wanted
for it, I saw the charm in a sort of tray, with a lot of other things.
If you can only buy _that_, you will be able to have your heart’s
desire.”

The children looked at each other and then at the Psammead. Then Cyril
coughed awkwardly and took sudden courage to say what everyone was
thinking.

“I do hope you won’t be waxy,” he said; “but it’s like this: when you
used to give us our wishes they almost always got us into some row or
other, and we used to think you wouldn’t have been pleased if they
hadn’t. Now, about this charm—we haven’t got over and above too much
tin, and if we blue it all on this charm and it turns out to be not up
to much—well—you see what I’m driving at, don’t you?”

“I see that _you_ don’t see more than the length of your nose, and
_that’s_ not far,” said the Psammead crossly. “Look here, I _had_ to
give you the wishes, and of course they turned out badly, in a sort of
way, because you hadn’t the sense to wish for what was good for you.
But this charm’s quite different. I haven’t _got_ to do this for you,
it’s just my own generous kindness that makes me tell you about it. So
it’s bound to be all right. See?”

“Don’t be cross,” said Anthea, “Please, _please_ don’t. You see, it’s
all we’ve got; we shan’t have any more pocket-money till Daddy comes
home—unless he sends us some in a letter. But we _do_ trust you. And I
say all of you,” she went on, “don’t you think it’s worth spending
_all_ the money, if there’s even the chanciest chance of getting Father
and Mother back safe _now?_ Just think of it! Oh, do let’s!”

“_I_ don’t care what you do,” said the Psammead; “I’ll go back to sand
again till you’ve made up your minds.”

“No, don’t!” said everybody; and Jane added, “We are quite mind
made-up—don’t you see we are? Let’s get our hats. Will you come with
us?”

“Of course,” said the Psammead; “how else would you find the shop?”

So everybody got its hat. The Psammead was put into a flat bass-bag
that had come from Farringdon Market with two pounds of filleted plaice
in it. Now it contained about three pounds and a quarter of solid
Psammead, and the children took it in turns to carry it.

“It’s not half the weight of The Lamb,” Robert said, and the girls
sighed.

The Psammead poked a wary eye out of the top of the basket every now
and then, and told the children which turnings to take.

“How on earth do you know?” asked Robert. “I can’t think how you do
it.”

And the Psammead said sharply, “No—I don’t suppose you can.”

At last they came to _the_ shop. It had all sorts and kinds of things
in the window—concertinas, and silk handkerchiefs, china vases and
tea-cups, blue Japanese jars, pipes, swords, pistols, lace collars,
silver spoons tied up in half-dozens, and wedding-rings in a red
lacquered basin. There were officers’ epaulets and doctors’ lancets.
There were tea-caddies inlaid with red turtle-shell and brass
curly-wurlies, plates of different kinds of money, and stacks of
different kinds of plates. There was a beautiful picture of a little
girl washing a dog, which Jane liked very much. And in the middle of
the window there was a dirty silver tray full of mother-of-pearl card
counters, old seals, paste buckles, snuff-boxes, and all sorts of
little dingy odds and ends.

The Psammead put its head quite out of the fish-basket to look in the
window, when Cyril said—

“There’s a tray there with rubbish in it.”

And then its long snail’s eyes saw something that made them stretch out
so much that they were as long and thin as new slate-pencils. Its fur
bristled thickly, and its voice was quite hoarse with excitement as it
whispered—

“That’s it! That’s it! There, under that blue and yellow buckle, you
can see a bit sticking out. It’s red. Do you see?”

“Is it that thing something like a horse-shoe?” asked Cyril. “And red,
like the common sealing-wax you do up parcels with?”

“Yes, that’s it,” said the Psammead. “Now, you do just as you did
before. Ask the price of other things. That blue buckle would do. Then
the man will get the tray out of the window. I think you’d better be
the one,” it said to Anthea. “We’ll wait out here.”

So the others flattened their noses against the shop window, and
presently a large, dirty, short-fingered hand with a very big diamond
ring came stretching through the green half-curtains at the back of the
shop window and took away the tray.

They could not see what was happening in the interview between Anthea
and the Diamond Ring, and it seemed to them that she had had time—if
she had had money—to buy everything in the shop before the moment came
when she stood before them, her face wreathed in grins, as Cyril said
later, and in her hand the charm.

It was something like this:

[Illustration]

and it was made of a red, smooth, softly shiny stone.

“I’ve got it,” Anthea whispered, just opening her hand to give the
others a glimpse of it. “Do let’s get home. We can’t stand here like
stuck-pigs looking at it in the street.”

So home they went. The parlour in Fitzroy Street was a very flat
background to magic happenings. Down in the country among the flowers
and green fields anything had seemed—and indeed had been—possible. But
it was hard to believe that anything really wonderful could happen so
near the Tottenham Court Road. But the Psammead was there—and it in
itself was wonderful. And it could talk—and it had shown them where a
charm could be bought that would make the owner of it perfectly happy.
So the four children hurried home, taking very long steps, with their
chins stuck out, and their mouths shut very tight indeed. They went so
fast that the Psammead was quite shaken about in its fish-bag, but it
did not say anything—perhaps for fear of attracting public notice.

They got home at last, very hot indeed, and set the Psammead on the
green tablecloth.

“Now then!” said Cyril.

But the Psammead had to have a plate of sand fetched for it, for it was
quite faint. When it had refreshed itself a little it said—

“Now then! Let me see the charm,” and Anthea laid it on the green
table-cover. The Psammead shot out his long eyes to look at it, then it
turned them reproachfully on Anthea and said—

“But there’s only half of it here!”

This was indeed a blow.

“It was all there was,” said Anthea, with timid firmness. She knew it
was not her fault.

“There should be another piece,” said the Psammead, “and a sort of pin
to fasten the two together.”

“Isn’t half any good?”—“Won’t it work without the other bit?”—“It cost
seven-and-six.”—“Oh, bother, bother, bother!”—“Don’t be silly little
idiots!” said everyone and the Psammead altogether.

Then there was a wretched silence. Cyril broke it—

“What shall we do?”

“Go back to the shop and see if they haven’t got the other half,” said
the Psammead. “I’ll go to sand till you come back. Cheer up! Even the
bit you’ve got is _some_ good, but it’ll be no end of a bother if you
can’t find the other.”

So Cyril went to the shop. And the Psammead to sand. And the other
three went to dinner, which was now ready. And old Nurse was very cross
that Cyril was not ready too.

The three were watching at the windows when Cyril returned, and even
before he was near enough for them to see his face there was something
about the slouch of his shoulders and set of his knickerbockers and the
way he dragged his boots along that showed but too plainly that his
errand had been in vain.

“Well?” they all said, hoping against hope on the front-door step.

“No go,” Cyril answered; “the man said the thing was perfect. He said
it was a Roman lady’s locket, and people shouldn’t buy curios if they
didn’t know anything about arky—something or other, and that he never
went back on a bargain, because it wasn’t business, and he expected his
customers to act the same. He was simply nasty—that’s what he was, and
I want my dinner.”

It was plain that Cyril was not pleased.

The unlikeliness of anything really interesting happening in that
parlour lay like a weight of lead on everyone’s spirits. Cyril had his
dinner, and just as he was swallowing the last mouthful of
apple-pudding there was a scratch at the door. Anthea opened it and in
walked the Psammead.

“Well,” it said, when it had heard the news, “things might be worse.
Only you won’t be surprised if you have a few adventures before you get
the other half. You want to get it, of course.”

“Rather,” was the general reply. “And we don’t mind adventures.”

“No,” said the Psammead, “I seem to remember that about you. Well, sit
down and listen with all your ears. Eight, are there? Right—I am glad
you know arithmetic. Now pay attention, because I don’t intend to tell
you everything twice over.”

As the children settled themselves on the floor—it was far more
comfortable than the chairs, as well as more polite to the Psammead,
who was stroking its whiskers on the hearth-rug—a sudden cold pain
caught at Anthea’s heart. Father—Mother—the darling Lamb—all far away.
Then a warm, comfortable feeling flowed through her. The Psammead was
here, and at least half a charm, and there were to be adventures. (If
you don’t know what a cold pain is, I am glad for your sakes, and I
hope you never may.)

“Now,” said the Psammead cheerily, “you are not particularly nice, nor
particularly clever, and you’re not at all good-looking. Still, you’ve
saved my life—oh, when I think of that man and his pail of water!—so
I’ll tell you all I know. At least, of course I can’t do that, because
I know far too much. But I’ll tell you all I know about this red
thing.”

“Do! Do! Do! Do!” said everyone.

“Well, then,” said the Psammead. “This thing is half of an Amulet that
can do all sorts of things; it can make the corn grow, and the waters
flow, and the trees bear fruit, and the little new beautiful babies
come. (Not that babies _are_ beautiful, of course,” it broke off to
say, “but their mothers think they are—and as long as you think a
thing’s true it _is_ true as far as you’re concerned.)”

Robert yawned.

The Psammead went on.

“The complete Amulet can keep off all the things that make people
unhappy—jealousy, bad temper, pride, disagreeableness, greediness,
selfishness, laziness. Evil spirits, people called them when the Amulet
was made. Don’t you think it would be nice to have it?”

“Very,” said the children, quite without enthusiasm.

“And it can give you strength and courage.”

“That’s better,” said Cyril.

“And virtue.”

“I suppose it’s nice to have that,” said Jane, but not with much
interest.

“And it can give you your heart’s desire.”

“Now you’re talking,” said Robert.

“Of course I am,” retorted the Psammead tartly, “so there’s no need for
you to.”

“Heart’s desire is good enough for me,” said Cyril.

“Yes, but,” Anthea ventured, “all that’s what the _whole_ charm can do.
There’s something that the half we’ve got can win off its own bat—isn’t
there?” She appealed to the Psammead. It nodded.

“Yes,” it said; “the half has the power to take you anywhere you like
to look for the other half.”

This seemed a brilliant prospect till Robert asked—

“Does it know where to look?”

The Psammead shook its head and answered, “I don’t think it’s likely.”

“Do you?”

“No.”

“Then,” said Robert, “we might as well look for a needle in a bottle of
hay. Yes—it _is_ bottle, and not bundle, Father said so.”

“Not at all,” said the Psammead briskly-, “you think you know
everything, but you are quite mistaken. The first thing is to get the
thing to talk.”

“Can it?” Jane questioned. Jane’s question did not mean that she
thought it couldn’t, for in spite of the parlour furniture the feeling
of magic was growing deeper and thicker, and seemed to fill the room
like a dream of a scented fog.

“Of course it can. I suppose you can read.”

“Oh yes!” Everyone was rather hurt at the question.

“Well, then—all you’ve got to do is to read the name that’s written on
the part of the charm that you’ve got. And as soon as you say the name
out loud the thing will have power to do—well, several things.”

There was a silence. The red charm was passed from hand to hand.

“There’s no name on it,” said Cyril at last.

“Nonsense,” said the Psammead; “what’s that?”

“Oh, _that!_” said Cyril, “it’s not reading. It looks like pictures of
chickens and snakes and things.”

This was what was on the charm:

[Illustration]

“I’ve no patience with you,” said the Psammead; “if you can’t read you
must find some one who can. A priest now?”

“We don’t know any priests,” said Anthea; “we know a clergyman—he’s
called a priest in the prayer-book, you know—but he only knows Greek
and Latin and Hebrew, and this isn’t any of those—I know.”

The Psammead stamped a furry foot angrily.

“I wish I’d never seen you,” it said; “you aren’t any more good than so
many stone images. Not so much, if I’m to tell the truth. Is there no
wise man in your Babylon who can pronounce the names of the Great
Ones?”

“There’s a poor learned gentleman upstairs,” said Anthea, “we might try
him. He has a lot of stone images in his room, and iron-looking ones
too—we peeped in once when he was out. Old Nurse says he doesn’t eat
enough to keep a canary alive. He spends it all on stones and things.”

“Try him,” said the Psammead, “only be careful. If he knows a greater
name than this and uses it against you, your charm will be of no use.
Bind him first with the chains of honour and upright dealing. And then
ask his aid—oh, yes, you’d better all go; you can put me to sand as you
go upstairs. I must have a few minutes’ peace and quietness.”

So the four children hastily washed their hands and brushed their
hair—this was Anthea’s idea—and went up to knock at the door of the
“poor learned gentleman”, and to “bind him with the chains of honour
and upright dealing”.




CHAPTER III.
THE PAST


The learned gentleman had let his dinner get quite cold. It was mutton
chop, and as it lay on the plate it looked like a brown island in the
middle of a frozen pond, because the grease of the gravy had become
cold, and consequently white. It looked very nasty, and it was the
first thing the children saw when, after knocking three times and
receiving no reply, one of them ventured to turn the handle and softly
to open the door. The chop was on the end of a long table that ran down
one side of the room. The table had images on it and queer-shaped
stones, and books. And there were glass cases fixed against the wall
behind, with little strange things in them. The cases were rather like
the ones you see in jewellers’ shops.

The “poor learned gentleman” was sitting at a table in the window,
looking at something very small which he held in a pair of fine
pincers. He had a round spy-glass sort of thing in one eye—which
reminded the children of watchmakers, and also of the long snail’s eyes
of the Psammead.

The gentleman was very long and thin, and his long, thin boots stuck
out under the other side of his table. He did not hear the door open,
and the children stood hesitating. At last Robert gave the door a push,
and they all started back, for in the middle of the wall that the door
had hidden was a mummy-case—very, very, very big—painted in red and
yellow and green and black, and the face of it seemed to look at them
quite angrily.

You know what a mummy-case is like, of course? If you don’t you had
better go to the British Museum at once and find out. Anyway, it is not
at all the sort of thing that you expect to meet in a top-floor front
in Bloomsbury, looking as though it would like to know what business
_you_ had there.

So everyone said, “Oh!” rather loud, and their boots clattered as they
stumbled back.

The learned gentleman took the glass out of his eye and said—“I beg
your pardon,” in a very soft, quiet pleasant voice—the voice of a
gentleman who has been to Oxford.

“It’s us that beg yours,” said Cyril politely. “We are sorry to disturb
you.”

“Come in,” said the gentleman, rising—with the most distinguished
courtesy, Anthea told herself. “I am delighted to see you. Won’t you
sit down? No, not there; allow me to move that papyrus.”

He cleared a chair, and stood smiling and looking kindly through his
large, round spectacles.

“He treats us like grown-ups,” whispered Robert, “and he doesn’t seem
to know how many of us there are.”

“Hush,” said Anthea, “it isn’t manners to whisper. You say, Cyril—go
ahead.”

“We’re very sorry to disturb you,” said Cyril politely, “but we did
knock three times, and you didn’t say ‘Come in’, or ‘Run away now’, or
that you couldn’t be bothered just now, or to come when you weren’t so
busy, or any of the things people do say when you knock at doors, so we
opened it. We knew you were in because we heard you sneeze while we
were waiting.”

“Not at all,” said the gentleman; “do sit down.”

“He has found out there are four of us,” said Robert, as the gentleman
cleared three more chairs. He put the things off them carefully on the
floor. The first chair had things like bricks that tiny, tiny birds’
feet have walked over when the bricks were soft, only the marks were in
regular lines. The second chair had round things on it like very large,
fat, long, pale beads. And the last chair had a pile of dusty papers on
it.

The children sat down.

“We know you are very, very learned,” said Cyril, “and we have got a
charm, and we want you to read the name on it, because it isn’t in
Latin or Greek, or Hebrew, or any of the languages _we_ know—”

“A thorough knowledge of even those languages is a very fair foundation
on which to build an education,” said the gentleman politely.

“Oh!” said Cyril blushing, “but we only know them to look at, except
Latin—and I’m only in Caesar with that.”

The gentleman took off his spectacles and laughed. His laugh sounded
rusty, Cyril thought, as though it wasn’t often used.

“Of course!” he said. “I’m sure I beg your pardon. I think I must have
been in a dream. You are the children who live downstairs, are you not?
Yes. I have seen you as I have passed in and out. And you have found
something that you think to be an antiquity, and you’ve brought it to
show me? That was very kind. I should like to inspect it.”

“I’m afraid we didn’t think about your liking to inspect it,” said the
truthful Anthea. “It was just for _us_—because we wanted to know the
name on it—”

“Oh, yes—and, I say,” Robert interjected, “you won’t think it rude of
us if we ask you first, before we show it, to be bound in the
what-do-you-call-it of—”

“In the bonds of honour and upright dealing,” said Anthea.

“I’m afraid I don’t quite follow you,” said the gentleman, with gentle
nervousness.

“Well, it’s this way,” said Cyril. “We’ve got part of a charm. And the
Sammy—I mean, something told us it would work, though it’s only half a
one; but it won’t work unless we can say the name that’s on it. But, of
course, if you’ve got another name that can lick ours, our charm will
be no go; so we want you to give us your word of honour as a
gentleman—though I’m sure, now I’ve seen you, that it’s not necessary;
but still I’ve promised to ask you, so we must. Will you please give us
your honourable word not to say any name stronger than the name on our
charm?”

The gentleman had put on his spectacles again and was looking at Cyril
through them. He now said: “Bless me!” more than once, adding, “Who
told you all this?”

“I can’t tell you,” said Cyril. “I’m very sorry, but I can’t.”

Some faint memory of a far-off childhood must have come to the learned
gentleman just then, for he smiled. “I see,” he said. “It is some sort
of game that you are engaged in? Of course! Yes! Well, I will certainly
promise. Yet I wonder how you heard of the names of power?”

“We can’t tell you that either,” said Cyril; and Anthea said, “Here is
our charm,” and held it out.

With politeness, but without interest, the gentleman took it. But after
the first glance all his body suddenly stiffened, as a pointer’s does
when he sees a partridge.

“Excuse me,” he said in quite a changed voice, and carried the charm to
the window.

He looked at it; he turned it over. He fixed his spy-glass in his eye
and looked again. No one said anything. Only Robert made a shuffling
noise with his feet till Anthea nudged him to shut up.

At last the learned gentleman drew a long breath.

“Where did you find this?” he asked.

“We didn’t find it. We bought it at a shop. Jacob Absalom the name
is—not far from Charing Cross,” said Cyril.

“We gave seven-and-sixpence for it,” added Jane.

“It is not for sale, I suppose? You do not wish to part with it? I
ought to tell you that it is extremely valuable—extraordinarily
valuable, I may say.”

“Yes,” said Cyril, “we know that, so of course we want to keep it.”

“Keep it carefully, then,” said the gentleman impressively; “and if
ever you should wish to part with it, may I ask you to give me the
refusal of it?”

“The refusal?”

“I mean, do not sell it to anyone else until you have given me the
opportunity of buying it.”

“All right,” said Cyril, “we won’t. But we don’t want to sell it. We
want to make it do things.”

“I suppose you can play at that as well as at anything else,” said the
gentleman; “but I’m afraid the days of magic are over.”

“They aren’t _really_,” said Anthea earnestly. “You’d see they aren’t
if I could tell you about our last summer holidays. Only I mustn’t.
Thank you very much. And can you read the name?”

“Yes, I can read it.”

“Will you tell it us?”

“The name,” said the gentleman, “is Ur Hekau Setcheh.”

“Ur Hekau Setcheh,” repeated Cyril. “Thanks awfully. I do hope we
haven’t taken up too much of your time.”

“Not at all,” said the gentleman. “And do let me entreat you to be
very, very careful of that most valuable specimen.”

They said “Thank you” in all the different polite ways they could think
of, and filed out of the door and down the stairs. Anthea was last.
Half-way down to the first landing she turned and ran up again.

The door was still open, and the learned gentleman and the mummy-case
were standing opposite to each other, and both looked as though they
had stood like that for years.

The gentleman started when Anthea put her hand on his arm.

“I hope you won’t be cross and say it’s not my business,” she said,
“but do look at your chop! Don’t you think you ought to eat it? Father
forgets his dinner sometimes when he’s writing, and Mother always says
I ought to remind him if she’s not at home to do it herself, because
it’s so bad to miss your regular meals. So I thought perhaps you
wouldn’t mind my reminding you, because you don’t seem to have anyone
else to do it.”

She glanced at the mummy-case; _it_ certainly did not look as though it
would ever think of reminding people of their meals.

The learned gentleman looked at her for a moment before he said—

“Thank you, my dear. It was a kindly thought. No, I haven’t anyone to
remind me about things like that.”

He sighed, and looked at the chop.

“It looks very nasty,” said Anthea.

“Yes,” he said, “it does. I’ll eat it immediately, before I forget.”

As he ate it he sighed more than once. Perhaps because the chop was
nasty, perhaps because he longed for the charm which the children did
not want to sell, perhaps because it was so long since anyone cared
whether he ate his chops or forgot them.

Anthea caught the others at the stair-foot. They woke the Psammead, and
it taught them exactly how to use the word of power, and to make the
charm speak. I am not going to tell you how this is done, because you
might try to do it. And for you any such trying would be almost sure to
end in disappointment. Because in the first place it is a thousand
million to one against your ever getting hold of the right sort of
charm, and if you did, there would be hardly any chance at all of your
finding a learned gentleman clever enough and kind enough to read the
word for you.

The children and the Psammead crouched in a circle on the floor—in the
girls’ bedroom, because in the parlour they might have been interrupted
by old Nurse’s coming in to lay the cloth for tea—and the charm was put
in the middle of the circle.

The sun shone splendidly outside, and the room was very light. Through
the open window came the hum and rattle of London, and in the street
below they could hear the voice of the milkman.

When all was ready, the Psammead signed to Anthea to say the word. And
she said it.

Instantly the whole light of all the world seemed to go out. The room
was dark. The world outside was dark—darker than the darkest night that
ever was. And all the sounds went out too, so that there was a silence
deeper than any silence you have ever even dreamed of imagining. It was
like being suddenly deaf and blind, only darker and quieter even than
that.

But before the children had got over the sudden shock of it enough to
be frightened, a faint, beautiful light began to show in the middle of
the circle, and at the same moment a faint, beautiful voice began to
speak. The light was too small for one to see anything by, and the
voice was too small for you to hear what it said. You could just see
the light and just hear the voice.

But the light grew stronger. It was greeny, like glow-worms’ lamps, and
it grew and grew till it was as though thousands and thousands of
glow-worms were signalling to their winged sweethearts from the middle
of the circle. And the voice grew, not so much in loudness as in
sweetness (though it grew louder, too), till it was so sweet that you
wanted to cry with pleasure just at the sound of it. It was like
nightingales, and the sea, and the fiddle, and the voice of your mother
when you have been a long time away, and she meets you at the door when
you get home.

And the voice said—

“Speak. What is it that you would hear?”

I cannot tell you what language the voice used. I only know that
everyone present understood it perfectly. If you come to think of it,
there must be some language that everyone could understand, if we only
knew what it was. Nor can I tell you how the charm spoke, nor whether
it was the charm that spoke, or some presence in the charm. The
children could not have told you either. Indeed, they could not look at
the charm while it was speaking, because the light was too bright. They
looked instead at the green radiance on the faded Kidderminster carpet
at the edge of the circle. They all felt very quiet, and not inclined
to ask questions or fidget with their feet. For this was not like the
things that had happened in the country when the Psammead had given
them their wishes. That had been funny somehow, and this was not. It
was something like _Arabian Nights_ magic, and something like being in
church. No one cared to speak.

It was Cyril who said at last—

“Please we want to know where the other half of the charm is.”

“The part of the Amulet which is lost,” said the beautiful voice, “was
broken and ground into the dust of the shrine that held it. It and the
pin that joined the two halves are themselves dust, and the dust is
scattered over many lands and sunk in many seas.”

“Oh, I say!” murmured Robert, and a blank silence fell.

“Then it’s all up?” said Cyril at last; “it’s no use our looking for a
thing that’s smashed into dust, and the dust scattered all over the
place.”

“If you would find it,” said the voice, “You must seek it where it
still is, perfect as ever.”

“I don’t understand,” said Cyril.

“In the Past you may find it,” said the voice.

“I wish we _may_ find it,” said Cyril.

The Psammead whispered crossly, “Don’t you understand? The thing
existed in the Past. If you were in the Past, too, you could find it.
It’s very difficult to make you understand things. Time and space are
only forms of thought.”

“I see,” said Cyril.

“No, you don’t,” said the Psammead, “and it doesn’t matter if you
don’t, either. What I mean is that if you were only made the right way,
you could see everything happening in the same place at the same time.
Now do you see?”

“I’m afraid _I_ don’t,” said Anthea; “I’m sorry I’m so stupid.”

“Well, at any rate, you see this. That lost half of the Amulet is in
the Past. Therefore it’s in the Past we must look for it. I mustn’t
speak to the charm myself. Ask it things! Find out!”

“Where can we find the other part of you?” asked Cyril obediently.

“In the Past,” said the voice.

“What part of the Past?”

“I may not tell you. If you will choose a time, I will take you to the
place that then held it. You yourselves must find it.”

“When did you see it last?” asked Anthea—“I mean, when was it taken
away from you?”

The beautiful voice answered—

“That was thousands of years ago. The Amulet was perfect then, and lay
in a shrine, the last of many shrines, and I worked wonders. Then came
strange men with strange weapons and destroyed my shrine, and the
Amulet they bore away with many captives. But of these, one, my priest,
knew the word of power, and spoke it for me, so that the Amulet became
invisible, and thus returned to my shrine, but the shrine was broken
down, and ere any magic could rebuild it one spoke a word before which
my power bowed down and was still. And the Amulet lay there, still
perfect, but enslaved. Then one coming with stones to rebuild the
shrine, dropped a hewn stone on the Amulet as it lay, and one half was
sundered from the other. I had no power to seek for that which was
lost. And there being none to speak the word of power, I could not
rejoin it. So the Amulet lay in the dust of the desert many thousand
years, and at last came a small man, a conqueror with an army, and
after him a crowd of men who sought to seem wise, and one of these
found half the Amulet and brought it to this land. But none could read
the name. So I lay still. And this man dying and his son after him, the
Amulet was sold by those who came after to a merchant, and from him you
bought it, and it is here, and now, the name of power having been
spoken, I also am here.”

This is what the voice said. I think it must have meant Napoleon by the
small man, the conqueror. Because I know I have been told that he took
an army to Egypt, and that afterwards a lot of wise people went
grubbing in the sand, and fished up all sorts of wonderful things,
older than you would think possible. And of these I believe this charm
to have been one, and the most wonderful one of all.

Everyone listened: and everyone tried to think. It is not easy to do
this clearly when you have been listening to the kind of talk I have
told you about.

At last Robert said—

“Can you take us into the Past—to the shrine where you and the other
thing were together. If you could take us there, we might find the
other part still there after all these thousands of years.”

“Still there? silly!” said Cyril. “Don’t you see, if we go back into
the Past it won’t be thousands of years ago. It will be _now_ for
us—won’t it?” He appealed to the Psammead, who said—

“You’re not so far off the idea as you usually are!”

“Well,” said Anthea, “will you take us back to when there was a shrine
and you were safe in it—all of you?”

“Yes,” said the voice. “You must hold me up, and speak the word of
power, and one by one, beginning with the first-born, you shall pass
through me into the Past. But let the last that passes be the one that
holds me, and let him not lose his hold, lest you lose me, and so
remain in the Past for ever.”

“That’s a nasty idea,” said Robert.

“When you desire to return,” the beautiful voice went on, “hold me up
towards the East, and speak the word. Then, passing through me, you
shall return to this time and it shall be the present to you.”

“But how—”

A bell rang loudly.

“Oh crikey!” exclaimed Robert, “that’s tea! Will you please make it
proper daylight again so that we can go down. And thank you so much for
all your kindness.”

“We’ve enjoyed ourselves very much indeed, thank you!” added Anthea
politely.

The beautiful light faded slowly. The great darkness and silence came
and these suddenly changed to the dazzlement of day and the great soft,
rustling sound of London, that is like some vast beast turning over in
its sleep.

The children rubbed their eyes, the Psammead ran quickly to its sandy
bath, and the others went down to tea. And until the cups were actually
filled tea seemed less real than the beautiful voice and the greeny
light.

After tea Anthea persuaded the others to allow her to hang the charm
round her neck with a piece of string.

“It would be so awful if it got lost,” she said: “it might get lost
anywhere, you know, and it would be rather beastly for us to have to
stay in the Past for ever and ever, wouldn’t it?”




CHAPTER IV.
EIGHT THOUSAND YEARS AGO


Next morning Anthea got old Nurse to allow her to take up the “poor
learned gentleman’s” breakfast. He did not recognize her at first, but
when he did he was vaguely pleased to see her.

“You see I’m wearing the charm round my neck,” she said; “I’m taking
care of it—like you told us to.”

“That’s right,” said he; “did you have a good game last night?”

“You will eat your breakfast before it’s cold, won’t you?” said Anthea.
“Yes, we had a splendid time. The charm made it all dark, and then
greeny light, and then it spoke. Oh! I wish you could have heard it—it
was such a darling voice—and it told us the other half of it was lost
in the Past, so of course we shall have to look for it there!”

The learned gentleman rubbed his hair with both hands and looked
anxiously at Anthea.

“I suppose it’s natural—youthful imagination and so forth,” he said.
“Yet someone must have... Who told you that some part of the charm was
missing?”

“I can’t tell you,” she said. “I know it seems most awfully rude,
especially after being so kind about telling us the name of power, and
all that, but really, I’m not allowed to tell anybody anything about
the—the—the person who told me. You won’t forget your breakfast, will
you?”

The learned gentleman smiled feebly and then frowned—not a cross-frown,
but a puzzle-frown.

“Thank you,” he said, “I shall always be pleased if you’ll look in—any
time you’re passing you know—at least...”

“I will,” she said; “goodbye. I’ll always tell you anything I _may_
tell.”

He had not had many adventures with children in them, and he wondered
whether all children were like these. He spent quite five minutes in
wondering before he settled down to the fifty-second chapter of his
great book on _The Secret Rites of the Priests of Amen Rā_.

It is no use to pretend that the children did not feel a good deal of
agitation at the thought of going through the charm into the Past. That
idea, that perhaps they might stay in the Past and never get back
again, was anything but pleasing. Yet no one would have dared to
suggest that the charm should not be used; and though each was in its
heart very frightened indeed, they would all have joined in jeering at
the cowardice of any one of them who should have uttered the timid but
natural suggestion, “Don’t let’s!”

It seemed necessary to make arrangements for being out all day, for
there was no reason to suppose that the sound of the dinner-bell would
be able to reach back into the Past, and it seemed unwise to excite old
Nurse’s curiosity when nothing they could say—not even the truth—could
in any way satisfy it. They were all very proud to think how well they
had understood what the charm and the Psammead had said about Time and
Space and things like that, and they were perfectly certain that it
would be quite impossible to make old Nurse understand a single word of
it. So they merely asked her to let them take their dinner out into
Regent’s Park—and this, with the implied cold mutton and tomatoes, was
readily granted.

“You can get yourselves some buns or sponge-cakes, or whatever you
fancy-like,” said old Nurse, giving Cyril a shilling. “Don’t go getting
jam-tarts, now—so messy at the best of times, and without forks and
plates ruination to your clothes, besides your not being able to wash
your hands and faces afterwards.”

So Cyril took the shilling, and they all started off. They went round
by the Tottenham Court Road to buy a piece of waterproof sheeting to
put over the Psammead in case it should be raining in the Past when
they got there. For it is almost certain death to a Psammead to get
wet.

The sun was shining very brightly, and even London looked pretty. Women
were selling roses from big baskets-full, and Anthea bought four roses,
one each, for herself and the others. They were red roses and smelt of
summer—the kind of roses you always want so desperately at about
Christmas-time when you can only get mistletoe, which is pale right
through to its very scent, and holly which pricks your nose if you try
to smell it. So now everyone had a rose in its buttonhole, and soon
everyone was sitting on the grass in Regent’s Park under trees whose
leaves would have been clean, clear green in the country, but here were
dusty and yellowish, and brown at the edges.

“We’ve got to go on with it,” said Anthea, “and as the eldest has to go
first, you’ll have to be last, Jane. You quite understand about holding
on to the charm as you go through, don’t you, Pussy?”

“I wish I hadn’t got to be last,” said Jane.

“You shall carry the Psammead if you like,” said Anthea. “That is,” she
added, remembering the beast’s queer temper, “if it’ll let you.”

The Psammead, however, was unexpectedly amiable.

“_I_ don’t mind,” it said, “who carries me, so long as it doesn’t drop
me. I can’t bear being dropped.”

Jane with trembling hands took the Psammead and its fish-basket under
one arm. The charm’s long string was hung round her neck. Then they all
stood up. Jane held out the charm at arm’s length, and Cyril solemnly
pronounced the word of power.

As he spoke it the charm grew tall and broad, and he saw that Jane was
just holding on to the edge of a great red arch of very curious shape.
The opening of the arch was small, but Cyril saw that he could go
through it. All round and beyond the arch were the faded trees and
trampled grass of Regent’s Park, where the little ragged children were
playing Ring-o’-Roses. But through the opening of it shone a blaze of
blue and yellow and red. Cyril drew a long breath and stiffened his
legs so that the others should not see that his knees were trembling
and almost knocking together. “Here goes!” he said, and, stepping up
through the arch, disappeared. Then followed Anthea. Robert, coming
next, held fast, at Anthea’s suggestion, to the sleeve of Jane, who was
thus dragged safely through the arch. And as soon as they were on the
other side of the arch there was no more arch at all and no more
Regent’s Park either, only the charm in Jane’s hand, and it was its
proper size again. They were now in a light so bright that they winked
and blinked and rubbed their eyes. During this dazzling interval Anthea
felt for the charm and pushed it inside Jane’s frock, so that it might
be quite safe. When their eyes got used to the new wonderful light the
children looked around them. The sky was very, very blue, and it
sparkled and glittered and dazzled like the sea at home when the sun
shines on it.

They were standing on a little clearing in a thick, low forest; there
were trees and shrubs and a close, thorny, tangly undergrowth. In front
of them stretched a bank of strange black mud, then came the
browny-yellowy shining ribbon of a river. Then more dry, caked mud and
more greeny-browny jungle. The only things that told that human people
had been there were the clearing, a path that led to it, and an odd
arrangement of cut reeds in the river.

They looked at each other.

“Well!” said Robert, “this _is_ a change of air!”

It was. The air was hotter than they could have imagined, even in
London in August.

“I wish I knew where we were,” said Cyril.

“Here’s a river, now—I wonder whether it’s the Amazon or the Tiber, or
what.”

“It’s the Nile,” said the Psammead, looking out of the fish-bag.

“Then this is Egypt,” said Robert, who had once taken a geography
prize.

“I don’t see any crocodiles,” Cyril objected. His prize had been for
natural history.

The Psammead reached out a hairy arm from its basket and pointed to a
heap of mud at the edge of the water.

“What do you call that?” it said; and as it spoke the heap of mud slid
into the river just as a slab of damp mixed mortar will slip from a
bricklayer’s trowel.

“Oh!” said everybody.

There was a crashing among the reeds on the other side of the water.

“And there’s a river-horse!” said the Psammead, as a great beast like
an enormous slaty-blue slug showed itself against the black bank on the
far side of the stream.

“It’s a hippopotamus,” said Cyril; “it seems much more real somehow
than the one at the Zoo, doesn’t it?”

“I’m glad it’s being real on the other side of the river,” said Jane.

And now there was a crackling of reeds and twigs behind them. This was
horrible. Of course it might be another hippopotamus, or a crocodile,
or a lion—or, in fact, almost anything.

“Keep your hand on the charm, Jane,” said Robert hastily. “We ought to
have a means of escape handy. I’m dead certain this is the sort of
place where simply anything _might_ happen to us.”

“I believe a hippopotamus is going to happen to us,” said Jane—“a very,
very big one.”

They had all turned to face the danger.

“Don’t be silly little duffers,” said the Psammead in its friendly,
informal way; “it’s not a river-horse. It’s a human.”

It was. It was a girl—of about Anthea’s age. Her hair was short and
fair, and though her skin was tanned by the sun, you could see that it
would have been fair too if it had had a chance. She had every chance
of being tanned, for she had no clothes to speak of, and the four
English children, carefully dressed in frocks, hats, shoes, stockings,
coats, collars, and all the rest of it, envied her more than any words
of theirs or of mine could possibly say. There was no doubt that here
was the right costume for that climate.

She carried a pot on her head, of red and black earthenware. She did
not see the children, who shrank back against the edge of the jungle,
and she went forward to the brink of the river to fill her pitcher. As
she went she made a strange sort of droning, humming, melancholy noise
all on two notes. Anthea could not help thinking that perhaps the girl
thought this noise was singing.

The girl filled the pitcher and set it down by the river bank. Then she
waded into the water and stooped over the circle of cut reeds. She
pulled half a dozen fine fish out of the water within the reeds,
killing each as she took it out, and threading it on a long osier that
she carried. Then she knotted the osier, hung it on her arm, picked up
the pitcher, and turned to come back. And as she turned she saw the
four children. The white dresses of Jane and Anthea stood out like snow
against the dark forest background. She screamed and the pitcher fell,
and the water was spilled out over the hard mud surface and over the
fish, which had fallen too. Then the water slowly trickled away into
the deep cracks.

“Don’t be frightened,” Anthea cried, “we won’t hurt you.”

“Who are you?” said the girl.

Now, once for all, I am not going to be bothered to tell you how it was
that the girl could understand Anthea and Anthea could understand the
girl. _You_, at any rate, would not understand _me_, if I tried to
explain it, any more than you can understand about time and space being
only forms of thought. You may think what you like. Perhaps the
children had found out the universal language which everyone can
understand, and which wise men so far have not found. You will have
noticed long ago that they were singularly lucky children, and they may
have had this piece of luck as well as others. Or it may have been
that... but why pursue the question further? The fact remains that in
all their adventures the muddle-headed inventions which we call foreign
languages never bothered them in the least. They could always
understand and be understood. If you can explain this, please do. I
daresay I could understand your explanation, though you could never
understand mine.

So when the girl said, “Who are you?” everyone understood at once, and
Anthea replied—

“We are children—just like you. Don’t be frightened. Won’t you show us
where you live?”

Jane put her face right into the Psammead’s basket, and burrowed her
mouth into its fur to whisper—

“Is it safe? Won’t they eat us? Are they cannibals?”

The Psammead shrugged its fur.

“Don’t make your voice buzz like that, it tickles my ears,” it said
rather crossly. “You can always get back to Regent’s Park in time if
you keep fast hold of the charm,” it said.

The strange girl was trembling with fright.

Anthea had a bangle on her arm. It was a sevenpenny-halfpenny trumpery
thing that pretended to be silver; it had a glass heart of turquoise
blue hanging from it, and it was the gift of the maid-of-all-work at
the Fitzroy Street house.

“Here,” said Anthea, “this is for you. That is to show we will not hurt
you. And if you take it I shall know that you won’t hurt us.”

The girl held out her hand. Anthea slid the bangle over it, and the
girl’s face lighted up with the joy of possession.

“Come,” she said, looking lovingly at the bangle; “it is peace between
your house and mine.”

She picked up her fish and pitcher and led the way up the narrow path
by which she had come and the others followed.

“This is something like!” said Cyril, trying to be brave.

“Yes!” said Robert, also assuming a boldness he was far from feeling,
“this really and truly _is_ an adventure! Its being in the Past makes
it quite different from the Phœnix and Carpet happenings.”

The belt of thick-growing acacia trees and shrubs—mostly prickly and
unpleasant-looking—seemed about half a mile across. The path was narrow
and the wood dark. At last, ahead, daylight shone through the boughs
and leaves.

The whole party suddenly came out of the wood’s shadow into the glare
of the sunlight that shone on a great stretch of yellow sand, dotted
with heaps of grey rocks where spiky cactus plants showed gaudy crimson
and pink flowers among their shabby, sand-peppered leaves. Away to the
right was something that looked like a grey-brown hedge, and from
beyond it blue smoke went up to the bluer sky. And over all the sun
shone till you could hardly bear your clothes.

“That is where I live,” said the girl pointing.

“I won’t go,” whispered Jane into the basket, “unless you say it’s all
right.”

The Psammead ought to have been touched by this proof of confidence.
Perhaps, however, it looked upon it as a proof of doubt, for it merely
snarled—

“If you don’t go now I’ll never help you again.”

“_Oh_,” whispered Anthea, “dear Jane, don’t! Think of Father and Mother
and all of us getting our heart’s desire. And we can go back any
minute. Come on!”

“Besides,” said Cyril, in a low voice, “the Psammead must know there’s
no danger or it wouldn’t go. It’s not so over and above brave itself.
Come on!”

This Jane at last consented to do.

As they got nearer to the browny fence they saw that it was a great
hedge about eight feet high, made of piled-up thorn bushes.

“What’s that for?” asked Cyril.

“To keep out foes and wild beasts,” said the girl.

“I should think it ought to, too,” said he. “Why, some of the thorns
are as long as my foot.”

There was an opening in the hedge, and they followed the girl through
it. A little way further on was another hedge, not so high, also of dry
thorn bushes, very prickly and spiteful-looking, and within this was a
sort of village of huts.

There were no gardens and no roads. Just huts built of wood and twigs
and clay, and roofed with great palm-leaves, dumped down anywhere. The
doors of these houses were very low, like the doors of dog-kennels. The
ground between them was not paths or streets, but just yellow sand
trampled very hard and smooth.

In the middle of the village there was a hedge that enclosed what
seemed to be a piece of ground about as big as their own garden in
Camden Town.

No sooner were the children well within the inner thorn hedge than
dozens of men and women and children came crowding round from behind
and inside the huts.

The girl stood protectingly in front of the four children, and said—

“They are wonder-children from beyond the desert. They bring marvellous
gifts, and I have said that it is peace between us and them.”

She held out her arm with the Lowther Arcade bangle on it.

The children from London, where nothing now surprises anyone, had never
before seen so many people look so astonished.

They crowded round the children, touching their clothes, their shoes,
the buttons on the boys’ jackets, and the coral of the girls’
necklaces.

“Do say something,” whispered Anthea.

“We come,” said Cyril, with some dim remembrance of a dreadful day when
he had had to wait in an outer office while his father interviewed a
solicitor, and there had been nothing to read but the _Daily
Telegraph_—“we come from the world where the sun never sets. And peace
with honour is what we want. We are the great Anglo-Saxon or conquering
race. Not that we want to conquer _you_,” he added hastily. “We only
want to look at your houses and your—well, at all you’ve got here, and
then we shall return to our own place, and tell of all that we have
seen so that your name may be famed.”

Cyril’s speech didn’t keep the crowd from pressing round and looking as
eagerly as ever at the clothing of the children. Anthea had an idea
that these people had never seen woven stuff before, and she saw how
wonderful and strange it must seem to people who had never had any
clothes but the skins of beasts. The sewing, too, of modern clothes
seemed to astonish them very much. They must have been able to sew
themselves, by the way, for men who seemed to be the chiefs wore
knickerbockers of goat-skin or deer-skin, fastened round the waist with
twisted strips of hide. And the women wore long skimpy skirts of
animals’ skins. The people were not very tall, their hair was fair, and
men and women both had it short. Their eyes were blue, and that seemed
odd in Egypt. Most of them were tattooed like sailors, only more
roughly.

“What is this? What is this?” they kept asking touching the children’s
clothes curiously.

Anthea hastily took off Jane’s frilly lace collar and handed it to the
woman who seemed most friendly.

“Take this,” she said, “and look at it. And leave us alone. We want to
talk among ourselves.”

She spoke in the tone of authority which she had always found
successful when she had not time to coax her baby brother to do as he
was told. The tone was just as successful now. The children were left
together and the crowd retreated. It paused a dozen yards away to look
at the lace collar and to go on talking as hard as it could.

The children will never know what those people said, though they knew
well enough that they, the four strangers, were the subject of the
talk. They tried to comfort themselves by remembering the girl’s
promise of friendliness, but of course the thought of the charm was
more comfortable than anything else. They sat down on the sand in the
shadow of the hedged-round place in the middle of the village, and now
for the first time they were able to look about them and to see
something more than a crowd of eager, curious faces.

They here noticed that the women wore necklaces made of beads of
different coloured stone, and from these hung pendants of odd, strange
shapes, and some of them had bracelets of ivory and flint.

“I say,” said Robert, “what a lot we could teach them if we stayed
here!”

“I expect they could teach us something too,” said Cyril. “Did you
notice that flint bracelet the woman had that Anthea gave the collar
to? That must have taken some making. Look here, they’ll get suspicious
if we talk among ourselves, and I do want to know about how they do
things. Let’s get the girl to show us round, and we can be thinking
about how to get the Amulet at the same time. Only mind, we must keep
together.”

Anthea beckoned to the girl, who was standing a little way off looking
wistfully at them, and she came gladly.

“Tell us how you make the bracelets, the stone ones,” said Cyril.

“With other stones,” said the girl; “the men make them; we have men of
special skill in such work.”

“Haven’t you any iron tools?”

“Iron,” said the girl, “I don’t know what you mean.” It was the first
word she had not understood.

“Are all your tools of flint?” asked Cyril.

“Of course,” said the girl, opening her eyes wide.

I wish I had time to tell you of that talk. The English children wanted
to hear all about this new place, but they also wanted to tell of their
own country. It was like when you come back from your holidays and you
want to hear and to tell everything at the same time. As the talk went
on there were more and more words that the girl could not understand,
and the children soon gave up the attempt to explain to her what their
own country was like, when they began to see how very few of the things
they had always thought they could not do without were really not at
all necessary to life.

The girl showed them how the huts were made—indeed, as one was being
made that very day she took them to look at it. The way of building was
very different from ours. The men stuck long pieces of wood into a
piece of ground the size of the hut they wanted to make. These were
about eight inches apart; then they put in another row about eight
inches away from the first, and then a third row still further out.
Then all the space between was filled up with small branches and twigs,
and then daubed over with black mud worked with the feet till it was
soft and sticky like putty.

The girl told them how the men went hunting with flint spears and
arrows, and how they made boats with reeds and clay. Then she explained
the reed thing in the river that she had taken the fish out of. It was
a fish-trap—just a ring of reeds set up in the water with only one
little opening in it, and in this opening, just below the water, were
stuck reeds slanting the way of the river’s flow, so that the fish,
when they had swum sillily in, sillily couldn’t get out again. She
showed them the clay pots and jars and platters, some of them
ornamented with black and red patterns, and the most wonderful things
made of flint and different sorts of stone, beads, and ornaments, and
tools and weapons of all sorts and kinds.

“It is really wonderful,” said Cyril patronizingly, “when you consider
that it’s all eight thousand years ago—”

“I don’t understand you,” said the girl.

“It _isn’t_ eight thousand years ago,” whispered Jane. “It’s _now_—and
that’s just what I don’t like about it. I say, _do_ let’s get home
again before anything more happens. You can see for yourselves the
charm isn’t here.”

“What’s in that place in the middle?” asked Anthea, struck by a sudden
thought, and pointing to the fence.

“That’s the secret sacred place,” said the girl in a whisper. “No one
knows what is there. There are many walls, and inside the insidest one
_It_ is, but no one knows what _It_ is except the headsmen.”

“I believe _you_ know,” said Cyril, looking at her very hard.

“I’ll give you this if you’ll tell me,” said Anthea taking off a
bead-ring which had already been much admired.

“Yes,” said the girl, catching eagerly at the ring. “My father is one
of the heads, and I know a water charm to make him talk in his sleep.
And he has spoken. I will tell you. But if they know I have told you
they will kill me. In the insidest inside there is a stone box, and in
it there is the Amulet. None knows whence it came. It came from very
far away.”

“Have you seen it?” asked Anthea.

The girl nodded.

“Is it anything like this?” asked Jane, rashly producing the charm.

The girl’s face turned a sickly greenish-white.

“Hide it, hide it,” she whispered. “You must put it back. If they see
it they will kill us all. You for taking it, and me for knowing that
there was such a thing. Oh, woe—woe! why did you ever come here?”

“Don’t be frightened,” said Cyril. “They shan’t know. Jane, don’t you
be such a little jack-ape again—that’s all. You see what will happen if
you do. Now, tell me—” He turned to the girl, but before he had time to
speak the question there was a loud shout, and a man bounded in through
the opening in the thorn-hedge.

“Many foes are upon us!” he cried. “Make ready the defences!”

His breath only served for that, and he lay panting on the ground.

“Oh, _do_ let’s go home!” said Jane. “Look here—I don’t care—I _will!_”

She held up the charm. Fortunately all the strange, fair people were
too busy to notice _her_. She held up the charm. And nothing happened.

“You haven’t said the word of power,” said Anthea.

Jane hastily said it—and still nothing happened.

“Hold it up towards the East, you silly!” said Robert.

“Which _is_ the East?” said Jane, dancing about in her agony of terror.

Nobody knew. So they opened the fish-bag to ask the Psammead.

And the bag had only a waterproof sheet in it.

The Psammead was gone.

“Hide the sacred thing! Hide it! Hide it!” whispered the girl.

Cyril shrugged his shoulders, and tried to look as brave as he knew he
ought to feel.

“Hide it up, Pussy,” he said. “We are in for it now. We’ve just got to
stay and see it out.”




CHAPTER V.
THE FIGHT IN THE VILLAGE


Here was a horrible position! Four English children, whose proper date
was A.D. 1905, and whose proper address was London, set down in Egypt
in the year 6000 B.C. with no means whatever of getting back into their
own time and place. They could not find the East, and the sun was of no
use at the moment, because some officious person had once explained to
Cyril that the sun did not really set in the West at all—nor rise in
the East either, for the matter of that.

The Psammead had crept out of the bass-bag when they were not looking
and had basely deserted them.

An enemy was approaching. There would be a fight. People get killed in
fights, and the idea of taking part in a fight was one that did not
appeal to the children.

The man who had brought the news of the enemy still lay panting on the
sand. His tongue was hanging out, long and red, like a dog’s. The
people of the village were hurriedly filling the gaps in the fence with
thorn-bushes from the heap that seemed to have been piled there ready
for just such a need. They lifted the cluster-thorns with long
poles—much as men at home, nowadays, lift hay with a fork.

Jane bit her lip and tried to decide not to cry.

Robert felt in his pocket for a toy pistol and loaded it with a pink
paper cap. It was his only weapon.

Cyril tightened his belt two holes.

And Anthea absently took the drooping red roses from the buttonholes of
the others, bit the ends of the stalks, and set them in a pot of water
that stood in the shadow by a hut door. She was always rather silly
about flowers.

“Look here!” she said. “I think perhaps the Psammead is really
arranging something for us. I don’t believe it would go away and leave
us all alone in the Past. I’m certain it wouldn’t.”

Jane succeeded in deciding not to cry—at any rate yet.

“But what can we do?” Robert asked.

“Nothing,” Cyril answered promptly, “except keep our eyes and ears
open. Look! That runner chap’s getting his wind. Let’s go and hear what
he’s got to say.”

The runner had risen to his knees and was sitting back on his heels.
Now he stood up and spoke. He began by some respectful remarks
addressed to the heads of the village. His speech got more interesting
when he said—

“I went out in my raft to snare ibises, and I had gone up the stream an
hour’s journey. Then I set my snares and waited. And I heard the sound
of many wings, and looking up, saw many herons circling in the air. And
I saw that they were afraid; so I took thought. A beast may scare one
heron, coming upon it suddenly, but no beast will scare a whole flock
of herons. And still they flew and circled, and would not light. So
then I knew that what scared the herons must be men, and men who knew
not our ways of going softly so as to take the birds and beasts
unawares. By this I knew they were not of our race or of our place. So,
leaving my raft, I crept along the river bank, and at last came upon
the strangers. They are many as the sands of the desert, and their
spear-heads shine red like the sun. They are a terrible people, and
their march is towards us. Having seen this, I ran, and did not stay
till I was before you.”

“These are _your_ folk,” said the headman, turning suddenly and angrily
on Cyril, “you came as spies for them.”

“We did _not_,” said Cyril indignantly. “We wouldn’t be spies for
anything. I’m certain these people aren’t a bit like us. Are they now?”
he asked the runner.

“No,” was the answer. “These men’s faces were darkened, and their hair
black as night. Yet these strange children, maybe, are their gods, who
have come before to make ready the way for them.”

A murmur ran through the crowd.

“No, _no_,” said Cyril again. “We are on your side. We will help you to
guard your sacred things.”

The headman seemed impressed by the fact that Cyril knew that there
_were_ sacred things to be guarded. He stood a moment gazing at the
children. Then he said—

“It is well. And now let all make offering, that we may be strong in
battle.”

The crowd dispersed, and nine men, wearing antelope-skins, grouped
themselves in front of the opening in the hedge in the middle of the
village. And presently, one by one, the men brought all sorts of
things—hippopotamus flesh, ostrich-feathers, the fruit of the date
palms, red chalk, green chalk, fish from the river, and ibex from the
mountains; and the headman received these gifts. There was another
hedge inside the first, about a yard from it, so that there was a lane
inside between the hedges. And every now and then one of the headmen
would disappear along this lane with full hands and come back with
hands empty.

“They’re making offerings to their Amulet,” said Anthea. “We’d better
give something too.”

The pockets of the party, hastily explored, yielded a piece of pink
tape, a bit of sealing-wax, and part of the Waterbury watch that Robert
had not been able to help taking to pieces at Christmas and had never
had time to rearrange. Most boys have a watch in this condition.

They presented their offerings, and Anthea added the red roses.

The headman who took the things looked at them with awe, especially at
the red roses and the Waterbury-watch fragment.

“This is a day of very wondrous happenings,” he said. “I have no more
room in me to be astonished. Our maiden said there was peace between
you and us. But for this coming of a foe we should have made sure.”

The children shuddered.

“Now speak. Are you upon our side?”

“_Yes_. Don’t I keep telling you we are?” Robert said. “Look here. I
will give you a sign. You see this.” He held out the toy pistol. “I
shall speak to it, and if it answers me you will know that I and the
others are come to guard your sacred thing—that we’ve just made the
offerings to.”

“Will that god whose image you hold in your hand speak to you alone, or
shall I also hear it?” asked the man cautiously.

“You’ll be surprised when you _do_ hear it,” said Robert. “Now, then.”
He looked at the pistol and said—

“If we are to guard the sacred treasure within”—he pointed to the
hedged-in space—“speak with thy loud voice, and we shall obey.”

He pulled the trigger, and the cap went off. The noise was loud, for it
was a two-shilling pistol, and the caps were excellent.

Every man, woman, and child in the village fell on its face on the
sand.

The headman who had accepted the test rose first.

“The voice has spoken,” he said. “Lead them into the ante-room of the
sacred thing.”

So now the four children were led in through the opening of the hedge
and round the lane till they came to an opening in the inner hedge, and
they went through an opening in that, and so passed into another lane.

The thing was built something like this, and all the hedges were of
brushwood and thorns:

[Illustration]

“It’s like the maze at Hampton Court,” whispered Anthea.

The lanes were all open to the sky, but the little hut in the middle of
the maze was round-roofed, and a curtain of skins hung over the
doorway.

“Here you may wait,” said their guide, “but do not dare to pass the
curtain.” He himself passed it and disappeared.

“But look here,” whispered Cyril, “some of us ought to be outside in
case the Psammead turns up.”

“Don’t let’s get separated from each other, whatever we do,” said
Anthea. “It’s quite bad enough to be separated from the Psammead. We
can’t do anything while that man is in there. Let’s all go out into the
village again. We can come back later now we know the way in. That
man’ll have to fight like the rest, most likely, if it comes to
fighting. If we find the Psammead we’ll go straight home. It must be
getting late, and I don’t much like this mazy place.”

They went out and told the headman that they would protect the treasure
when the fighting began. And now they looked about them and were able
to see exactly how a first-class worker in flint flakes and notches an
arrow-head or the edge of an axe—an advantage which no other person now
alive has ever enjoyed. The boys found the weapons most interesting.
The arrow-heads were not on arrows such as you shoot from a bow, but on
javelins, for throwing from the hand. The chief weapon was a stone
fastened to a rather short stick something like the things gentlemen
used to carry about and call life-preservers in the days of the
garrotters. Then there were long things like spears or lances, with
flint knives—horribly sharp—and flint battle-axes.

Everyone in the village was so busy that the place was like an ant-heap
when you have walked into it by accident. The women were busy and even
the children.

Quite suddenly all the air seemed to glow and grow red—it was like the
sudden opening of a furnace door, such as you may see at Woolwich
Arsenal if you ever have the luck to be taken there—and then almost as
suddenly it was as though the furnace doors had been shut. For the sun
had set, and it was night.

The sun had that abrupt way of setting in Egypt eight thousand years
ago, and I believe it has never been able to break itself of the habit,
and sets in exactly the same manner to the present day. The girl
brought the skins of wild deer and led the children to a heap of dry
sedge.

“My father says they will not attack yet. Sleep!” she said, and it
really seemed a good idea. You may think that in the midst of all these
dangers the children would not have been able to sleep—but somehow,
though they were rather frightened now and then, the feeling was
growing in them—deep down and almost hidden away, but still
growing—that the Psammead was to be trusted, and that they were really
and truly safe. This did not prevent their being quite as much
frightened as they could bear to be without being perfectly miserable.

“I suppose we’d better go to sleep,” said Robert. “I don’t know what on
earth poor old Nurse will do with us out all night; set the police on
our tracks, I expect. I only wish they could find us! A dozen policemen
would be rather welcome just now. But it’s no use getting into a stew
over it,” he added soothingly. “Good night.”

And they all fell asleep.

They were awakened by long, loud, terrible sounds that seemed to come
from everywhere at once—horrible threatening shouts and shrieks and
howls that sounded, as Cyril said later, like the voices of men
thirsting for their enemies’ blood.

“It is the voice of the strange men,” said the girl, coming to them
trembling through the dark. “They have attacked the walls, and the
thorns have driven them back. My father says they will not try again
till daylight. But they are shouting to frighten us. As though we were
savages! Dwellers in the swamps!” she cried indignantly.

All night the terrible noise went on, but when the sun rose, as
abruptly as he had set, the sound suddenly ceased.

The children had hardly time to be glad of this before a shower of
javelins came hurtling over the great thorn-hedge, and everyone
sheltered behind the huts. But next moment another shower of weapons
came from the opposite side, and the crowd rushed to other shelter.
Cyril pulled out a javelin that had stuck in the roof of the hut beside
him. Its head was of brightly burnished copper.

Then the sound of shouting arose again and the crackle of dried thorns.
The enemy was breaking down the hedge. All the villagers swarmed to the
point whence the crackling and the shouting came; they hurled stones
over the hedges, and short arrows with flint heads. The children had
never before seen men with the fighting light in their eyes. It was
very strange and terrible, and gave you a queer thick feeling in your
throat; it was quite different from the pictures of fights in the
illustrated papers at home.

It seemed that the shower of stones had driven back the besiegers. The
besieged drew breath, but at that moment the shouting and the crackling
arose on the opposite side of the village and the crowd hastened to
defend that point, and so the fight swayed to and fro across the
village, for the besieged had not the sense to divide their forces as
their enemies had done.

Cyril noticed that every now and then certain of the fighting-men would
enter the maze, and come out with brighter faces, a braver aspect, and
a more upright carriage.

“I believe they go and touch the Amulet,” he said. “You know the
Psammead said it could make people brave.”

They crept through the maze, and watching they saw that Cyril was
right. A headman was standing in front of the skin curtain, and as the
warriors came before him he murmured a word they could not hear, and
touched their foreheads with something that they could not see. And
this something he held in his hands. And through his fingers they saw
the gleam of a red stone that they knew.

The fight raged across the thorn-hedge outside. Suddenly there was a
loud and bitter cry.

“They’re in! They’re in! The hedge is down!”

The headman disappeared behind the deer-skin curtain.

“He’s gone to hide it,” said Anthea. “Oh, Psammead dear, how could you
leave us!”

Suddenly there was a shriek from inside the hut, and the headman
staggered out white with fear and fled out through the maze. The
children were as white as he.

“Oh! What is it? What is it?” moaned Anthea. “Oh, Psammead, how could
you! How could you!”

And the sound of the fight sank breathlessly, and swelled fiercely all
around. It was like the rising and falling of the waves of the sea.

Anthea shuddered and said again, “Oh, Psammead, Psammead!”

“Well?” said a brisk voice, and the curtain of skins was lifted at one
corner by a furry hand, and out peeped the bat’s ears and snail’s eyes
of the Psammead.

Anthea caught it in her arms and a sigh of desperate relief was
breathed by each of the four.

“Oh! which _is_ the East!” Anthea said, and she spoke hurriedly, for
the noise of wild fighting drew nearer and nearer.

“Don’t choke me,” said the Psammead, “come inside.”

The inside of the hut was pitch dark.

“I’ve got a match,” said Cyril, and struck it. The floor of the hut was
of soft, loose sand.

“I’ve been asleep here,” said the Psammead; “most comfortable it’s
been, the best sand I’ve had for a month. It’s all right. Everything’s
all right. I knew your only chance would be while the fight was going
on. That man won’t come back. I bit him, and he thinks I’m an Evil
Spirit. Now you’ve only got to take the thing and go.”

The hut was hung with skins. Heaped in the middle were the offerings
that had been given the night before, Anthea’s roses fading on the top
of the heap. At one side of the hut stood a large square stone block,
and on it an oblong box of earthenware with strange figures of men and
beasts on it.

“Is the thing in there?” asked Cyril, as the Psammead pointed a skinny
finger at it.

“You must judge of that,” said the Psammead. “The man was just going to
bury the box in the sand when I jumped out at him and bit him.”

“Light another match, Robert,” said Anthea. “Now, then quick! which is
the East?”

“Why, where the sun rises, of course!”

“But someone told us—”

“Oh! they’ll tell you anything!” said the Psammead impatiently, getting
into its bass-bag and wrapping itself in its waterproof sheet.

“But we can’t see the sun in here, and it isn’t rising anyhow,” said
Jane.

“How you do waste time!” the Psammead said. “Why, the East’s where the
shrine is, of course. _There!_”

It pointed to the great stone.

And still the shouting and the clash of stone on metal sounded nearer
and nearer. The children could hear that the headmen had surrounded the
hut to protect their treasure as long as might be from the enemy. But
none dare to come in after the Psammead’s sudden fierce biting of the
headman.

“Now, Jane,” said Cyril, very quickly. “I’ll take the Amulet, you stand
ready to hold up the charm, and be sure you don’t let it go as you come
through.”

He made a step forward, but at that instant a great crackling overhead
ended in a blaze of sunlight. The roof had been broken in at one side,
and great slabs of it were being lifted off by two spears. As the
children trembled and winked in the new light, large dark hands tore
down the wall, and a dark face, with a blobby fat nose, looked over the
gap. Even at that awful moment Anthea had time to think that it was
very like the face of Mr Jacob Absalom, who had sold them the charm in
the shop near Charing Cross.

“Here is their Amulet,” cried a harsh, strange voice; “it is this that
makes them strong to fight and brave to die. And what else have we
here—gods or demons?”

He glared fiercely at the children, and the whites of his eyes were
very white indeed. He had a wet, red copper knife in his teeth. There
was not a moment to lose.

“Jane, _Jane_, QUICK!” cried everyone passionately.

Jane with trembling hands held up the charm towards the East, and Cyril
spoke the word of power. The Amulet grew to a great arch. Out beyond it
was the glaring Egyptian sky, the broken wall, the cruel, dark,
big-nosed face with the red, wet knife in its gleaming teeth. Within
the arch was the dull, faint, greeny-brown of London grass and trees.

“Hold tight, Jane!” Cyril cried, and he dashed through the arch,
dragging Anthea and the Psammead after him. Robert followed, clutching
Jane. And in the ears of each, as they passed through the arch of the
charm, the sound and fury of battle died out suddenly and utterly, and
they heard only the low, dull, discontented hum of vast London, and the
peeking and patting of the sparrows on the gravel and the voices of the
ragged baby children playing Ring-o’-Roses on the yellow trampled
grass. And the charm was a little charm again in Jane’s hand, and there
was the basket with their dinner and the bathbuns lying just where they
had left it.

“My hat!” said Cyril, drawing a long breath; “that was something like
an adventure.”

“It was rather like one, certainly,” said the Psammead.

They all lay still, breathing in the safe, quiet air of Regent’s Park.

“We’d better go home at once,” said Anthea presently. “Old Nurse will
be most frightfully anxious. The sun looks about the same as it did
when we started yesterday. We’ve been away twenty-four hours.”

“The buns are quite soft still,” said Cyril, feeling one; “I suppose
the dew kept them fresh.”

They were not hungry, curiously enough.

They picked up the dinner-basket and the Psammead-basket, and went
straight home.

Old Nurse met them with amazement.

“Well, if ever I did!” she said. “What’s gone wrong? You’ve soon tired
of your picnic.”

The children took this to be bitter irony, which means saying the exact
opposite of what you mean in order to make yourself disagreeable; as
when you happen to have a dirty face, and someone says, “How nice and
clean you look!”

“We’re very sorry,” began Anthea, but old Nurse said—

“Oh, bless me, child, I don’t care! Please yourselves and you’ll please
me. Come in and get your dinners comf’table. I’ve got a potato on
a-boiling.”

When she had gone to attend to the potatoes the children looked at each
other. Could it be that old Nurse had so changed that she no longer
cared that they should have been away from home for twenty-four
hours—all night in fact—without any explanation whatever?

But the Psammead put its head out of its basket and said—

“What’s the matter? Don’t you understand? You come back through the
charm-arch at the same time as you go through it. This isn’t tomorrow!”

“Is it still yesterday?” asked Jane.

“No, it’s today. The same as it’s always been. It wouldn’t do to go
mixing up the present and the Past, and cutting bits out of one to fit
into the other.”

“Then all that adventure took no time at all?”

“You can call it that if you like,” said the Psammead. “It took none of
the modern time, anyhow.”

That evening Anthea carried up a steak for the learned gentleman’s
dinner. She persuaded Beatrice, the maid-of-all-work, who had given her
the bangle with the blue stone, to let her do it. And she stayed and
talked to him, by special invitation, while he ate the dinner.

She told him the whole adventure, beginning with—

“This afternoon we found ourselves on the bank of the River Nile,” and
ending up with, “And then we remembered how to get back, and there we
were in Regent’s Park, and it hadn’t taken any time at all.”

She did not tell anything about the charm or the Psammead, because that
was forbidden, but the story was quite wonderful enough even as it was
to entrance the learned gentleman.

“You are a most unusual little girl,” he said. “Who tells you all these
things?”

“No one,” said Anthea, “they just happen.”

“Make-believe,” he said slowly, as one who recalls and pronounces a
long-forgotten word.

He sat long after she had left him. At last he roused himself with a
start.

“I really must take a holiday,” he said; “my nerves must be all out of
order. I actually have a perfectly distinct impression that the little
girl from the rooms below came in and gave me a coherent and graphic
picture of life as I conceive it to have been in pre-dynastic Egypt.
Strange what tricks the mind will play! I shall have to be more
careful.”

He finished his bread conscientiously, and actually went for a mile
walk before he went back to his work.




CHAPTER VI.
THE WAY TO BABYLON


“How many miles to Babylon?
    Three score and ten!
Can I get there by candle light?
    Yes, and back again!”


Jane was singing to her doll, rocking it to and fro in the house which
she had made for herself and it. The roof of the house was the
dining-table, and the walls were tablecloths and antimacassars hanging
all round, and kept in their places by books laid on their top ends at
the table edge.

The others were tasting the fearful joys of domestic tobogganing. You
know how it is done—with the largest and best tea-tray and the surface
of the stair carpet. It is best to do it on the days when the stair
rods are being cleaned, and the carpet is only held by the nails at the
top. Of course, it is one of the five or six thoroughly tip-top games
that grown-up people are so unjust to—and old Nurse, though a brick in
many respects, was quite enough of a standard grown-up to put her foot
down on the tobogganing long before any of the performers had had half
enough of it. The tea-tray was taken away, and the baffled party
entered the sitting-room, in exactly the mood not to be pleased if they
could help it.

So Cyril said, “What a beastly mess!”

And Robert added, “Do shut up, Jane!”

Even Anthea, who was almost always kind, advised Jane to try another
song. “I’m sick to death of that,” said she.

It was a wet day, so none of the plans for seeing all the sights of
London that can be seen for nothing could be carried out. Everyone had
been thinking all the morning about the wonderful adventures of the day
before, when Jane had held up the charm and it had turned into an arch,
through which they had walked straight out of the present time and the
Regent’s Park into the land of Egypt eight thousand years ago. The
memory of yesterday’s happenings was still extremely fresh and
frightening, so that everyone hoped that no one would suggest another
excursion into the past, for it seemed to all that yesterday’s
adventures were quite enough to last for at least a week. Yet each felt
a little anxious that the others should not think it was afraid, and
presently Cyril, who really was not a coward, began to see that it
would not be at all nice if he should have to think himself one. So he
said—

“I say—about that charm—Jane—come out. We ought to talk about it,
anyhow.”

“Oh, if that’s all,” said Robert.

Jane obediently wriggled to the front of her house and sat there. She
felt for the charm, to make sure that it was still round her neck.

“It _isn’t_ all,” said Cyril, saying much more than he meant because he
thought Robert’s tone had been rude—as indeed it had. “We ought to go
and look for that Amulet. What’s the good of having a first-class charm
and keeping it idle, just eating its head off in the stable.”

“_I’m_ game for anything, of course,” said Robert; but he added, with a
fine air of chivalry, “only I don’t think the girls are keen today
somehow.”

“Oh, yes; I am,” said Anthea hurriedly. “If you think I’m afraid, I’m
not.”

“I am though,” said Jane heavily; “I didn’t like it, and I won’t go
there again—not for anything I won’t.”

“We shouldn’t go _there_ again, silly,” said Cyril; “it would be some
other place.”

“I daresay; a place with lions and tigers in it as likely as not.”

Seeing Jane so frightened, made the others feel quite brave. They said
they were certain they ought to go.

“It’s so ungrateful to the Psammead not to,” Anthea added, a little
primly.

Jane stood up. She was desperate.

“I won’t!” she cried; “I won’t, I won’t, I won’t! If you make me I’ll
scream and I’ll scream, and I’ll tell old Nurse, and I’ll get her to
burn the charm in the kitchen fire. So now, then!”

You can imagine how furious everyone was with Jane for feeling what
each of them had felt all the morning. In each breast the same thought
arose, “No one can say it’s _our_ fault.” And they at once began to
show Jane how angry they all felt that all the fault was hers. This
made them feel quite brave.

“Tell-tale tit, its tongue shall be split,
And all the dogs in our town shall have a little bit,”


sang Robert.

“It’s always the way if you have girls in anything.” Cyril spoke in a
cold displeasure that was worse than Robert’s cruel quotation, and even
Anthea said, “Well, _I’m_ not afraid if I _am_ a girl,” which of
course, was the most cutting thing of all.

Jane picked up her doll and faced the others with what is sometimes
called the courage of despair.

“I don’t care,” she said; “I _won’t_, so there! It’s just silly going
to places when you don’t want to, and when you don’t know what they’re
going to be like! You can laugh at me as much as you like. You’re
beasts—and I hate you all!”

With these awful words she went out and banged the door.

Then the others would not look at each other, and they did not feel so
brave as they had done.

Cyril took up a book, but it was not interesting to read. Robert kicked
a chair-leg absently. His feet were always eloquent in moments of
emotion. Anthea stood pleating the end of the tablecloth into folds—she
seemed earnestly anxious to get all the pleats the same size. The sound
of Jane’s sobs had died away.

Suddenly Anthea said, “Oh! let it be ‘pax’—poor little Pussy—you know
she’s the youngest.”

“She called us beasts,” said Robert, kicking the chair suddenly.

“Well,” said Cyril, who was subject to passing fits of justice, “we
began, you know. At least you did.” Cyril’s justice was always
uncompromising.

“I’m not going to say I’m sorry if you mean that,” said Robert, and the
chair-leg cracked to the kick he gave as he said it.

“Oh, do let’s,” said Anthea, “we’re three to one, and Mother does so
hate it if we row. Come on. I’ll say I’m sorry first, though I didn’t
say anything, hardly.”

“All right, let’s get it over,” said Cyril, opening the
door.“Hi—you—Pussy!”

Far away up the stairs a voice could be heard singing brokenly, but
still defiantly—

“How many miles (sniff) to Babylon?
    Three score and ten! (sniff)
Can I get there by candle light?
    Yes (sniff), and back again!”


It was trying, for this was plainly meant to annoy. But Anthea would
not give herself time to think this. She led the way up the stairs,
taking three at a time, and bounded to the level of Jane, who sat on
the top step of all, thumping her doll to the tune of the song she was
trying to sing.

“I say, Pussy, let it be pax! We’re sorry if you are—”

It was enough. The kiss of peace was given by all. Jane being the
youngest was entitled to this ceremonial.

Anthea added a special apology of her own.

“I’m sorry if I was a pig, Pussy dear,” she said—“especially because in
my really and truly inside mind I’ve been feeling a little as if I’d
rather not go into the Past again either. But then, do think. If we
don’t go we shan’t get the Amulet, and oh, Pussy, think if we could
only get Father and Mother and The Lamb safe back! We _must_ go, but
we’ll wait a day or two if you like and then perhaps you’ll feel
braver.”

“Raw meat makes you brave, however cowardly you are,” said Robert, to
show that there was now no ill-feeling, “and cranberries—that’s what
Tartars eat, and they’re so brave it’s simply awful. I suppose
cranberries are only for Christmas time, but I’ll ask old Nurse to let
you have your chop very raw if you like.”

“I think I could be brave without that,” said Jane hastily; she hated
underdone meat. “I’ll try.”

At this moment the door of the learned gentleman’s room opened, and he
looked out.

“Excuse me,” he said, in that gentle, polite weary voice of his, “but
was I mistaken in thinking that I caught a familiar word just now? Were
you not singing some old ballad of Babylon?”

“No,” said Robert, “at least Jane was singing ‘How many miles,’ but I
shouldn’t have thought you could have heard the words for—”

He would have said, “for the sniffing,” but Anthea pinched him just in
time.

“I did not hear _all_ the words,” said the learned gentleman. “I wonder
would you recite them to me?”

So they all said together—

“How many miles to Babylon?
    Three score and ten!
Can I get there by candle light?
    Yes, and back again!”


“I wish one could,” the learned gentleman said with a sigh.

“Can’t you?” asked Jane.

“Babylon has fallen,” he answered with a sigh. “You know it was once a
great and beautiful city, and the centre of learning and Art, and now
it is only ruins, and so covered up with earth that people are not even
agreed as to where it once stood.”

He was leaning on the banisters, and his eyes had a far-away look in
them, as though he could see through the staircase window the splendour
and glory of ancient Babylon.

“I say,” Cyril remarked abruptly. “You know that charm we showed you,
and you told us how to say the name that’s on it?”

“Yes!”

“Well, do you think that charm was ever in Babylon?”

“It’s quite possible,” the learned gentleman replied. “Such charms have
been found in very early Egyptian tombs, yet their origin has not been
accurately determined as Egyptian. They may have been brought from
Asia. Or, supposing the charm to have been fashioned in Egypt, it might
very well have been carried to Babylon by some friendly embassy, or
brought back by the Babylonish army from some Egyptian campaign as part
of the spoils of war. The inscription may be much later than the charm.
Oh yes! it is a pleasant fancy, that that splendid specimen of yours
was once used amid Babylonish surroundings.”

The others looked at each other, but it was Jane who spoke.

“Were the Babylon people savages, were they always fighting and
throwing things about?” For she had read the thoughts of the others by
the unerring light of her own fears.

“The Babylonians were certainly more gentle than the Assyrians,” said
the learned gentleman. “And they were not savages by any means. A very
high level of culture,” he looked doubtfully at his audience and went
on, “I mean that they made beautiful statues and jewellery, and built
splendid palaces. And they were very learned—they had glorious
libraries and high towers for the purpose of astrological and
astronomical observation.”

“Er?” said Robert.

“I mean for—star-gazing and fortune-telling,” said the learned
gentleman, “and there were temples and beautiful hanging gardens—”

“I’ll go to Babylon if you like,” said Jane abruptly, and the others
hastened to say “Done!” before she should have time to change her mind.

“Ah,” said the learned gentleman, smiling rather sadly, “one can go so
far in dreams, when one is young.” He sighed again, and then adding
with a laboured briskness, “I hope you’ll have a—a—jolly game,” he went
into his room and shut the door.

“He said ‘jolly’ as if it was a foreign language,” said Cyril. “Come
on, let’s get the Psammead and go now. I think Babylon seems a most
frightfully jolly place to go to.”

So they woke the Psammead and put it in its bass-bag with the
waterproof sheet, in case of inclement weather in Babylon. It was very
cross, but it said it would as soon go to Babylon as anywhere else.
“The sand is good thereabouts,” it added.

Then Jane held up the charm, and Cyril said—

“We want to go to Babylon to look for the part of you that was lost.
Will you please let us go there through you?”

“Please put us down just outside,” said Jane hastily; “and then if we
don’t like it we needn’t go inside.”

“Don’t be all day,” said the Psammead.

So Anthea hastily uttered the word of power, without which the charm
could do nothing.

“Ur—Hekau—Setcheh!” she said softly, and as she spoke the charm grew
into an arch so tall that the top of it was close against the bedroom
ceiling. Outside the arch was the bedroom painted chest-of-drawers and
the Kidderminster carpet, and the washhand-stand with the riveted
willow-pattern jug, and the faded curtains, and the dull light of
indoors on a wet day. Through the arch showed the gleam of soft green
leaves and white blossoms. They stepped forward quite happily. Even
Jane felt that this did not look like lions, and her hand hardly
trembled at all as she held the charm for the others to go through, and
last, slipped through herself, and hung the charm, now grown small
again, round her neck.

The children found themselves under a white-blossomed, green-leafed
fruit-tree, in what seemed to be an orchard of such trees, all
white-flowered and green-foliaged. Among the long green grass under
their feet grew crocuses and lilies, and strange blue flowers. In the
branches overhead thrushes and blackbirds were singing, and the coo of
a pigeon came softly to them in the green quietness of the orchard.

“Oh, how perfectly lovely!” cried Anthea.

“Why, it’s like home exactly—I mean England—only everything’s bluer,
and whiter, and greener, and the flowers are bigger.”

The boys owned that it certainly was fairly decent, and even Jane
admitted that it was all very pretty.

“I’m certain there’s nothing to be frightened of here,” said Anthea.

“I don’t know,” said Jane. “I suppose the fruit-trees go on just the
same even when people are killing each other. I didn’t half like what
the learned gentleman said about the hanging gardens. I suppose they
have gardens on purpose to hang people in. I do hope this isn’t one.”

“Of course it isn’t,” said Cyril. “The hanging gardens are just gardens
hung up—_I_ think on chains between houses, don’t you know, like trays.
Come on; let’s get somewhere.”

They began to walk through the cool grass. As far as they could see was
nothing but trees, and trees and more trees. At the end of their
orchard was another one, only separated from theirs by a little stream
of clear water. They jumped this, and went on. Cyril, who was fond of
gardening—which meant that he liked to watch the gardener at work—was
able to command the respect of the others by telling them the names of
a good many trees. There were nut-trees and almond-trees, and apricots,
and fig-trees with their big five-fingered leaves. And every now and
then the children had to cross another brook.

“It’s like between the squares in _Through the Looking-glass_,” said
Anthea.

At last they came to an orchard which was quite different from the
other orchards. It had a low building in one corner.

“These are vines,” said Cyril superiorly, “and I know this is a
vineyard. I shouldn’t wonder if there was a wine-press inside that
place over there.”

At last they got out of the orchards and on to a sort of road, very
rough, and not at all like the roads you are used to. It had cypress
trees and acacia trees along it, and a sort of hedge of tamarisks, like
those you see on the road between Nice and Cannes, or near
Littlehampton, if you’ve only been as far as that.

And now in front of them they could see a great mass of buildings.
There were scattered houses of wood and stone here and there among
green orchards, and beyond these a great wall that shone red in the
early morning sun. The wall was enormously high—more than half the
height of St Paul’s—and in the wall were set enormous gates that shone
like gold as the rising sun beat on them. Each gate had a solid square
tower on each side of it that stood out from the wall and rose above
it. Beyond the wall were more towers and houses, gleaming with gold and
bright colours. Away to the left ran the steel-blue swirl of a great
river. And the children could see, through a gap in the trees, that the
river flowed out from the town under a great arch in the wall.

“Those feathery things along by the water are palms,” said Cyril
instructively.

“Oh, yes; you know everything,” Robert replied. “What’s all that
grey-green stuff you see away over there, where it’s all flat and
sandy?”

“All right,” said Cyril loftily, “_I_ don’t want to tell you anything.
I only thought you’d like to know a palm-tree when you saw it again.”

“Look!” cried Anthea; “they’re opening the gates.”

And indeed the great gates swung back with a brazen clang, and
instantly a little crowd of a dozen or more people came out and along
the road towards them.

The children, with one accord, crouched behind the tamarisk hedge.

“I don’t like the sound of those gates,” said Jane. “Fancy being inside
when they shut. You’d never get out.”

“You’ve got an arch of your own to go out by,” the Psammead put its
head out of the basket to remind her. “Don’t behave so like a girl. If
I were you I should just march right into the town and ask to see the
king.”

There was something at once simple and grand about this idea, and it
pleased everyone.

So when the work-people had passed (they _were_ work-people, the
children felt sure, because they were dressed so plainly—just one long
blue shirt thing—of blue or yellow) the four children marched boldly up
to the brazen gate between the towers. The arch above the gate was
quite a tunnel, the walls were so thick.

“Courage,” said Cyril. “Step out. It’s no use trying to sneak past. Be
bold!”

Robert answered this appeal by unexpectedly bursting into “The British
Grenadiers”, and to its quick-step they approached the gates of
Babylon.

“Some talk of Alexander,
    And some of Hercules,
Of Hector and Lysander,
    And such great names as these.
But of all the gallant heroes...”


This brought them to the threshold of the gate, and two men in bright
armour suddenly barred their way with crossed spears.

“Who goes there?” they said.

(I think I must have explained to you before how it was that the
children were always able to understand the language of any place they
might happen to be in, and to be themselves understood. If not, I have
no time to explain it now.)

“We come from very far,” said Cyril mechanically. “From the Empire
where the sun never sets, and we want to see your King.”

“If it’s quite convenient,” amended Anthea.

“The King (may he live for ever!),” said the gatekeeper, “is gone to
fetch home his fourteenth wife. Where on earth have you come from not
to know that?”

“The Queen then,” said Anthea hurriedly, and not taking any notice of
the question as to where they had come from.

“The Queen,” said the gatekeeper, “(may she live for ever!) gives
audience today three hours after sunrising.”

“But what are we to do till the end of the three hours?” asked Cyril.

The gatekeeper seemed neither to know nor to care. He appeared less
interested in them than they could have thought possible. But the man
who had crossed spears with him to bar the children’s way was more
human.

“Let them go in and look about them,” he said. “I’ll wager my best
sword they’ve never seen anything to come near our little—village.”

He said it in the tone people use for when they call the Atlantic Ocean
the “herring pond”.

The gatekeeper hesitated.

“They’re only children, after all,” said the other, who had children of
his own. “Let me off for a few minutes, Captain, and I’ll take them to
my place and see if my good woman can’t fit them up in something a
little less outlandish than their present rig. Then they can have a
look round without being mobbed. May I go?”

“Oh yes, if you like,” said the Captain, “but don’t be all day.”

The man led them through the dark arch into the town. And it was very
different from London. For one thing, everything in London seems to be
patched up out of odds and ends, but these houses seemed to have been
built by people who liked the same sort of things. Not that they were
all alike, for though all were squarish, they were of different sizes,
and decorated in all sorts of different ways, some with paintings in
bright colours, some with black and silver designs. There were
terraces, and gardens, and balconies, and open spaces with trees. Their
guide took them to a little house in a back street, where a kind-faced
woman sat spinning at the door of a very dark room.

“Here,” he said, “just lend these children a mantle each, so that they
can go about and see the place till the Queen’s audience begins. You
leave that wool for a bit, and show them round if you like. I must be
off now.”

The woman did as she was told, and the four children, wrapped in
fringed mantles, went with her all about the town, and oh! how I wish I
had time to tell you all that they saw. It was all so wonderfully
different from anything you have ever seen. For one thing, all the
houses were dazzlingly bright, and many of them covered with pictures.
Some had great creatures carved in stone at each side of the door. Then
the people—there were no black frock-coats and tall hats; no dingy
coats and skirts of good, useful, ugly stuffs warranted to wear.
Everyone’s clothes were bright and beautiful with blue and scarlet and
green and gold.

The market was brighter than you would think anything could be. There
were stalls for everything you could possibly want—and for a great many
things that if you wanted here and now, want would be your master.
There were pineapples and peaches in heaps—and stalls of crockery and
glass things, beautiful shapes and glorious colours, there were stalls
for necklaces, and clasps, and bracelets, and brooches, for woven
stuffs, and furs, and embroidered linen. The children had never seen
half so many beautiful things together, even at Liberty’s.

It seemed no time at all before the woman said—

“It’s nearly time now. We ought to be getting on towards the palace.
It’s as well to be early.”

So they went to the palace, and when they got there it was more
splendid than anything they had seen yet.

For it was glowing with colours, and with gold and silver and black and
white—like some magnificent embroidery. Flight after flight of broad
marble steps led up to it, and at the edges of the stairs stood great
images, twenty times as big as a man—images of men with wings like
chain armour, and hawks’ heads, and winged men with the heads of dogs.
And there were the statues of great kings.

Between the flights of steps were terraces where fountains played, and
the Queen’s Guard in white and scarlet, and armour that shone like
gold, stood by twos lining the way up the stairs; and a great body of
them was massed by the vast door of the palace itself, where it stood
glittering like an impossibly radiant peacock in the noon-day sun.

All sorts of people were passing up the steps to seek audience of the
Queen. Ladies in richly-embroidered dresses with fringy flounces, poor
folks in plain and simple clothes, dandies with beards oiled and
curled.

And Cyril, Robert, Anthea and Jane, went with the crowd.

At the gate of the palace the Psammead put one eye cautiously out of
the basket and whispered—

“I can’t be bothered with queens. I’ll go home with this lady. I’m sure
she’ll get me some sand if you ask her to.”

“Oh! don’t leave us,” said Jane. The woman was giving some last
instructions in Court etiquette to Anthea, and did not hear Jane.

“Don’t be a little muff,” said the Psammead quite fiercely. “It’s not a
bit of good your having a charm. You never use it. If you want me
you’ve only got to say the name of power and ask the charm to bring me
to you.”

“I’d rather go with you,” said Jane. And it was the most surprising
thing she had ever said in her life.

Everyone opened its mouth without thinking of manners, and Anthea, who
was peeping into the Psammead’s basket, saw that its mouth opened wider
than anybody’s.

“You needn’t gawp like that,” Jane went on. “I’m not going to be
bothered with queens any more than IT is. And I know, wherever it is,
it’ll take jolly good care that it’s safe.”

“She’s right there,” said everyone, for they had observed that the
Psammead had a way of knowing which side its bread was buttered.

She turned to the woman and said, “You’ll take me home with you, won’t
you? And let me play with your little girls till the others have done
with the Queen.”

“Surely I will, little heart!” said the woman.

And then Anthea hurriedly stroked the Psammead and embraced Jane, who
took the woman’s hand, and trotted contentedly away with the Psammead’s
bag under the other arm.

The others stood looking after her till she, the woman, and the basket
were lost in the many-coloured crowd. Then Anthea turned once more to
the palace’s magnificent doorway and said—

“Let’s ask the porter to take care of our Babylonian overcoats.”

So they took off the garments that the woman had lent them and stood
amid the jostling petitioners of the Queen in their own English frocks
and coats and hats and boots.

“We want to see the Queen,” said Cyril; “we come from the far Empire
where the sun never sets!”

A murmur of surprise and a thrill of excitement ran through the crowd.
The door-porter spoke to a black man, he spoke to someone else. There
was a whispering, waiting pause. Then a big man, with a cleanly-shaven
face, beckoned them from the top of a flight of red marble steps.

They went up; the boots of Robert clattering more than usual because he
was so nervous. A door swung open, a curtain was drawn back. A double
line of bowing forms in gorgeous raiment formed a lane that led to the
steps of the throne, and as the children advanced hurriedly there came
from the throne a voice very sweet and kind.

“Three children from the land where the sun never sets! Let them draw
hither without fear.”

In another minute they were kneeling at the throne’s foot, saying, “O
Queen, live for ever!” exactly as the woman had taught them. And a
splendid dream-lady, all gold and silver and jewels and snowy drift of
veils, was raising Anthea, and saying—

“Don’t be frightened, I really am _so_ glad you came! The land where
the sun never sets! I am delighted to see you! I was getting quite too
dreadfully bored for anything!”

And behind Anthea the kneeling Cyril whispered in the ears of the
respectful Robert—

“Bobs, don’t say anything to Panther. It’s no use upsetting her, but we
didn’t ask for Jane’s address, and the Psammead’s with her.”

“Well,” whispered Robert, “the charm can bring them to us at any
moment. _It_ said so.”

“Oh, yes,” whispered Cyril, in miserable derision, “_we’re_ all right,
of course. So we are! Oh, yes! If we’d only _got_ the charm.”

Then Robert saw, and he murmured, “Crikey!” at the foot of the throne
of Babylon; while Cyril hoarsely whispered the plain English fact—

“Jane’s got the charm round her neck, you silly cuckoo.”

“Crikey!” Robert repeated in heart-broken undertones.




CHAPTER VII.
“THE DEEPEST DUNGEON BELOW THE CASTLE MOAT”


The Queen threw three of the red and gold embroidered cushions off the
throne on to the marble steps that led up to it.

“Just make yourselves comfortable there,” she said. “I’m simply dying
to talk to you, and to hear all about your wonderful country and how
you got here, and everything, but I have to do justice every morning.
Such a bore, isn’t it? Do you do justice in your own country?”

“No,” said Cyril; “at least of course we try to, but not in this public
sort of way, only in private.”

“Ah, yes,” said the Queen, “I should much prefer a private audience
myself—much easier to manage. But public opinion has to be considered.
Doing justice is very hard work, even when you’re brought up to it.”

“We don’t do justice, but we have to do scales, Jane and me,” said
Anthea, “twenty minutes a day. It’s simply horrid.”

“What are scales?” asked the Queen, “and what is Jane?”

“Jane is my little sister. One of the guards-at-the-gate’s wife is
taking care of her. And scales are music.”

“I never heard of the instrument,” said the Queen. “Do you sing?”

“Oh, yes. We can sing in parts,” said Anthea.

“That _is_ magic,” said the Queen. “How many parts are you each cut
into before you do it?”

“We aren’t cut at all,” said Robert hastily. “We couldn’t sing if we
were. We’ll show you afterwards.”

“So you shall, and now sit quiet like dear children and hear me do
justice. The way I do it has always been admired. I oughtn’t to say
that, ought I? Sounds so conceited. But I don’t mind with you, dears.
Somehow I feel as though I’d known you quite a long time already.”

The Queen settled herself on her throne and made a signal to her
attendants. The children, whispering together among the cushions on the
steps of the throne, decided that she was very beautiful and very kind,
but perhaps just the least bit flighty.

The first person who came to ask for justice was a woman whose brother
had taken the money the father had left for her. The brother said it
was the uncle who had the money. There was a good deal of talk and the
children were growing rather bored, when the Queen suddenly clapped her
hands, and said—

“Put both the men in prison till one of them owns up that the other is
innocent.”

“But suppose they both did it?” Cyril could not help interrupting.

“Then prison’s the best place for them,” said the Queen.

“But suppose neither did it.”

“That’s impossible,” said the Queen; “a thing’s not done unless someone
does it. And you mustn’t interrupt.”

Then came a woman, in tears, with a torn veil and real ashes on her
head—at least Anthea thought so, but it may have been only road-dust.
She complained that her husband was in prison.

“What for?” said the Queen.

“They _said_ it was for speaking evil of your Majesty,” said the woman,
“but it wasn’t. Someone had a spite against him. That was what it was.”

“How do you know he hadn’t spoken evil of me?” said the Queen.

“No one could,” said the woman simply, “when they’d once seen your
beautiful face.”

“Let the man out,” said the Queen, smiling. “Next case.”

The next case was that of a boy who had stolen a fox. “Like the Spartan
boy,” whispered Robert. But the Queen ruled that nobody could have any
possible reason for owning a fox, and still less for stealing one. And
she did not believe that there were any foxes in Babylon; she, at any
rate, had never seen one. So the boy was released.

The people came to the Queen about all sorts of family quarrels and
neighbourly misunderstandings—from a fight between brothers over the
division of an inheritance, to the dishonest and unfriendly conduct of
a woman who had borrowed a cooking-pot at the last New Year’s festival,
and not returned it yet.

And the Queen decided everything, very, very decidedly indeed. At last
she clapped her hands quite suddenly and with extreme loudness, and
said—

“The audience is over for today.”

Everyone said, “May the Queen live for ever!” and went out.

And the children were left alone in the justice-hall with the Queen of
Babylon and her ladies.

“There!” said the Queen, with a long sigh of relief. “_That’s_ over! I
couldn’t have done another stitch of justice if you’d offered me the
crown of Egypt! Now come into the garden, and we’ll have a nice, long,
cosy talk.”

She led them through long, narrow corridors whose walls they somehow
felt, were very, very thick, into a sort of garden courtyard. There
were thick shrubs closely planted, and roses were trained over
trellises, and made a pleasant shade—needed, indeed, for already the
sun was as hot as it is in England in August at the seaside.

Slaves spread cushions on a low, marble terrace, and a big man with a
smooth face served cool drink in cups of gold studded with beryls. He
drank a little from the Queen’s cup before handing it to her.

“That’s rather a nasty trick,” whispered Robert, who had been carefully
taught never to drink out of one of the nice, shiny, metal cups that
are chained to the London drinking fountains without first rinsing it
out thoroughly.

The Queen overheard him.

“Not at all,” said she. “Ritti-Marduk is a very clean man. And one has
to have _someone_ as taster, you know, because of poison.”

The word made the children feel rather creepy; but Ritti-Marduk had
tasted all the cups, so they felt pretty safe. The drink was
delicious—very cold, and tasting like lemonade and partly like penny
ices.

“Leave us,” said the Queen. And all the Court ladies, in their
beautiful, many-folded, many-coloured, fringed dresses, filed out
slowly, and the children were left alone with the Queen.

“Now,” she said, “tell me all about yourselves.”

They looked at each other.

“You, Bobs,” said Cyril.

“No—Anthea,” said Robert.

“No—you—Cyril,” said Anthea. “Don’t you remember how pleased the Queen
of India was when you told her all about us?”

Cyril muttered that it was all very well, and so it was. For when he
had told the tale of the Phœnix and the Carpet to the Ranee, it had
been only the truth—and all the truth that he had to tell. But now it
was not easy to tell a convincing story without mentioning the
Amulet—which, of course, it wouldn’t have done to mention—and without
owning that they were really living in London, about 2,500 years later
than the time they were talking in.

Cyril took refuge in the tale of the Psammead and its wonderful power
of making wishes come true. The children had never been able to tell
anyone before, and Cyril was surprised to find that the spell which
kept them silent in London did not work here. “Something to do with our
being in the Past, I suppose,” he said to himself.

“This is _most_ interesting,” said the Queen. “We must have this
Psammead for the banquet tonight. Its performance will be one of the
most popular turns in the whole programme. Where is it?”

Anthea explained that they did not know; also why it was that they did
not know.

“Oh, _that’s_ quite simple,” said the Queen, and everyone breathed a
deep sigh of relief as she said it. “Ritti-Marduk shall run down to the
gates and find out which guard your sister went home with.”

“Might he”—Anthea’s voice was tremulous—“might he—would it interfere
with his meal-times, or anything like that, if he went _now?_”

“Of course he shall go now. He may think himself lucky if he gets his
meals at any time,” said the Queen heartily, and clapped her hands.

“May I send a letter?” asked Cyril, pulling out a red-backed penny
account-book, and feeling in his pockets for a stump of pencil that he
_knew_ was in one of them.

“By all means. I’ll call my scribe.”

“Oh, I can scribe right enough, thanks,” said Cyril, finding the pencil
and licking its point. He even had to bite the wood a little, for it
was very blunt.

“Oh, you clever, clever boy!” said the Queen. “_do_ let me watch you do
it!”

Cyril wrote on a leaf of the book—it was of rough, woolly paper, with
hairs that stuck out and would have got in his pen if he had been using
one, and ruled for accounts.

“Hide IT most carefully before you come here,” he wrote, “and don’t
mention it—and destroy this letter. Everything is going A1. The Queen
is a fair treat. There’s nothing to be afraid of.”

“What curious characters, and what a strange flat surface!” said the
Queen. “What have you inscribed?”

“I’ve “scribed,” replied Cyril cautiously, “that you are fair, and
a—and like a—like a festival; and that she need not be afraid, and that
she is to come at once.”

Ritti-Marduk, who had come in and had stood waiting while Cyril wrote,
his Babylonish eyes nearly starting out of his Babylonish head, now
took the letter, with some reluctance.

“O Queen, live for ever! Is it a charm?” he timidly asked. “A strong
charm, most great lady?”

“_Yes_,” said Robert, unexpectedly, “it _is_ a charm, but it won’t hurt
anyone until you’ve given it to Jane. And then she’ll destroy it, so
that it _can’t_ hurt anyone. It’s most awful strong!—as strong
as—Peppermint!” he ended abruptly.

“I know not the god,” said Ritti-Marduk, bending timorously.

“She’ll tear it up directly she gets it,” said Robert, “That’ll end the
charm. You needn’t be afraid if you go now.”

Ritti-Marduk went, seeming only partly satisfied; and then the Queen
began to admire the penny account-book and the bit of pencil in so
marked and significant a way that Cyril felt he could not do less than
press them upon her as a gift. She ruffled the leaves delightedly.

“What a wonderful substance!” she said. “And with this style you make
charms? Make a charm for me! Do you know,” her voice sank to a whisper,
“the names of the great ones of your own far country?”

“Rather!” said Cyril, and hastily wrote the names of Alfred the Great,
Shakespeare, Nelson, Gordon, Lord Beaconsfield, Mr Rudyard Kipling, and
Mr Sherlock Holmes, while the Queen watched him with “unbaited breath”,
as Anthea said afterwards.

She took the book and hid it reverently among the bright folds of her
gown.

“You shall teach me later to say the great names,” she said. “And the
names of their Ministers—perhaps the great Nisroch is one of them?”

“I don’t think so,” said Cyril. “Mr Campbell Bannerman’s Prime Minister
and Mr Burns a Minister, and so is the Archbishop of Canterbury, I
think, but I’m not sure—and Dr Parker was one, I know, and—”

“No more,” said the Queen, putting her hands to her ears. “My head’s
going round with all those great names. You shall teach them to me
later—because of course you’ll make us a nice long visit now you have
come, won’t you? Now tell me—but no, I am quite tired out with your
being so clever. Besides, I’m sure you’d like _me_ to tell _you_
something, wouldn’t you?”

“Yes,” said Anthea. “I want to know how it is that the King has gone—”

“Excuse me, but you should say ‘the King may-he-live-for-ever’,” said
the Queen gently.

“I beg your pardon,” Anthea hastened to say—“the King
may-he-live-for-ever has gone to fetch home his fourteenth wife? I
don’t think even Bluebeard had as many as that. And, besides, he hasn’t
killed _you_ at any rate.”

The Queen looked bewildered.

“She means,” explained Robert, “that English kings only have one
wife—at least, Henry the Eighth had seven or eight, but not all at
once.”

“In our country,” said the Queen scornfully, “a king would not reign a
day who had only one wife. No one would respect him, and quite right
too.”

“Then are all the other thirteen alive?” asked Anthea.

“Of course they are—poor mean-spirited things! I don’t associate with
them, of course, I am the Queen: they’re only the wives.”

“I see,” said Anthea, gasping.

“But oh, my dears,” the Queen went on, “such a to-do as there’s been
about this last wife! You never did! It really was _too_ funny. We
wanted an Egyptian princess. The King may-he-live-for-ever has got a
wife from most of the important nations, and he had set his heart on an
Egyptian one to complete his collection. Well, of course, to begin
with, we sent a handsome present of gold. The Egyptian king sent back
some horses—quite a few; he’s fearfully stingy!—and he said he liked
the gold very much, but what they were really short of was lapis
lazuli, so of course we sent him some. But by that time he’d begun to
use the gold to cover the beams of the roof of the Temple of the
Sun-God, and he hadn’t nearly enough to finish the job, so we sent some
more. And so it went on, oh, for years. You see each journey takes at
least six months. And at last we asked the hand of his daughter in
marriage.”

“Yes, and then?” said Anthea, who wanted to get to the princess part of
the story.

“Well, then,” said the Queen, “when he’d got everything out of us that
he could, and only given the meanest presents in return, he sent to say
he would esteem the honour of an alliance very highly, only
unfortunately he hadn’t any daughter, but he hoped one would be born
soon, and if so, she should certainly be reserved for the King of
Babylon!”

“What a trick!” said Cyril.

“Yes, wasn’t it? So then we said his sister would do, and then there
were more gifts and more journeys; and now at last the tiresome,
black-haired thing is coming, and the King may-he-live-for-ever has
gone seven days’ journey to meet her at Carchemish. And he’s gone in
his best chariot, the one inlaid with lapis lazuli and gold, with the
gold-plated wheels and onyx-studded hubs—much too great an honour in my
opinion. She’ll be here tonight; there’ll be a grand banquet to
celebrate her arrival. _She_ won’t be present, of course. She’ll be
having her baths and her anointings, and all that sort of thing. We
always clean our foreign brides very carefully. It takes two or three
weeks. Now it’s dinnertime, and you shall eat with me, for I can see
that you are of high rank.”

She led them into a dark, cool hall, with many cushions on the floor.
On these they sat and low tables were brought—beautiful tables of
smooth, blue stone mounted in gold. On these, golden trays were placed;
but there were no knives, or forks, or spoons. The children expected
the Queen to call for them; but no. She just ate with her fingers, and
as the first dish was a great tray of boiled corn, and meat and raisins
all mixed up together, and melted fat poured all over the tray, it was
found difficult to follow her example with anything like what we are
used to think of as good table manners. There were stewed quinces
afterwards, and dates in syrup, and thick yellowy cream. It was the
kind of dinner you hardly ever get in Fitzroy Street.

After dinner everybody went to sleep, even the children.

The Queen awoke with a start.

“Good gracious!” she cried, “what a time we’ve slept! I must rush off
and dress for the banquet. I shan’t have much more than time.”

“Hasn’t Ritti-Marduk got back with our sister and the Psammead yet?”
Anthea asked.

“I _quite_ forgot to ask. I’m sorry,” said the Queen. “And of course
they wouldn’t announce her unless I told them to, except during justice
hours. I expect she’s waiting outside. I’ll see.”

Ritti-Marduk came in a moment later.

“I regret,” he said, “that I have been unable to find your sister. The
beast she bears with her in a basket has bitten the child of the guard,
and your sister and the beast set out to come to you. The police say
they have a clue. No doubt we shall have news of her in a few weeks.”
He bowed and withdrew.

The horror of this threefold loss—Jane, the Psammead, and the
Amulet—gave the children something to talk about while the Queen was
dressing. I shall not report their conversation; it was very gloomy.
Everyone repeated himself several times, and the discussion ended in
each of them blaming the other two for having let Jane go. You know the
sort of talk it was, don’t you? At last Cyril said—

“After all, she’s with the Psammead, so _she’s_ all right. The Psammead
is jolly careful of itself too. And it isn’t as if we were in any
danger. Let’s try to buck up and enjoy the banquet.”

They did enjoy the banquet. They had a beautiful bath, which was
delicious, were heavily oiled all over, including their hair, and that
was most unpleasant. Then, they dressed again and were presented to the
King, who was most affable. The banquet was long; there were all sorts
of nice things to eat, and everybody seemed to eat and drink a good
deal. Everyone lay on cushions and couches, ladies on one side and
gentlemen on the other; and after the eating was done each lady went
and sat by some gentleman, who seemed to be her sweetheart or her
husband, for they were very affectionate to each other. The Court
dresses had gold threads woven in them, very bright and beautiful.

The middle of the room was left clear, and different people came and
did amusing things. There were conjurers and jugglers and
snake-charmers, which last Anthea did not like at all.

When it got dark torches were lighted. Cedar splinters dipped in oil
blazed in copper dishes set high on poles.

Then there was a dancer, who hardly danced at all, only just struck
attitudes. She had hardly any clothes, and was not at all pretty. The
children were rather bored by her, but everyone else was delighted,
including the King.

“By the beard of Nimrod!” he cried, “ask what you like girl, and you
shall have it!”

“I want nothing,” said the dancer; “the honour of having pleased the
King may-he-live-for-ever is reward enough for me.”

And the King was so pleased with this modest and sensible reply that he
gave her the gold collar off his own neck.

“I say!” said Cyril, awed by the magnificence of the gift.

“It’s all right,” whispered the Queen, “it’s not his best collar by any
means. We always keep a stock of cheap jewellery for these occasions.
And now—you promised to sing us something. Would you like my minstrels
to accompany you?”

“No, thank you,” said Anthea quickly. The minstrels had been playing
off and on all the time, and their music reminded Anthea of the band
she and the others had once had on the fifth of November—with penny
horns, a tin whistle, a tea-tray, the tongs, a policeman’s rattle, and
a toy drum. They had enjoyed this band very much at the time. But it
was quite different when someone else was making the same kind of
music. Anthea understood now that Father had not been really heartless
and unreasonable when he had told them to stop that infuriating din.

“What shall we sing?” Cyril was asking.

“Sweet and low?” suggested Anthea.

“Too soft—I vote for ‘Who will o’er the downs’. Now then—one, two,
three.

“Oh, who will o’er the downs so free,
    Oh, who will with me ride,
Oh, who will up and follow me,
    To win a blooming bride?

Her father he has locked the door,
    Her mother keeps the key;
But neither bolt nor bar shall keep
    My own true love from me.”


Jane, the alto, was missing, and Robert, unlike the mother of the lady
in the song, never could “keep the key”, but the song, even so, was
sufficiently unlike anything any of them had ever heard to rouse the
Babylonian Court to the wildest enthusiasm.

“More, more,” cried the King; “by my beard, this savage music is a new
thing. Sing again!”

So they sang:

“I saw her bower at twilight gray,
    ’Twas guarded safe and sure.
I saw her bower at break of day,
    ’Twas guarded then no more.

The varlets they were all asleep,
    And there was none to see
The greeting fair that passed there
    Between my love and me.”


Shouts of applause greeted the ending of the verse, and the King would
not be satisfied till they had sung all their part-songs (they only
knew three) twice over, and ended up with “Men of Harlech” in unison.
Then the King stood up in his royal robes with his high, narrow crown
on his head and shouted—

“By the beak of Nisroch, ask what you will, strangers from the land
where the sun never sets!”

“We ought to say it’s enough honour, like the dancer did,” whispered
Anthea.

“No, let’s ask for _It_,” said Robert.

“No, no, I’m sure the other’s manners,” said Anthea. But Robert, who
was excited by the music, and the flaring torches, and the applause and
the opportunity, spoke up before the others could stop him.

“Give us the half of the Amulet that has on it the name UR HEKAU
SETCHEH,” he said, adding as an afterthought, “O King, live-for-ever.”

As he spoke the great name those in the pillared hall fell on their
faces, and lay still. All but the Queen who crouched amid her cushions
with her head in her hands, and the King, who stood upright, perfectly
still, like the statue of a king in stone. It was only for a moment
though. Then his great voice thundered out—

“Guard, seize them!”

Instantly, from nowhere as it seemed, sprang eight soldiers in bright
armour inlaid with gold, and tunics of red and white. Very splendid
they were, and very alarming.

“Impious and sacrilegious wretches!” shouted the King. “To the dungeons
with them! We will find a way, tomorrow, to make them speak. For
without doubt they can tell us where to find the lost half of _It_.”

A wall of scarlet and white and steel and gold closed up round the
children and hurried them away among the many pillars of the great
hall. As they went they heard the voices of the courtiers loud in
horror.

“You’ve done it this time,” said Cyril with extreme bitterness.

“Oh, it will come right. It _must_. It always does,” said Anthea
desperately.

They could not see where they were going, because the guard surrounded
them so closely, but the ground under their feet, smooth marble at
first, grew rougher like stone, then it was loose earth and sand, and
they felt the night air. Then there was more stone, and steps down.

“It’s my belief we really _are_ going to the deepest dungeon below the
castle moat this time,” said Cyril.

And they were. At least it was not below a moat, but below the river
Euphrates, which was just as bad if not worse. In a most unpleasant
place it was. Dark, very, very damp, and with an odd, musty smell
rather like the shells of oysters. There was a torch—that is to say, a
copper basket on a high stick with oiled wood burning in it. By its
light the children saw that the walls were green, and that trickles of
water ran down them and dripped from the roof. There were things on the
floor that looked like newts, and in the dark corners creepy, shiny
things moved sluggishly, uneasily, horribly.

Robert’s heart sank right into those really reliable boots of his.
Anthea and Cyril each had a private struggle with that inside
disagreeableness which is part of all of us, and which is sometimes
called the Old Adam—and both were victors. Neither of them said to
Robert (and both tried hard not even to think it), “This is _your_
doing.” Anthea had the additional temptation to add, “I told you so.”
And she resisted it successfully.

“Sacrilege, and impious cheek,” said the captain of the guard to the
gaoler. “To be kept during the King’s pleasure. I expect he means to
get some pleasure out of them tomorrow! He’ll tickle them up!”

“Poor little kids,” said the gaoler.

“Oh, yes,” said the captain. “I’ve got kids of my own too. But it
doesn’t do to let domestic sentiment interfere with one’s public
duties. Good night.”

The soldiers tramped heavily off in their white and red and steel and
gold. The gaoler, with a bunch of big keys in his hand, stood looking
pityingly at the children. He shook his head twice and went out.

“Courage!” said Anthea. “I know it will be all right. It’s only a dream
_really_, you know. It _must_ be! I don’t believe about time being only
a something or other of thought. It _is_ a dream, and we’re bound to
wake up all right and safe.”

“Humph,” said Cyril bitterly. And Robert suddenly said—

“It’s all my doing. If it really is all up do please not keep a down on
me about it, and tell Father—Oh, I forgot.”

What he had forgotten was that his father was 3,000 miles and 5,000 or
more years away from him.

“All right, Bobs, old man,” said Cyril; and Anthea got hold of Robert’s
hand and squeezed it.

Then the gaoler came back with a platter of hard, flat cakes made of
coarse grain, very different from the cream-and-juicy-date feasts of
the palace; also a pitcher of water.

“There,” he said.

“Oh, thank you so very much. You _are_ kind,” said Anthea feverishly.

“Go to sleep,” said the gaoler, pointing to a heap of straw in a
corner; “tomorrow comes soon enough.”

“Oh, dear Mr Gaoler,” said Anthea, “whatever will they do to us
tomorrow?”

“They’ll try to make you tell things,” said the gaoler grimly, “and my
advice is if you’ve nothing to tell, make up something. Then perhaps
they’ll sell you to the Northern nations. Regular savages _they_ are.
Good night.”

“Good night,” said three trembling voices, which their owners strove in
vain to render firm. Then he went out, and the three were left alone in
the damp, dim vault.

“I know the light won’t last long,” said Cyril, looking at the
flickering brazier.

“Is it any good, do you think, calling on the name when we haven’t got
the charm?” suggested Anthea.

“I shouldn’t think so. But we might try.”

So they tried. But the blank silence of the damp dungeon remained
unchanged.

“What was the name the Queen said?” asked Cyril suddenly.
“Nisbeth—Nesbit—something? You know, the slave of the great names?”

“Wait a sec,” said Robert, “though I don’t know why you want it.
Nusroch—Nisrock—Nisroch—that’s it.”

Then Anthea pulled herself together. All her muscles tightened, and the
muscles of her mind and soul, if you can call them that, tightened too.

“UR HEKAU SETCHEH,” she cried in a fervent voice. “Oh, Nisroch, servant
of the Great Ones, come and help us!”

There was a waiting silence. Then a cold, blue light awoke in the
corner where the straw was—and in the light they saw coming towards
them a strange and terrible figure. I won’t try to describe it, because
the drawing shows it, exactly as it was, and exactly as the old
Babylonians carved it on their stones, so that you can see it in our
own British Museum at this day. I will just say that it had eagle’s
wings and an eagle’s head and the body of a man.

It came towards them, strong and unspeakably horrible.

“Oh, go away,” cried Anthea; but Cyril cried, “No; stay!”

The creature hesitated, then bowed low before them on the damp floor of
the dungeon.

“Speak,” it said, in a harsh, grating voice like large rusty keys being
turned in locks. “The servant of the Great Ones is _your_ servant. What
is your need that you call on the name of Nisroch?”

“We want to go home,” said Robert.

“No, no,” cried Anthea; “we want to be where Jane is.”

Nisroch raised his great arm and pointed at the wall of the dungeon.
And, as he pointed, the wall disappeared, and instead of the damp,
green, rocky surface, there shone and glowed a room with rich hangings
of red silk embroidered with golden water-lilies, with cushioned
couches and great mirrors of polished steel; and in it was the Queen,
and before her, on a red pillow, sat the Psammead, its fur hunched up
in an irritated, discontented way. On a blue-covered couch lay Jane
fast asleep.

“Walk forward without fear,” said Nisroch. “Is there aught else that
the Servant of the great Name can do for those who speak that name?”

“No—oh, _no_,” said Cyril. “It’s all right now. Thanks ever so.”

“You are a dear,” cried Anthea, not in the least knowing what she was
saying. “Oh, thank you thank you. But _do_ go _now!_”

She caught the hand of the creature, and it was cold and hard in hers,
like a hand of stone.

“Go forward,” said Nisroch. And they went.

“Oh, my good gracious,” said the Queen as they stood before her. “How
did you get here? I _knew_ you were magic. I meant to let you out the
first thing in the morning, if I could slip away—but thanks be to
Dagon, you’ve managed it for yourselves. You must get away. I’ll wake
my chief lady and she shall call Ritti-Marduk, and he’ll let you out
the back way, and—”

“Don’t rouse anybody for goodness’ sake,” said Anthea, “except Jane,
and I’ll rouse her.”

She shook Jane with energy, and Jane slowly awoke.

“Ritti-Marduk brought them in hours ago, really,” said the Queen, “but
I wanted to have the Psammead all to myself for a bit. You’ll excuse
the little natural deception?—it’s part of the Babylonish character,
don’t you know? But I don’t want anything to happen to you. Do let me
rouse someone.”

“No, no, no,” said Anthea with desperate earnestness. She thought she
knew enough of what the Babylonians were like when they were roused.
“We can go by our own magic. And you will tell the King it wasn’t the
gaoler’s fault. It was Nisroch.”

“Nisroch!” echoed the Queen. “You are indeed magicians.”

Jane sat up, blinking stupidly.

“Hold _It_ up, and say the word,” cried Cyril, catching up the
Psammead, which mechanically bit him, but only very slightly.

“Which is the East?” asked Jane.

“Behind me,” said the Queen. “Why?”

“Ur Hekau Setcheh,” said Jane sleepily, and held up the charm.

And there they all were in the dining-room at 300, Fitzroy Street.

“Jane,” cried Cyril with great presence of mind, “go and get the plate
of sand down for the Psammead.”

Jane went.

“Look here!” he said quickly, as the sound of her boots grew less loud
on the stairs, “don’t let’s tell her about the dungeon and all that.
It’ll only frighten her so that she’ll never want to go anywhere else.”

“Righto!” said Cyril; but Anthea felt that she could not have said a
word to save her life.

“Why did you want to come back in such a hurry?” asked Jane, returning
with the plate of sand. “It was awfully jolly in Babylon, I think! I
liked it no end.”

“Oh, yes,” said Cyril carelessly. “It was jolly enough, of course, but
I thought we’d been there long enough. Mother always says you oughtn’t
to wear out your welcome!”




CHAPTER VIII.
THE QUEEN IN LONDON


“Now tell us what happened to you,” said Cyril to Jane, when he and the
others had told her all about the Queen’s talk and the banquet, and the
variety entertainment, carefully stopping short before the beginning of
the dungeon part of the story.

“It wasn’t much good going,” said Jane, “if you didn’t even try to get
the Amulet.”

“We found out it was no go,” said Cyril; “it’s not to be got in
Babylon. It was lost before that. We’ll go to some other jolly friendly
place, where everyone is kind and pleasant, and look for it there. Now
tell us about your part.”

“Oh,” said Jane, “the Queen’s man with the smooth face—what was his
name?”

“Ritti-Marduk,” said Cyril.

“Yes,” said Jane, “Ritti-Marduk, he came for me just after the Psammead
had bitten the guard-of-the-gate’s wife’s little boy, and he took me to
the Palace. And we had supper with the new little Queen from Egypt. She
is a dear—not much older than you. She told me heaps about Egypt. And
we played ball after supper. And then the Babylon Queen sent for me. I
like her too. And she talked to the Psammead and I went to sleep. And
then you woke me up. That’s all.”

The Psammead, roused from its sound sleep, told the same story.

“But,” it added, “what possessed you to tell that Queen that I could
give wishes? I sometimes think you were born without even the most
rudimentary imitation of brains.”

The children did not know the meaning of rudimentary, but it sounded a
rude, insulting word.

“I don’t see that we did any harm,” said Cyril sulkily.

“Oh, no,” said the Psammead with withering irony, “not at all! Of
course not! Quite the contrary! Exactly so! Only she happened to wish
that she might soon find herself in your country. And soon may mean any
moment.”

“Then it’s your fault,” said Robert, “because you might just as well
have made ‘soon’ mean some moment next year or next century.”

“That’s where you, as so often happens, make the mistake,” rejoined the
Sand-fairy. “_I_ couldn’t mean anything but what _she_ meant by ‘soon’.
It wasn’t my wish. And what she meant was the next time the King
happens to go out lion hunting. So she’ll have a whole day, and perhaps
two, to do as she wishes with. She doesn’t know about time only being a
mode of thought.”

“Well,” said Cyril, with a sigh of resignation, “we must do what we can
to give her a good time. She was jolly decent to us. I say, suppose we
were to go to St James’s Park after dinner and feed those ducks that we
never did feed. After all that Babylon and all those years ago, I feel
as if I should like to see something _real_, and _now_. You’ll come,
Psammead?”

“Where’s my priceless woven basket of sacred rushes?” asked the
Psammead morosely. “I can’t go out with nothing on. And I won’t, what’s
more.”

And then everybody remembered with pain that the bass bag had, in the
hurry of departure from Babylon, not been remembered.

“But it’s not so extra precious,” said Robert hastily. “You can get
them given to you for nothing if you buy fish in Farringdon Market.”

“Oh,” said the Psammead very crossly indeed, “so you presume on my
sublime indifference to the things of this disgusting modern world, to
fob me off with a travelling equipage that costs you nothing. Very
well, I shall go to sand. Please don’t wake me.”

And it went then and there to sand, which, as you know, meant to bed.
The boys went to St James’s Park to feed the ducks, but they went
alone.

Anthea and Jane sat sewing all the afternoon. They cut off half a yard
from each of their best green Liberty sashes. A towel cut in two formed
a lining; and they sat and sewed and sewed and sewed. What they were
making was a bag for the Psammead. Each worked at a half of the bag.
Jane’s half had four-leaved shamrocks embroidered on it. They were the
only things she could do (because she had been taught how at school,
and, fortunately, some of the silk she had been taught with was left
over). And even so, Anthea had to draw the pattern for her. Anthea’s
side of the bag had letters on it—worked hastily but affectionately in
chain stitch. They were something like this:

[Illustration]

She would have put “travelling carriage”, but she made the letters too
big, so there was no room. The bag was made _into_ a bag with old
Nurse’s sewing machine, and the strings of it were Anthea’s and Jane’s
best red hair ribbons.

At tea-time, when the boys had come home with a most unfavourable
report of the St James’s Park ducks, Anthea ventured to awaken the
Psammead, and to show it its new travelling bag.

“Humph,” it said, sniffing a little contemptuously, yet at the same
time affectionately, “it’s not so dusty.”

The Psammead seemed to pick up very easily the kind of things that
people said nowadays. For a creature that had in its time associated
with Megatheriums and Pterodactyls, its quickness was really wonderful.

“It’s more worthy of me,” it said, “than the kind of bag that’s given
away with a pound of plaice. When do you propose to take me out in it?”

“I should like a rest from taking you or us anywhere,” said Cyril. But
Jane said—

“I want to go to Egypt. I did like that Egyptian Princess that came to
marry the King in Babylon. She told me about the larks they have in
Egypt. And the cats. Do let’s go there. And I told her what the bird
things on the Amulet were like. And she said it was Egyptian writing.”

The others exchanged looks of silent rejoicing at the thought of their
cleverness in having concealed from Jane the terrors they had suffered
in the dungeon below the Euphrates.

“Egypt’s so nice too,” Jane went on, “because of Doctor Brewer’s
Scripture History. I would like to go there when Joseph was dreaming
those curious dreams, or when Moses was doing wonderful things with
snakes and sticks.”

“I don’t care about snakes,” said Anthea shuddering.

“Well, we needn’t be in at that part, but Babylon was lovely! We had
cream and sweet, sticky stuff. And I expect Egypt’s the same.”

There was a good deal of discussion, but it all ended in everybody’s
agreeing to Jane’s idea. And next morning directly after breakfast
(which was kippers and very nice) the Psammead was invited to get into
his travelling carriage.

The moment after it had done so, with stiff, furry reluctance, like
that of a cat when you want to nurse it, and its ideas are not the same
as yours, old Nurse came in.

“Well, chickies,” she said, “are you feeling very dull?”

“Oh, no, Nurse dear,” said Anthea; “we’re having a lovely time. We’re
just going off to see some old ancient relics.”

“Ah,” said old Nurse, “the Royal Academy, I suppose? Don’t go wasting
your money too reckless, that’s all.”

She cleared away the kipper bones and the tea-things, and when she had
swept up the crumbs and removed the cloth, the Amulet was held up and
the order given—just as Duchesses (and other people) give it to their
coachmen.

“To Egypt, please!” said Anthea, when Cyril had uttered the wonderful
Name of Power.

“When Moses was there,” added Jane.

And there, in the dingy Fitzroy Street dining-room, the Amulet grew
big, and it was an arch, and through it they saw a blue, blue sky and a
running river.

“No, stop!” said Cyril, and pulled down Jane’s hand with the Amulet in
it.

“What silly cuckoos we all are,” he said. “Of course we can’t go. We
daren’t leave home for a single minute now, for fear that minute should
be _the_ minute.”

“What minute be _what_ minute?” asked Jane impatiently, trying to get
her hand away from Cyril.

“The minute when the Queen of Babylon comes,” said Cyril. And then
everyone saw it.

For some days life flowed in a very slow, dusty, uneventful stream. The
children could never go out all at once, because they never knew when
the King of Babylon would go out lion hunting and leave his Queen free
to pay them that surprise visit to which she was, without doubt,
eagerly looking forward.

So they took it in turns, two and two, to go out and to stay in.

The stay-at-homes would have been much duller than they were but for
the new interest taken in them by the learned gentleman.

He called Anthea in one day to show her a beautiful necklace of purple
and gold beads.

“I saw one like that,” she said, “in—”

“In the British Museum, perhaps?”

“I like to call the place where I saw it Babylon,” said Anthea
cautiously.

“A pretty fancy,” said the learned gentleman, “and quite correct too,
because, as a matter of fact, these beads did come from Babylon.”

The other three were all out that day. The boys had been going to the
Zoo, and Jane had said so plaintively, “I’m sure I am fonder of
rhinoceroses than either of you are,” that Anthea had told her to run
along then. And she had run, catching the boys before that part of the
road where Fitzroy Street suddenly becomes Fitzroy Square.

“I think Babylon is most frightfully interesting,” said Anthea. “I do
have such interesting dreams about it—at least, not dreams exactly, but
quite as wonderful.”

“Do sit down and tell me,” said he. So she sat down and told. And he
asked her a lot of questions, and she answered them as well as she
could.

“Wonderful—wonderful!” he said at last. “One’s heard of
thought-transference, but I never thought _I_ had any power of that
sort. Yet it must be that, and very bad for _you_, I should think.
Doesn’t your head ache very much?”

He suddenly put a cold, thin hand on her forehead.

“No thank you, not at all,” said she.

“I assure you it is not done intentionally,” he went on. “Of course I
know a good deal about Babylon, and I unconsciously communicate it to
you; you’ve heard of thought-reading, but some of the things you say, I
don’t understand; they never enter my head, and yet they’re so
astoundingly probable.”

“It’s all right,” said Anthea reassuringly. “_I_ understand. And don’t
worry. It’s all quite simple really.”

It was not quite so simple when Anthea, having heard the others come
in, went down, and before she had had time to ask how they had liked
the Zoo, heard a noise outside, compared to which the wild beasts’
noises were gentle as singing birds.

“Good gracious!” cried Anthea, “what’s that?”

The loud hum of many voices came through the open window. Words could
be distinguished.

“’Ere’s a guy!”

“This ain’t November. That ain’t no guy. It’s a ballet lady, that’s
what it is.”

“Not it—it’s a bloomin’ looney, I tell you.”

Then came a clear voice that they knew.

“Retire, slaves!” it said.

“What’s she a saying of?” cried a dozen voices.

“Some blamed foreign lingo,” one voice replied.

The children rushed to the door. A crowd was on the road and pavement.

In the middle of the crowd, plainly to be seen from the top of the
steps, were the beautiful face and bright veil of the Babylonian Queen.

“Jimminy!” cried Robert, and ran down the steps, “here she is!”

“Here!” he cried, “look out—let the lady pass. She’s a friend of ours,
coming to see us.”

“Nice friend for a respectable house,” snorted a fat woman with marrows
on a handcart.

All the same the crowd made way a little. The Queen met Robert on the
pavement, and Cyril joined them, the Psammead bag still on his arm.

“Here,” he whispered; “here’s the Psammead; you can get wishes.”

“_I_ wish you’d come in a different dress, if you _had_ to come,” said
Robert; “but it’s no use my wishing anything.”

“No,” said the Queen. “I wish I was dressed—no, I don’t—I wish _they_
were dressed properly, then they wouldn’t be so silly.”

The Psammead blew itself out till the bag was a very tight fit for it;
and suddenly every man, woman, and child in that crowd felt that it had
not enough clothes on. For, of course, the Queen’s idea of proper dress
was the dress that had been proper for the working-classes 3,000 years
ago in Babylon—and there was not much of it.

“Lawky me!” said the marrow-selling woman, “whatever could a-took me to
come out this figure?” and she wheeled her cart away very quickly
indeed.

“Someone’s made a pretty guy of you—talk of guys,” said a man who sold
bootlaces.

“Well, don’t you talk,” said the man next to him. “Look at your own
silly legs; and where’s your boots?”

“I never come out like this, I’ll take my sacred,” said the
bootlace-seller. “I wasn’t quite myself last night, I’ll own, but not
to dress up like a circus.”

The crowd was all talking at once, and getting rather angry. But no one
seemed to think of blaming the Queen.

Anthea bounded down the steps and pulled her up; the others followed,
and the door was shut.

“Blowed if I can make it out!” they heard. “I’m off home, I am.”

And the crowd, coming slowly to the same mind, dispersed, followed by
another crowd of persons who were not dressed in what the Queen thought
was the proper way.

“We shall have the police here directly,” said Anthea in the tones of
despair. “Oh, why did you come dressed like that?”

The Queen leaned against the arm of the horse-hair sofa.

“How else can a queen dress I should like to know?” she questioned.

“Our Queen wears things like other people,” said Cyril.

“Well, I don’t. And I must say,” she remarked in an injured tone, “that
you don’t seem very glad to see me now I _have_ come. But perhaps it’s
the surprise that makes you behave like this. Yet you ought to be used
to surprises. The way you vanished! I shall never forget it. The best
magic I’ve ever seen. How did you do it?”

“Oh, never mind about that now,” said Robert. “You see you’ve gone and
upset all those people, and I expect they’ll fetch the police. And we
don’t want to see you collared and put in prison.”

“You can’t put queens in prison,” she said loftily.

“Oh, can’t you?” said Cyril. “We cut off a king’s head here once.”

“In this miserable room? How frightfully interesting.”

“No, no, not in this room; in history.”

“Oh, in _that_,” said the Queen disparagingly. “I thought you’d done it
with your own hands.”

The girls shuddered.

“What a hideous city yours is,” the Queen went on pleasantly, “and what
horrid, ignorant people. Do you know they actually can’t understand a
single word I say.”

“Can you understand them?” asked Jane.

“Of course not; they speak some vulgar, Northern dialect. I can
understand _you_ quite well.”

I really am not going to explain _again_ how it was that the children
could understand other languages than their own so thoroughly, and talk
them, too, so that it felt and sounded (to them) just as though they
were talking English.

“Well,” said Cyril bluntly, “now you’ve seen just how horrid it is,
don’t you think you might as well go home again?”

“Why, I’ve seen simply nothing yet,” said the Queen, arranging her
starry veil. “I wished to be at your door, and I was. Now I must go and
see your King and Queen.”

“Nobody’s allowed to,” said Anthea in haste; “but look here, we’ll take
you and show you anything you’d like to see—anything you _can_ see,”
she added kindly, because she remembered how nice the Queen had been to
them in Babylon, even if she had been a little deceitful in the matter
of Jane and Psammead.

“There’s the Museum,” said Cyril hopefully; “there are lots of things
from your country there. If only we could disguise you a little.”

“I know,” said Anthea suddenly. “Mother’s old theatre cloak, and there
are a lot of her old hats in the big box.”

The blue silk, lace-trimmed cloak did indeed hide some of the Queen’s
startling splendours, but the hat fitted very badly. It had pink roses
in it; and there was something about the coat or the hat or the Queen,
that made her look somehow not very respectable.

“Oh, never mind,” said Anthea, when Cyril whispered this. “The thing is
to get her out before Nurse has finished her forty winks. I should
think she’s about got to the thirty-ninth wink by now.”

“Come on then,” said Robert. “You know how dangerous it is. Let’s make
haste into the Museum. If any of those people you made guys of do fetch
the police, they won’t think of looking for you there.”

The blue silk coat and the pink-rosed hat attracted almost as much
attention as the royal costume had done; and the children were
uncommonly glad to get out of the noisy streets into the grey quiet of
the Museum.

“Parcels and umbrellas to be left here,” said a man at the counter.

The party had no umbrellas, and the only parcel was the bag containing
the Psammead, which the Queen had insisted should be brought.

“_I’m_ not going to be left,” said the Psammead softly, “so don’t you
think it.”

“I’ll wait outside with you,” said Anthea hastily, and went to sit on
the seat near the drinking fountain.

“Don’t sit so near that nasty fountain,” said the creature crossly; “I
might get splashed.”

Anthea obediently moved to another seat and waited. Indeed she waited,
and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited. The Psammead dropped
into an uneasy slumber. Anthea had long ceased to watch the swing-door
that always let out the wrong person, and she was herself almost
asleep, and still the others did not come back.

It was quite a start when Anthea suddenly realized that they _had_ come
back, and that they were not alone. Behind them was quite a crowd of
men in uniform, and several gentlemen were there. Everyone seemed very
angry.

“Now go,” said the nicest of the angry gentlemen. “Take the poor,
demented thing home and tell your parents she ought to be properly
looked after.”

“If you can’t get her to go we must send for the police,” said the
nastiest gentleman.

“But we don’t wish to use harsh measures,” added the nice one, who was
really very nice indeed, and seemed to be over all the others.

“May I speak to my sister a moment first?” asked Robert.

The nicest gentleman nodded, and the officials stood round the Queen,
the others forming a sort of guard while Robert crossed over to Anthea.

“Everything you can think of,” he replied to Anthea’s glance of
inquiry. “Kicked up the most frightful shine in there. Said those
necklaces and earrings and things in the glass cases were all
hers—would have them out of the cases. Tried to break the glass—she did
break one bit! Everybody in the place has been at her. No good. I only
got her out by telling her that was the place where they cut queens’
heads off.”

“Oh, Bobs, what a whacker!”

“You’d have told a whackinger one to get her out. Besides, it wasn’t. I
meant _mummy_ queens. How do you know they don’t cut off mummies’ heads
to see how the embalming is done? What I want to say is, can’t you get
her to go with you quietly?”

“I’ll try,” said Anthea, and went up to the Queen.

“Do come home,” she said; “the learned gentleman in our house has a
much nicer necklace than anything they’ve got here. Come and see it.”

The Queen nodded.

“You see,” said the nastiest gentleman, “she does understand English.”

“I was talking Babylonian, I think,” said Anthea bashfully.

“My good child,” said the nice gentleman, “what you’re talking is not
Babylonian, but nonsense. You just go home _at once_, and tell your
parents exactly what has happened.”

Anthea took the Queen’s hand and gently pulled her away. The other
children followed, and the black crowd of angry gentlemen stood on the
steps watching them. It was when the little party of disgraced
children, with the Queen who had disgraced them, had reached the middle
of the courtyard that her eyes fell on the bag where the Psammead was.
She stopped short.

“I wish,” she said, very loud and clear, “that all those Babylonian
things would come out to me here—slowly, so that those dogs and slaves
can see the working of the great Queen’s magic.”

“Oh, you _are_ a tiresome woman,” said the Psammead in its bag, but it
puffed itself out.

Next moment there was a crash. The glass swing doors and all their
framework were smashed suddenly and completely. The crowd of angry
gentlemen sprang aside when they saw what had done this. But the
nastiest of them was not quick enough, and he was roughly pushed out of
the way by an enormous stone bull that was floating steadily through
the door. It came and stood beside the Queen in the middle of the
courtyard.

It was followed by more stone images, by great slabs of carved stone,
bricks, helmets, tools, weapons, fetters, wine-jars, bowls, bottles,
vases, jugs, saucers, seals, and the round long things, something like
rolling pins with marks on them like the print of little bird-feet,
necklaces, collars, rings, armlets, earrings—heaps and heaps and heaps
of things, far more than anyone had time to count, or even to see
distinctly.

All the angry gentlemen had abruptly sat down on the Museum steps
except the nice one. He stood with his hands in his pockets just as
though he was quite used to seeing great stone bulls and all sorts of
small Babylonish objects float out into the Museum yard. But he sent a
man to close the big iron gates.

A journalist, who was just leaving the museum, spoke to Robert as he
passed.

“Theosophy, I suppose?” he said. “Is she Mrs Besant?”

“_Yes_,” said Robert recklessly.

The journalist passed through the gates just before they were shut. He
rushed off to Fleet Street, and his paper got out a new edition within
half an hour.

MRS BESANT AND THEOSOPHY

IMPERTINENT MIRACLE AT THE
BRITISH MUSEUM.


People saw it in fat, black letters on the boards carried by the
sellers of newspapers. Some few people who had nothing better to do
went down to the Museum on the tops of omnibuses. But by the time they
got there there was nothing to be seen. For the Babylonian Queen had
suddenly seen the closed gates, had felt the threat of them, and had
said—

“I wish we were in your house.”

And, of course, instantly they were.

The Psammead was furious.

“Look here,” it said, “they’ll come after you, and they’ll find _me_.
There’ll be a National Cage built for me at Westminster, and I shall
have to work at politics. Why wouldn’t you leave the things in their
places?”

“What a temper you have, haven’t you?” said the Queen serenely. “I wish
all the things were back in their places. Will _that_ do for you?”

The Psammead swelled and shrank and spoke very angrily.

“I can’t refuse to give your wishes,” it said, “but I can Bite. And I
will if this goes on. Now then.”

“Ah, don’t,” whispered Anthea close to its bristling ear; “it’s
dreadful for us too. Don’t _you_ desert us. Perhaps she’ll wish herself
at home again soon.”

“Not she,” said the Psammead a little less crossly.

“Take me to see your City,” said the Queen.

The children looked at each other.

“If we had some money we could take her about in a cab. People wouldn’t
notice her so much then. But we haven’t.”

“Sell this,” said the Queen, taking a ring from her finger.

“They’d only think we’d stolen it,” said Cyril bitterly, “and put us in
prison.”

“All roads lead to prison with you, it seems,” said the Queen.

“The learned gentleman!” said Anthea, and ran up to him with the ring
in her hand.

“Look here,” she said, “will you buy this for a pound?”

“Oh!” he said in tones of joy and amazement, and took the ring into his
hand.

“It’s my very own,” said Anthea; “it was given to me to sell.”

“I’ll lend you a pound,” said the learned gentleman, “with pleasure;
and I’ll take care of the ring for you. Who did you say gave it to
you?”

“We call her,” said Anthea carefully, “the Queen of Babylon.”

“Is it a game?” he asked hopefully.

“It’ll be a pretty game if I don’t get the money to pay for cabs for
her,” said Anthea.

“I sometimes think,” he said slowly, “that I am becoming insane, or
that—”

“Or that I am; but I’m not, and you’re not, and she’s not.”

“Does she _say_ that she’s the Queen of Babylon?” he uneasily asked.

“Yes,” said Anthea recklessly.

“This thought-transference is more far-reaching than I imagined,” he
said. “I suppose I have unconsciously influenced _her_, too. I never
thought my Babylonish studies would bear fruit like this. Horrible!
There are more things in heaven and earth—”

“Yes,” said Anthea, “heaps more. And the pound is the thing _I_ want
more than anything on earth.”

He ran his fingers through his thin hair.

“This thought-transference!” he said. “It’s undoubtedly a Babylonian
ring—or it seems so to me. But perhaps I have hypnotized myself. I will
see a doctor the moment I have corrected the last proofs of my book.”

“Yes, do!” said Anthea, “and thank you so very much.”

She took the sovereign and ran down to the others.

And now from the window of a four-wheeled cab the Queen of Babylon
beheld the wonders of London. Buckingham Palace she thought
uninteresting; Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament little
better. But she liked the Tower, and the River, and the ships filled
her with wonder and delight.

“But how badly you keep your slaves. How wretched and poor and
neglected they seem,” she said, as the cab rattled along the Mile End
Road.

“They aren’t slaves; they’re working-people,” said Jane.

“Of course they’re working. That’s what slaves are. Don’t you tell me.
Do you suppose I don’t know a slave’s face when I see it? Why don’t
their masters see that they’re better fed and better clothed? Tell me
in three words.”

No one answered. The wage-system of modern England is a little
difficult to explain in three words even if you understand it—which the
children didn’t.

“You’ll have a revolt of your slaves if you’re not careful,” said the
Queen.

“Oh, no,” said Cyril; “you see they have votes—that makes them safe not
to revolt. It makes all the difference. Father told me so.”

“What is this vote?” asked the Queen. “Is it a charm? What do they do
with it?”

“I don’t know,” said the harassed Cyril; “it’s just a vote, that’s all!
They don’t do anything particular with it.”

“I see,” said the Queen; “a sort of plaything. Well, I wish that all
these slaves may have in their hands this moment their fill of their
favourite meat and drink.”

Instantly all the people in the Mile End Road, and in all the other
streets where poor people live, found their hands full of things to eat
and drink. From the cab window could be seen persons carrying every
kind of food, and bottles and cans as well. Roast meat, fowls, red
lobsters, great yellowy crabs, fried fish, boiled pork, beef-steak
puddings, baked onions, mutton pies; most of the young people had
oranges and sweets and cake. It made an enormous change in the look of
the Mile End Road—brightened it up, so to speak, and brightened up,
more than you can possibly imagine, the faces of the people.

“Makes a difference, doesn’t it?” said the Queen.

“That’s the best wish you’ve had yet,” said Jane with cordial approval.

Just by the Bank the cabman stopped.

“I ain’t agoin’ to drive you no further,” he said. “Out you gets.”

They got out rather unwillingly.

“I wants my tea,” he said; and they saw that on the box of the cab was
a mound of cabbage, with pork chops and apple sauce, a duck, and a
spotted currant pudding. Also a large can.

“You pay me my fare,” he said threateningly, and looked down at the
mound, muttering again about his tea.

“We’ll take another cab,” said Cyril with dignity. “Give me change for
a sovereign, if you please.”

But the cabman, as it turned out, was not at all a nice character. He
took the sovereign, whipped up his horse, and disappeared in the stream
of cabs and omnibuses and wagons, without giving them any change at
all.

Already a little crowd was collecting round the party.

“Come on,” said Robert, leading the wrong way.

The crowd round them thickened. They were in a narrow street where many
gentlemen in black coats and without hats were standing about on the
pavement talking very loudly.

“How ugly their clothes are,” said the Queen of Babylon. “They’d be
rather fine men, some of them, if they were dressed decently,
especially the ones with the beautiful long, curved noses. I wish they
were dressed like the Babylonians of my court.”

And of course, it was so.

The moment the almost fainting Psammead had blown itself out every man
in Throgmorton Street appeared abruptly in Babylonian full dress.

All were carefully powdered, their hair and beards were scented and
curled, their garments richly embroidered. They wore rings and armlets,
flat gold collars and swords, and impossible-looking head-dresses.

A stupefied silence fell on them.

“I say,” a youth who had always been fair-haired broke that silence,
“it’s only fancy of course—something wrong with my eyes—but you chaps
do look so rum.”

“Rum,” said his friend. “Look at _you_. You in a sash! My hat! And your
hair’s gone black and you’ve got a beard. It’s my belief we’ve been
poisoned. You do look a jackape.”

“Old Levinstein don’t look so bad. But how was it _done_—that’s what I
want to know. How _was_ it done? Is it conjuring, or what?”

“I think it is chust a ver’ bad tream,” said old Levinstein to his
clerk; “all along Bishopsgate I haf seen the gommon people have their
hants full of food—_goot_ food. Oh yes, without doubt a very bad
tream!”

“Then I’m dreaming too, sir,” said the clerk, looking down at his legs
with an expression of loathing. “I see my feet in beastly sandals as
plain as plain.”

“All that goot food wasted,” said old Mr Levinstein. A bad tream—a bad
tream.”

The Members of the Stock Exchange are said to be at all times a noisy
lot. But the noise they made now to express their disgust at the
costumes of ancient Babylon was far louder than their ordinary row. One
had to shout before one could hear oneself speak.

“I only wish,” said the clerk who thought it was conjuring—he was quite
close to the children and they trembled, because they knew that
whatever he wished would come true. “I only wish we knew who’d done
it.”

And, of course, instantly they did know, and they pressed round the
Queen.

“Scandalous! Shameful! Ought to be put down by law. Give her in charge.
Fetch the police,” two or three voices shouted at once.

The Queen recoiled.

“What is it?” she asked. “They sound like caged lions—lions by the
thousand. What is it that they say?”

“They say ‘Police!’,” said Cyril briefly. “I knew they would sooner or
later. And I don’t blame them, mind you.”

“I wish my guards were here!” cried the Queen. The exhausted Psammead
was panting and trembling, but the Queen’s guards in red and green
garments, and brass and iron gear, choked Throgmorton Street, and bared
weapons flashed round the Queen.

“I’m mad,” said a Mr Rosenbaum; “dat’s what it is—mad!”

“It’s a judgement on you, Rosy,” said his partner. “I always said you
were too hard in that matter of Flowerdew. It’s a judgement, and I’m in
it too.”

The members of the Stock Exchange had edged carefully away from the
gleaming blades, the mailed figures, the hard, cruel Eastern faces. But
Throgmorton Street is narrow, and the crowd was too thick for them to
get away as quickly as they wished.

“Kill them,” cried the Queen. “Kill the dogs!”

The guards obeyed.

“It _is_ all a dream,” cried Mr Levinstein, cowering in a doorway
behind his clerk.

“It isn’t,” said the clerk. “It isn’t. Oh, my good gracious! those
foreign brutes are killing everybody. Henry Hirsh is down now, and
Prentice is cut in two—oh, Lord! and Huth, and there goes Lionel Cohen
with his head off, and Guy Nickalls has lost his head now. A dream? I
wish to goodness it was all a dream.”

And, of course, instantly it was! The entire Stock Exchange rubbed its
eyes and went back to close, to over, and either side of seven-eights,
and Trunks, and Kaffirs, and Steel Common, and Contangoes, and
Backwardations, Double Options, and all the interesting subjects
concerning which they talk in the Street without ceasing.

No one said a word about it to anyone else. I think I have explained
before that business men do not like it to be known that they have been
dreaming in business hours. Especially mad dreams including such
dreadful things as hungry people getting dinners, and the destruction
of the Stock Exchange.

The children were in the dining-room at 300, Fitzroy Street, pale and
trembling. The Psammead crawled out of the embroidered bag, and lay
flat on the table, its leg stretched out, looking more like a dead hare
than anything else.

“Thank Goodness that’s over,” said Anthea, drawing a deep breath.

“She won’t come back, will she?” asked Jane tremulously.

“No,” said Cyril. “She’s thousands of years ago. But we spent a whole
precious pound on her. It’ll take all our pocket-money for ages to pay
that back.”

“Not if it was _all_ a dream,” said Robert. “The wish said _all_ a
dream, you know, Panther; you cut up and ask if he lent you anything.”

“I beg your pardon,” said Anthea politely, following the sound of her
knock into the presence of the learned gentleman, “I’m _so_ sorry to
trouble you, but _did_ you lend me a pound today?”

“No,” said he, looking kindly at her through his spectacles. “But it’s
extraordinary that you should ask me, for I dozed for a few moments
this afternoon, a thing I very rarely do, and I dreamed quite
distinctly that you brought me a ring that you said belonged to the
Queen of Babylon, and that I lent you a sovereign and that you left one
of the Queen’s rings here. The ring was a magnificent specimen.” He
sighed. “I wish it hadn’t been a dream,” he said smiling. He was really
learning to smile quite nicely.

Anthea could not be too thankful that the Psammead was not there to
grant his wish.




CHAPTER IX.
ATLANTIS


You will understand that the adventure of the Babylonian queen in
London was the only one that had occupied any time at all. But the
children’s time was very fully taken up by talking over all the
wonderful things seen and done in the Past, where, by the power of the
Amulet, they seemed to spend hours and hours, only to find when they
got back to London that the whole thing had been briefer than a
lightning flash.

They talked of the Past at their meals, in their walks, in the
dining-room, in the first-floor drawing-room, but most of all on the
stairs. It was an old house; it had once been a fashionable one, and
was a fine one still. The banister rails of the stairs were excellent
for sliding down, and in the corners of the landings were big alcoves
that had once held graceful statues, and now quite often held the
graceful forms of Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane.

One day Cyril and Robert in tight white underclothing had spent a
pleasant hour in reproducing the attitudes of statues seen either in
the British Museum, or in Father’s big photograph book. But the show
ended abruptly because Robert wanted to be the Venus of Milo, and for
this purpose pulled at the sheet which served for drapery at the very
moment when Cyril, looking really quite like the Discobolos—with a gold
and white saucer for the disc—was standing on one foot, and under that
one foot was the sheet.

Of course the Discobolos and his disc and the would-be Venus came down
together, and everyone was a good deal hurt, especially the saucer,
which would never be the same again, however neatly one might join its
uneven bits with Seccotine or the white of an egg.

“I hope you’re satisfied,” said Cyril, holding his head where a large
lump was rising.

“Quite, thanks,” said Robert bitterly. His thumb had caught in the
banisters and bent itself back almost to breaking point.

“I _am_ so sorry, poor, dear Squirrel,” said Anthea; “and you were
looking so lovely. I’ll get a wet rag. Bobs, go and hold your hand
under the hot-water tap. It’s what ballet girls do with their legs when
they hurt them. I saw it in a book.”

“What book?” said Robert disagreeably. But he went.

When he came back Cyril’s head had been bandaged by his sisters, and he
had been brought to the state of mind where he was able reluctantly to
admit that he supposed Robert hadn’t done it on purpose.

Robert replying with equal suavity, Anthea hastened to lead the talk
away from the accident.

“I suppose you don’t feel like going anywhere through the Amulet,” she
said.

“Egypt!” said Jane promptly. “I want to see the pussy cats.”

“Not me—too hot,” said Cyril. “It’s about as much as I can stand
here—let alone Egypt.” It was indeed, hot, even on the second landing,
which was the coolest place in the house. “Let’s go to the North Pole.”

“I don’t suppose the Amulet was ever there—and we might get our fingers
frost-bitten so that we could never hold it up to get home again. No
thanks,” said Robert.

“I say,” said Jane, “let’s get the Psammead and ask its advice. It will
like us asking, even if we don’t take it.”

The Psammead was brought up in its green silk embroidered bag, but
before it could be asked anything the door of the learned gentleman’s
room opened and the voice of the visitor who had been lunching with him
was heard on the stairs. He seemed to be speaking with the door handle
in his hand.

“You see a doctor, old boy,” he said; “all that about
thought-transference is just simply twaddle. You’ve been over-working.
Take a holiday. Go to Dieppe.”

“I’d rather go to Babylon,” said the learned gentleman.

“I wish you’d go to Atlantis some time, while we’re about it, so as to
give me some tips for my _Nineteenth Century_ article when you come
home.”

“I wish I could,” said the voice of the learned gentleman.


“Goodbye. Take care of yourself.”

The door was banged, and the visitor came smiling down the stairs—a
stout, prosperous, big man. The children had to get up to let him pass.

“Hullo, Kiddies,” he said, glancing at the bandages on the head of
Cyril and the hand of Robert, “been in the wars?”

“It’s all right,” said Cyril. “I say, what was that Atlantic place you
wanted him to go to? We couldn’t help hearing you talk.”

“You talk so _very_ loud, you see,” said Jane soothingly.

“Atlantis,” said the visitor, “the lost Atlantis, garden of the
Hesperides. Great continent—disappeared in the sea. You can read about
it in Plato.”

“Thank you,” said Cyril doubtfully.

“Were there any Amulets there?” asked Anthea, made anxious by a sudden
thought.

“Hundreds, I should think. So _he’s_ been talking to you?”

“Yes, often. He’s very kind to us. We like him awfully.”

“Well, what he wants is a holiday; you persuade him to take one. What
he wants is a change of scene. You see, his head is crusted so thickly
inside with knowledge about Egypt and Assyria and things that you can’t
hammer anything into it unless you keep hard at it all day long for
days and days. And I haven’t time. But you live in the house. You can
hammer almost incessantly. Just try your hands, will you? Right. So
long!”

He went down the stairs three at a time, and Jane remarked that he was
a nice man, and she thought he had little girls of his own.

“I should like to have them to play with,” she added pensively.

The three elder ones exchanged glances. Cyril nodded.

“All right. _Let’s_ go to Atlantis,” he said.

“Let’s go to Atlantis and take the learned gentleman with us,” said
Anthea; “he’ll think it’s a dream, afterwards, but it’ll certainly be a
change of scene.”

“Why not take him to nice Egypt?” asked Jane.

“Too hot,” said Cyril shortly.

“Or Babylon, where he wants to go?”

“I’ve had enough of Babylon,” said Robert, “at least for the present.
And so have the others. I don’t know why,” he added, forestalling the
question on Jane’s lips, “but somehow we have. Squirrel, let’s take off
these beastly bandages and get into flannels. We can’t go in our
unders.”

“He _wished_ to go to Atlantis, so he’s got to go some time; and he
might as well go with us,” said Anthea.

This was how it was that the learned gentleman, permitting himself a
few moments of relaxation in his chair, after the fatigue of listening
to opinions (about Atlantis and many other things) with which he did
not at all agree, opened his eyes to find his four young friends
standing in front of him in a row.

“Will you come,” said Anthea, “to Atlantis with us?”

“To know that you are dreaming shows that the dream is nearly at an
end,” he told himself; “or perhaps it’s only a game, like ‘How many
miles to Babylon?’”

So he said aloud: “Thank you very much, but I have only a quarter of an
hour to spare.”

“It doesn’t take any time,” said Cyril; “time is only a mode of
thought, you know, and you’ve got to go some time, so why not with us?”

“Very well,” said the learned gentleman, now quite certain that he was
dreaming.

Anthea held out her soft, pink hand. He took it. She pulled him gently
to his feet. Jane held up the Amulet.

“To just outside Atlantis,” said Cyril, and Jane said the Name of
Power.

“You owl!” said Robert, “it’s an island. Outside an island’s all
water.”

“I won’t go. I _won’t_,” said the Psammead, kicking and struggling in
its bag.

But already the Amulet had grown to a great arch. Cyril pushed the
learned gentleman, as undoubtedly the first-born, through the arch—not
into water, but on to a wooden floor, out of doors. The others
followed. The Amulet grew smaller again, and there they all were,
standing on the deck of a ship whose sailors were busy making her fast
with chains to rings on a white quay-side. The rings and the chains
were of a metal that shone red-yellow like gold.

Everyone on the ship seemed too busy at first to notice the group of
newcomers from Fitzroy Street. Those who seemed to be officers were
shouting orders to the men.

They stood and looked across the wide quay to the town that rose beyond
it. What they saw was the most beautiful sight any of them had ever
seen—or ever dreamed of.

The blue sea sparkled in soft sunlight; little white-capped waves broke
softly against the marble breakwaters that guarded the shipping of a
great city from the wilderness of winter winds and seas. The quay was
of marble, white and sparkling with a veining bright as gold. The city
was of marble, red and white. The greater buildings that seemed to be
temples and palaces were roofed with what looked like gold and silver,
but most of the roofs were of copper that glowed golden-red on the
houses on the hills among which the city stood, and shaded into
marvellous tints of green and blue and purple where they had been
touched by the salt sea spray and the fumes of the dyeing and smelting
works of the lower town.

Broad and magnificent flights of marble stairs led up from the quay to
a sort of terrace that seemed to run along for miles, and beyond rose
the town built on a hill.

The learned gentleman drew a long breath. “Wonderful!” he said,
“wonderful!”

“I say, Mr—what’s your name,” said Robert.

“He means,” said Anthea, with gentle politeness, “that we never can
remember your name. I know it’s Mr De Something.”

“When I was your age I was called Jimmy,” he said timidly. “Would you
mind? I should feel more at home in a dream like this if I—Anything
that made me seem more like one of you.”

“Thank you—Jimmy,” said Anthea with an effort. It seemed such a cheek
to be saying Jimmy to a grown-up man. “Jimmy, _dear_,” she added, with
no effort at all. Jimmy smiled and looked pleased.

But now the ship was made fast, and the Captain had time to notice
other things. He came towards them, and he was dressed in the best of
all possible dresses for the seafaring life.

“What are you doing here?” he asked rather fiercely. “Do you come to
bless or to curse?”

“To bless, of course,” said Cyril. “I’m sorry if it annoys you, but
we’re here by magic. We come from the land of the sun-rising,” he went
on explanatorily.

“I see,” said the Captain; no one had expected that he would. “I didn’t
notice at first, but of course I hope you’re a good omen. It’s needed.
And this,” he pointed to the learned gentleman, “your slave, I
presume?”

“Not at all,” said Anthea; “he’s a very great man. A sage, don’t they
call it? And we want to see all your beautiful city, and your temples
and things, and then we shall go back, and he will tell his friend, and
his friend will write a book about it.”

“What,” asked the Captain, fingering a rope, “is a book?”

“A record—something written, or,” she added hastily, remembering the
Babylonian writing, “or engraved.”

Some sudden impulse of confidence made Jane pluck the Amulet from the
neck of her frock.

“Like this,” she said.

The Captain looked at it curiously, but, the other three were relieved
to notice, without any of that overwhelming interest which the mere
name of it had roused in Egypt and Babylon.

“The stone is of our country,” he said; “and that which is engraved on
it, it is like our writing, but I cannot read it. What is the name of
your sage?”

“Ji-jimmy,” said Anthea hesitatingly.

The Captain repeated, “Ji-jimmy. Will you land?” he added. “And shall I
lead you to the Kings?”

“Look here,” said Robert, “does your King hate strangers?”

“Our Kings are ten,” said the Captain, “and the Royal line, unbroken
from Poseidon, the father of us all, has the noble tradition to do
honour to strangers if they come in peace.”

“Then lead on, please,” said Robert, “though I _should_ like to see all
over your beautiful ship, and sail about in her.”

“That shall be later,” said the Captain; “just now we’re afraid of a
storm—do you notice that odd rumbling?”

“That’s nothing, master,” said an old sailor who stood near; “it’s the
pilchards coming in, that’s all.”

“Too loud,” said the Captain.

There was a rather anxious pause; then the Captain stepped on to the
quay, and the others followed him.

“Do talk to him—Jimmy,” said Anthea as they went; “you can find out all
sorts of things for your friend’s book.”

“Please excuse me,” he said earnestly. “If I talk I shall wake up; and
besides, I can’t understand what he says.”

No one else could think of anything to say, so that it was in complete
silence that they followed the Captain up the marble steps and through
the streets of the town. There were streets and shops and houses and
markets.

“It’s just like Babylon,” whispered Jane, “only everything’s perfectly
different.”

“It’s a great comfort the ten Kings have been properly brought up—to be
kind to strangers,” Anthea whispered to Cyril.

“Yes,” he said, “no deepest dungeons here.”

There were no horses or chariots in the street, but there were
handcarts and low trolleys running on thick log-wheels, and porters
carrying packets on their heads, and a good many of the people were
riding on what looked like elephants, only the great beasts were hairy,
and they had not that mild expression we are accustomed to meet on the
faces of the elephants at the Zoo.

“Mammoths!” murmured the learned gentleman, and stumbled over a loose
stone.

The people in the streets kept crowding round them as they went along,
but the Captain always dispersed the crowd before it grew uncomfortably
thick by saying—

“Children of the Sun God and their High Priest—come to bless the City.”

And then the people would draw back with a low murmur that sounded like
a suppressed cheer.

Many of the buildings were covered with gold, but the gold on the
bigger buildings was of a different colour, and they had sorts of
steeples of burnished silver rising above them.

“Are all these houses real gold?” asked Jane.

“The temples are covered with gold, of course,” answered the Captain,
“but the houses are only oricalchum. It’s not quite so expensive.”

The learned gentleman, now very pale, stumbled along in a dazed way,
repeating:

“Oricalchum—oricalchum.”

“Don’t be frightened,” said Anthea; “we can get home in a minute, just
by holding up the charm. Would you rather go back now? We could easily
come some other day without you.”

“Oh, no, no,” he pleaded fervently; “let the dream go on. Please,
please do.”

“The High Ji-jimmy is perhaps weary with his magic journey,” said the
Captain, noticing the blundering walk of the learned gentleman; “and we
are yet very far from the Great Temple, where today the Kings make
sacrifice.”

He stopped at the gate of a great enclosure. It seemed to be a sort of
park, for trees showed high above its brazen wall.

The party waited, and almost at once the Captain came back with one of
the hairy elephants and begged them to mount.

This they did.

It was a glorious ride. The elephant at the Zoo—to ride on him is also
glorious, but he goes such a very little way, and then he goes back
again, which is always dull. But this great hairy beast went on and on
and on along streets and through squares and gardens. It was a glorious
city; almost everything was built of marble, red, or white, or black.
Every now and then the party crossed a bridge.

It was not till they had climbed to the hill which is the centre of the
town that they saw that the whole city was divided into twenty circles,
alternately land and water, and over each of the water circles were the
bridges by which they had come.

And now they were in a great square. A vast building filled up one side
of it; it was overlaid with gold, and had a dome of silver. The rest of
the buildings round the square were of oricalchum. And it looked more
splendid than you can possibly imagine, standing up bold and shining in
the sunlight.

“You would like a bath,” said the Captain, as the hairy elephant went
clumsily down on his knees. “It’s customary, you know, before entering
the Presence. We have baths for men, women, horses, and cattle. The
High Class Baths are here. Our Father Poseidon gave us a spring of hot
water and one of cold.”

The children had never before bathed in baths of gold.

“It feels very splendid,” said Cyril, splashing.

“At least, of course, it’s not gold; it’s or—what’s its name,” said
Robert. “Hand over that towel.”

The bathing hall had several great pools sunk below the level of the
floor; one went down to them by steps.

“Jimmy,” said Anthea timidly, when, very clean and boiled-looking, they
all met in the flowery courtyard of the Public, “don’t you think all
this seems much more like _now_ than Babylon or Egypt—? Oh, I forgot,
you’ve never been there.”

“I know a little of those nations, however,” said he, “and I quite
agree with you. A most discerning remark—my dear,” he added awkwardly;
“this city certainly seems to indicate a far higher level of
civilization than the Egyptian or Babylonish, and—”

“Follow me,” said the Captain. “Now, boys, get out of the way.” He
pushed through a little crowd of boys who were playing with dried
chestnuts fastened to a string.

“Ginger!” remarked Robert, “they’re playing conkers, just like the kids
in Kentish Town Road!”

They could see now that three walls surrounded the island on which they
were. The outermost wall was of brass, the Captain told them; the next,
which looked like silver, was covered with tin; and the innermost one
was of oricalchum.

And right in the middle was a wall of gold, with golden towers and
gates.

“Behold the Temples of Poseidon,” said the Captain. “It is not lawful
for me to enter. I will await your return here.”

He told them what they ought to say, and the five people from Fitzroy
Street took hands and went forward. The golden gates slowly opened.

“We are the children of the Sun,” said Cyril, as he had been told, “and
our High Priest, at least that’s what the Captain calls him. We have a
different name for him at home.”

“What is his name?” asked a white-robed man who stood in the doorway
with his arms extended.

“Ji-jimmy,” replied Cyril, and he hesitated as Anthea had done. It
really did seem to be taking a great liberty with so learned a
gentleman. “And we have come to speak with your Kings in the Temple of
Poseidon—does that word sound right?” he whispered anxiously.

“Quite,” said the learned gentleman. “It’s very odd I can understand
what you say to them, but not what they say to you.”

“The Queen of Babylon found that too,” said Cyril; “it’s part of the
magic.”

“Oh, what a dream!” said the learned gentleman.

The white-robed priest had been joined by others, and all were bowing
low.

“Enter,” he said, “enter, Children of the Sun, with your High
Ji-jimmy.”

In an inner courtyard stood the Temple—all of silver, with gold
pinnacles and doors, and twenty enormous statues in bright gold of men
and women. Also an immense pillar of the other precious yellow metal.

They went through the doors, and the priest led them up a stair into a
gallery from which they could look down on to the glorious place.

“The ten Kings are even now choosing the bull. It is not lawful for me
to behold,” said the priest, and fell face downward on the floor
outside the gallery. The children looked down.

The roof was of ivory adorned with the three precious metals, and the
walls were lined with the favourite oricalchum.

At the far end of the Temple was a statue group, the like of which no
one living has ever seen.

It was of gold, and the head of the chief figure reached to the roof.
That figure was Poseidon, the Father of the City. He stood in a great
chariot drawn by six enormous horses, and round about it were a hundred
mermaids riding on dolphins.

Ten men, splendidly dressed and armed only with sticks and ropes, were
trying to capture one of some fifteen bulls who ran this way and that
about the floor of the Temple. The children held their breath, for the
bulls looked dangerous, and the great horned heads were swinging more
and more wildly.

Anthea did not like looking at the bulls. She looked about the gallery,
and noticed that another staircase led up from it to a still higher
storey; also that a door led out into the open air, where there seemed
to be a balcony.

So that when a shout went up and Robert whispered, “Got him,” and she
looked down and saw the herd of bulls being driven out of the Temple by
whips, and the ten Kings following, one of them spurring with his stick
a black bull that writhed and fought in the grip of a lasso, she
answered the boy’s agitated, “Now we shan’t see anything more,” with—

“Yes we can, there’s an outside balcony.”

So they crowded out.

But very soon the girls crept back.

“I don’t like sacrifices,” Jane said. So she and Anthea went and talked
to the priest, who was no longer lying on his face, but sitting on the
top step mopping his forehead with his robe, for it was a hot day.

“It’s a special sacrifice,” he said; “usually it’s only done on the
justice days every five years and six years alternately. And then they
drink the cup of wine with some of the bull’s blood in it, and swear to
judge truly. And they wear the sacred blue robe, and put out all the
Temple fires. But this today is because the City’s so upset by the odd
noises from the sea, and the god inside the big mountain speaking with
his thunder-voice. But all that’s happened so often before. If anything
could make ME uneasy it wouldn’t be _that_.”

“What would it be?” asked Jane kindly.

“It would be the Lemmings.”

“Who are they—enemies?”

“They’re a sort of rat; and every year they come swimming over from the
country that no man knows, and stay here awhile, and then swim away.
This year they haven’t come. You know rats won’t stay on a ship that’s
going to be wrecked. If anything horrible were going to happen to us,
it’s my belief those Lemmings would know; and that may be why they’ve
fought shy of us.”

“What do you call this country?” asked the Psammead, suddenly putting
its head out of its bag.

“Atlantis,” said the priest.

“Then I advise you to get on to the highest ground you can find. I
remember hearing something about a flood here. Look here, you”—it
turned to Anthea; “let’s get home. The prospect’s too wet for my
whiskers.”

The girls obediently went to find their brothers, who were leaning on
the balcony railings.

“Where’s the learned gentleman?” asked Anthea.

“There he is—below,” said the priest, who had come with them. “Your
High Ji-jimmy is with the Kings.”

The ten Kings were no longer alone. The learned gentleman—no one had
noticed how he got there—stood with them on the steps of an altar, on
which lay the dead body of the black bull. All the rest of the
courtyard was thick with people, seemingly of all classes, and all were
shouting, “The sea—the sea!”

“Be calm,” said the most kingly of the Kings, he who had lassoed the
bull. “Our town is strong against the thunders of the sea and of the
sky!”

“I want to go home,” whined the Psammead.

“We can’t go without _him_,” said Anthea firmly.

“Jimmy,” she called, “Jimmy!” and waved to him. He heard her, and began
to come towards her through the crowd.

They could see from the balcony the sea-captain edging his way out from
among the people. And his face was dead white, like paper.

“To the hills!” he cried in a loud and terrible voice. And above his
voice came another voice, louder, more terrible—the voice of the sea.

The girls looked seaward.

Across the smooth distance of the sea something huge and black rolled
towards the town. It was a wave, but a wave a hundred feet in height, a
wave that looked like a mountain—a wave rising higher and higher till
suddenly it seemed to break in two—one half of it rushed out to sea
again; the other—

“Oh!” cried Anthea, “the town—the poor people!”

“It’s all thousands of years ago, really,” said Robert but his voice
trembled. They hid their eyes for a moment. They could not bear to look
down, for the wave had broken on the face of the town, sweeping over
the quays and docks, overwhelming the great storehouses and factories,
tearing gigantic stones from forts and bridges, and using them as
battering rams against the temples. Great ships were swept over the
roofs of the houses and dashed down halfway up the hill among ruined
gardens and broken buildings. The water ground brown fishing-boats to
powder on the golden roofs of Palaces.

Then the wave swept back towards the sea.

“I want to go home,” cried the Psammead fiercely.

“Oh, yes, yes!” said Jane, and the boys were ready—but the learned
gentleman had not come.

Then suddenly they heard him dash up to the inner gallery, crying—

“I _must_ see the end of the dream.” He rushed up the higher flight.
The others followed him. They found themselves in a sort of
turret—roofed, but open to the air at the sides.

The learned gentleman was leaning on the parapet, and as they rejoined
him the vast wave rushed back on the town. This time it rose
higher—destroyed more.

“Come home,” cried the Psammead; “_that’s_ the _last_, I know it is!
That’s the last—over there.” It pointed with a claw that trembled.

“Oh, come!” cried Jane, holding up the Amulet.

“I _will see_ the end of the dream,” cried the learned gentleman.

“You’ll never see anything else if you do,” said Cyril.

“Oh, _Jimmy!_” appealed Anthea. “I’ll _never_ bring you out again!”

“You’ll never have the chance if you don’t go soon,” said the Psammead.

“I _will_ see the end of the dream,” said the learned gentleman
obstinately.

The hills around were black with people fleeing from the villages to
the mountains. And even as they fled thin smoke broke from the great
white peak, and then a faint flash of flame. Then the volcano began to
throw up its mysterious fiery inside parts. The earth trembled; ashes
and sulphur showered down; a rain of fine pumice-stone fell like snow
on all the dry land. The elephants from the forest rushed up towards
the peaks; great lizards thirty yards long broke from the mountain
pools and rushed down towards the sea. The snows melted and rushed
down, first in avalanches, then in roaring torrents. Great rocks cast
up by the volcano fell splashing in the sea miles away.

“Oh, this is horrible!” cried Anthea. “Come home, come home!”

“The end of the dream,” gasped the learned gentleman.

“Hold up the Amulet,” cried the Psammead suddenly. The place where they
stood was now crowded with men and women, and the children were
strained tight against the parapet. The turret rocked and swayed; the
wave had reached the golden wall.

Jane held up the Amulet.

“Now,” cried the Psammead, “say the word!”

And as Jane said it the Psammead leaped from its bag and bit the hand
of the learned gentleman.

At the same moment the boys pushed him through the arch and all
followed him.

He turned to look back, and through the arch he saw nothing but a waste
of waters, with above it the peak of the terrible mountain with fire
raging from it.

He staggered back to his chair.

“What a ghastly dream!” he gasped. “Oh, you’re here, my—er—dears. Can I
do anything for you?”

“You’ve hurt your hand,” said Anthea gently; “let me bind it up.”

The hand was indeed bleeding rather badly.

The Psammead had crept back to its bag. All the children were very
white.

“Never again,” said the Psammead later on, “will I go into the Past
with a grown-up person! I will say for you four, you do do as you’re
told.”

“We didn’t even find the Amulet,” said Anthea later still.

“Of course you didn’t; it wasn’t there. Only the stone it was made of
was there. It fell on to a ship miles away that managed to escape and
got to Egypt. _I_ could have told you that.”

“I wish you had,” said Anthea, and her voice was still rather shaky.
“Why didn’t you?”

“You never asked me,” said the Psammead very sulkily. “I’m not the sort
of chap to go shoving my oar in where it’s not wanted.”

“Mr Ji-jimmy’s friend will have something worth having to put in his
article now,” said Cyril very much later indeed.

“Not he,” said Robert sleepily. “The learned Ji-jimmy will think it’s a
dream, and it’s ten to one he never tells the other chap a word about
it at all.”

Robert was quite right on both points. The learned gentleman did. And
he never did.




CHAPTER X.
THE LITTLE BLACK GIRL AND JULIUS CAESAR


A great city swept away by the sea, a beautiful country devastated by
an active volcano—these are not the sort of things you see every day of
the week. And when you do see them, no matter how many other wonders
you may have seen in your time, such sights are rather apt to take your
breath away. Atlantis had certainly this effect on the breaths of
Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane.

They remained in a breathless state for some days. The learned
gentleman seemed as breathless as anyone; he spent a good deal of what
little breath he had in telling Anthea about a wonderful dream he had.
“You would hardly believe,” he said, “that anyone _could_ have such a
detailed vision.”

But Anthea could believe it, she said, quite easily.

He had ceased to talk about thought-transference. He had now seen too
many wonders to believe that.

In consequence of their breathless condition none of the children
suggested any new excursions through the Amulet. Robert voiced the mood
of the others when he said that they were “fed up” with Amulet for a
bit. They undoubtedly were.

As for the Psammead, it went to sand and stayed there, worn out by the
terror of the flood and the violent exercise it had had to take in
obedience to the inconsiderate wishes of the learned gentleman and the
Babylonian queen.

The children let it sleep. The danger of taking it about among strange
people who might at any moment utter undesirable wishes was becoming
more and more plain.

And there are pleasant things to be done in London without any aid from
Amulets or Psammeads. You can, for instance visit the Tower of London,
the Houses of Parliament, the National Gallery, the Zoological Gardens,
the various Parks, the Museums at South Kensington, Madame Tussaud’s
Exhibition of Waxworks, or the Botanical Gardens at Kew. You can go to
Kew by river steamer—and this is the way that the children would have
gone if they had gone at all. Only they never did, because it was when
they were discussing the arrangements for the journey, and what they
should take with them to eat and how much of it, and what the whole
thing would cost, that the adventure of the Little Black Girl began to
happen.

The children were sitting on a seat in St James’s Park. They had been
watching the pelican repulsing with careful dignity the advances of the
seagulls who are always so anxious to play games with it. The pelican
thinks, very properly, that it hasn’t the figure for games, so it
spends most of its time pretending that that is not the reason why it
won’t play.

The breathlessness caused by Atlantis was wearing off a little. Cyril,
who always wanted to understand all about everything, was turning
things over in his mind.

“I’m not; I’m only thinking,” he answered when Robert asked him what he
was so grumpy about. “I’ll tell you when I’ve thought it all out.”

“If it’s about the Amulet I don’t want to hear it,” said Jane.

“Nobody asked you to,” retorted Cyril mildly, “and I haven’t finished
my inside thinking about it yet. Let’s go to Kew in the meantime.”

“I’d rather go in a steamer,” said Robert; and the girls laughed.

“That’s right,” said Cyril, “_be_ funny. I would.”

“Well, he was, rather,” said Anthea.

“I wouldn’t think, Squirrel, if it hurts you so,” said Robert kindly.

“Oh, shut up,” said Cyril, “or else talk about Kew.”

“I want to see the palms there,” said Anthea hastily, “to see if
they’re anything like the ones on the island where we united the Cook
and the Burglar by the Reverend Half-Curate.”

All disagreeableness was swept away in a pleasant tide of
recollections, and “Do you remember...?” they said. “Have you
forgotten...?”

“My hat!” remarked Cyril pensively, as the flood of reminiscence ebbed
a little; “we have had some times.”

“We have that,” said Robert.

“Don’t let’s have any more,” said Jane anxiously.

“That’s what I was thinking about,” Cyril replied; and just then they
heard the Little Black Girl sniff. She was quite close to them.

She was not really a little black girl. She was shabby and not very
clean, and she had been crying so much that you could hardly see,
through the narrow chink between her swollen lids, how very blue her
eyes were. It was her dress that was black, and it was too big and too
long for her, and she wore a speckled black-ribboned sailor hat that
would have fitted a much bigger head than her little flaxen one. And
she stood looking at the children and sniffing.

“Oh, dear!” said Anthea, jumping up. “Whatever is the matter?”

She put her hand on the little girl’s arm. It was rudely shaken off.

“You leave me be,” said the little girl. “I ain’t doing nothing to
you.”

“But what is it?” Anthea asked. “Has someone been hurting you?”

“What’s that to you?” said the little girl fiercely. “_You’re_ all
right.”

“Come away,” said Robert, pulling at Anthea’s sleeve. “She’s a nasty,
rude little kid.”

“Oh, no,” said Anthea. “She’s only dreadfully unhappy. What is it?” she
asked again.

“Oh, _you’re_ all right,” the child repeated; “_you_ ain’t agoin’ to
the Union.”

“Can’t we take you home?” said Anthea; and Jane added, “Where does your
mother live?”

“She don’t live nowheres—she’s dead—so now!” said the little girl
fiercely, in tones of miserable triumph. Then she opened her swollen
eyes widely, stamped her foot in fury, and ran away. She ran no further
than to the next bench, flung herself down there and began to cry
without even trying not to.

Anthea, quite at once, went to the little girl and put her arms as
tight as she could round the hunched-up black figure.

“Oh, don’t cry so, dear, don’t, don’t!” she whispered under the brim of
the large sailor hat, now very crooked indeed. “Tell Anthea all about
it; Anthea’lll help you. There, there, dear, don’t cry.”

The others stood at a distance. One or two passers-by stared curiously.

The child was now only crying part of the time; the rest of the time
she seemed to be talking to Anthea.

Presently Anthea beckoned Cyril.

“It’s horrible!” she said in a furious whisper, “her father was a
carpenter and he was a steady man, and never touched a drop except on a
Saturday, and he came up to London for work, and there wasn’t any, and
then he died; and her name is Imogen, and she’s nine come next
November. And now her mother’s dead, and she’s to stay tonight with Mrs
Shrobsall—that’s a landlady that’s been kind—and tomorrow the Relieving
Officer is coming for her, and she’s going into the Union; that means
the Workhouse. It’s too terrible. What can we do?”

“Let’s ask the learned gentleman,” said Jane brightly.

And as no one else could think of anything better the whole party
walked back to Fitzroy Street as fast as it could, the little girl
holding tight to Anthea’s hand and now not crying any more, only
sniffing gently.

The learned gentleman looked up from his writing with the smile that
had grown much easier to him than it used to be. They were quite at
home in his room now; it really seemed to welcome them. Even the
mummy-case appeared to smile as if in its distant superior ancient
Egyptian way it were rather pleased to see them than not.

Anthea sat on the stairs with Imogen, who was nine come next November,
while the others went in and explained the difficulty.

The learned gentleman listened with grave attention.

“It really does seem rather rough luck,” Cyril concluded, “because I’ve
often heard about rich people who wanted children most awfully—though I
know _I_ never should—but they do. There must be somebody who’d be glad
to have her.”

“Gipsies are awfully fond of children,” Robert hopefully said. “They’re
always stealing them. Perhaps they’d have her.”

“She’s quite a nice little girl really,” Jane added; “she was only rude
at first because we looked jolly and happy, and she wasn’t. You
understand that, don’t you?”

“Yes,” said he, absently fingering a little blue image from Egypt. “I
understand that very well. As you say, there must be some home where
she would be welcome.” He scowled thoughtfully at the little blue
image.

Anthea outside thought the explanation was taking a very long time. She
was so busy trying to cheer and comfort the little black girl that she
never noticed the Psammead who, roused from sleep by her voice, had
shaken itself free of sand, and was coming crookedly up the stairs. It
was close to her before she saw it. She picked it up and settled it in
her lap.

“What is it?” asked the black child. “Is it a cat or a organ-monkey, or
what?”

And then Anthea heard the learned gentleman say—

“Yes, I wish we could find a home where they would be glad to have
her,” and instantly she felt the Psammead begin to blow itself out as
it sat on her lap.

She jumped up lifting the Psammead in her skirt, and holding Imogen by
the hand, rushed into the learned gentleman’s room.

“At least let’s keep together,” she cried. “All hold hands—quick!”

The circle was like that formed for the Mulberry Bush or Ring-o’-Roses.
And Anthea was only able to take part in it by holding in her teeth the
hem of her frock which, thus supported, formed a bag to hold the
Psammead.

“Is it a game?” asked the learned gentleman feebly. No one answered.

There was a moment of suspense; then came that curious upside-down,
inside-out sensation which one almost always feels when transported
from one place to another by magic. Also there was that dizzy dimness
of sight which comes on these occasions.

The mist cleared, the upside-down, inside-out sensation subsided, and
there stood the six in a ring, as before, only their twelve feet,
instead of standing on the carpet of the learned gentleman’s room,
stood on green grass. Above them, instead of the dusky ceiling of the
Fitzroy Street floor, was a pale blue sky. And where the walls had been
and the painted mummy-case, were tall dark green trees, oaks and ashes,
and in between the trees and under them tangled bushes and creeping
ivy. There were beech-trees too, but there was nothing under them but
their own dead red drifted leaves, and here and there a delicate green
fern-frond.

And there they stood in a circle still holding hands, as though they
were playing Ring-o’-Roses or the Mulberry Bush. Just six people hand
in hand in a wood. That sounds simple, but then you must remember that
they did not know _where_ the wood was, and what’s more, they didn’t
know _when_ then wood was. There was a curious sort of feeling that
made the learned gentleman say—

“Another dream, dear me!” and made the children almost certain that
they were in a time a very long while ago. As for little Imogen, she
said, “Oh, my!” and kept her mouth very much open indeed.

“Where are we?” Cyril asked the Psammead.

“In Britain,” said the Psammead.

“But when?” asked Anthea anxiously.

“About the year fifty-five before the year you reckon time from,” said
the Psammead crossly. “Is there anything else you want to know?” it
added, sticking its head out of the bag formed by Anthea’s blue linen
frock, and turning its snail’s eyes to right and left. “I’ve been here
before—it’s very little changed.”

“Yes, but why here?” asked Anthea.

“Your inconsiderate friend,” the Psammead replied, “wished to find some
home where they would be glad to have that unattractive and immature
female human being whom you have picked up—gracious knows how. In
Megatherium days properly brought-up children didn’t talk to shabby
strangers in parks. Your thoughtless friend wanted a place where
someone would be glad to have this undesirable stranger. And now here
you are!”

“I see we are,” said Anthea patiently, looking round on the tall gloom
of the forest. “But why _here?_ Why _now?_”

“You don’t suppose anyone would want a child like that in _your_
times—in _your_ towns?” said the Psammead in irritated tones. “You’ve
got your country into such a mess that there’s no room for half your
children—and no one to want them.”

“That’s not our doing, you know,” said Anthea gently.

“And bringing me here without any waterproof or anything,” said the
Psammead still more crossly, “when everyone knows how damp and foggy
Ancient Britain was.”

“Here, take my coat,” said Robert, taking it off. Anthea spread the
coat on the ground and, putting the Psammead on it, folded it round so
that only the eyes and furry ears showed.

“There,” she said comfortingly. “Now if it does begin to look like
rain, I can cover you up in a minute. Now what are we to do?”

The others who had stopped holding hands crowded round to hear the
answer to this question. Imogen whispered in an awed tone—

“Can’t the organ monkey talk neither! I thought it was only parrots!”

“Do?” replied the Psammead. “I don’t care what you do!” And it drew
head and ears into the tweed covering of Robert’s coat.

The others looked at each other.

“It’s only a dream,” said the learned gentleman hopefully; “something
is sure to happen if we can prevent ourselves from waking up.”

And sure enough, something did.

The brooding silence of the dark forest was broken by the laughter of
children and the sound of voices.

“Let’s go and see,” said Cyril.

“It’s only a dream,” said the learned gentleman to Jane, who hung back;
“if you don’t go with the tide of a dream—if you resist—you wake up,
you know.”

There was a sort of break in the undergrowth that was like a silly
person’s idea of a path. They went along this in Indian file, the
learned gentleman leading.

Quite soon they came to a large clearing in the forest. There were a
number of houses—huts perhaps you would have called them—with a sort of
mud and wood fence.

“It’s like the old Egyptian town,” whispered Anthea.

And it was, rather.

Some children, with no clothes on at all, were playing what looked like
Ring-o’-Roses or Mulberry Bush. That is to say, they were dancing round
in a ring, holding hands. On a grassy bank several women, dressed in
blue and white robes and tunics of beast-skins sat watching the playing
children.

The children from Fitzroy Street stood on the fringe of the forest
looking at the games. One woman with long, fair braided hair sat a
little apart from the others, and there was a look in her eyes as she
followed the play of the children that made Anthea feel sad and sorry.

“None of those little girls is her own little girl,” thought Anthea.

The little black-clad London child pulled at Anthea’s sleeve.

“Look,” she said, “that one there—she’s precious like mother; mother’s
“air was somethink lovely, when she “ad time to comb it out. Mother
wouldn’t never a-beat me if she’d lived ’ere—I don’t suppose there’s
e’er a public nearer than Epping, do you, Miss?”

In her eagerness the child had stepped out of the shelter of the
forest. The sad-eyed woman saw her. She stood up, her thin face lighted
up with a radiance like sunrise, her long, lean arms stretched towards
the London child.

“Imogen!” she cried—at least the word was more like that than any other
word—“Imogen!”

There was a moment of great silence; the naked children paused in their
play, the women on the bank stared anxiously.

“Oh, it _is_ mother—it _is!_” cried Imogen-from-London, and rushed
across the cleared space. She and her mother clung together—so closely,
so strongly that they stood an instant like a statue carved in stone.

Then the women crowded round.

“It _is_ my Imogen!” cried the woman.

“Oh it is! And she wasn’t eaten by wolves. She’s come back to me. Tell
me, my darling, how did you escape? Where have you been? Who has fed
and clothed you?”

“I don’t know nothink,” said Imogen.

“Poor child!” whispered the women who crowded round, “the terror of the
wolves has turned her brain.”

“But you know _me?_” said the fair-haired woman.

And Imogen, clinging with black-clothed arms to the bare neck,
answered—

“Oh, yes, mother, I know _you_ right ’nough.”

“What is it? What do they say?” the learned gentleman asked anxiously.

“You wished to come where someone wanted the child,” said the Psammead.
“The child says this is her mother.”

“And the mother?”

“You can see,” said the Psammead.

“But is she really? Her child, I mean?”

“Who knows?” said the Psammead; “but each one fills the empty place in
the other’s heart. It is enough.”

“Oh,” said the learned gentleman, “this is a good dream. I wish the
child might stay in the dream.”

The Psammead blew itself out and granted the wish. So Imogen’s future
was assured. She had found someone to want her.

“If only all the children that no one wants,” began the learned
gentleman—but the woman interrupted. She came towards them.

“Welcome, all!” she cried. “I am the Queen, and my child tells me that
you have befriended her; and this I well believe, looking on your
faces. Your garb is strange, but faces I can read. The child is
bewitched, I see that well, but in this she speaks truth. Is it not
so?”

The children said it wasn’t worth mentioning.

I wish you could have seen all the honours and kindnesses lavished on
the children and the learned gentleman by those ancient Britons. You
would have thought, to see them, that a child was something to make a
fuss about, not a bit of rubbish to be hustled about the streets and
hidden away in the Workhouse. It wasn’t as grand as the entertainment
at Babylon, but somehow it was more satisfying.

“I think you children have some wonderful influence on me,” said the
learned gentleman. “I never dreamed such dreams before I knew you.”

It was when they were alone that night under the stars where the
Britons had spread a heap Of dried fern for them to sleep on, that
Cyril spoke.

“Well,” he said, “we’ve made it all right for Imogen, and had a jolly
good time. I vote we get home again before the fighting begins.”

“What fighting?” asked Jane sleepily.

“Why, Julius Caesar, you little goat,” replied her kind brother. “Don’t
you see that if this is the year fifty-five, Julius Caesar may happen
at any moment.”

“I thought you liked Caesar,” said Robert.

“So I do—in the history. But that’s different from being killed by his
soldiers.”

“If we saw Caesar we might persuade him not to,” said Anthea.

“_You_ persuade _Caesar_,” Robert laughed.

The learned gentleman, before anyone could stop him, said, “I only wish
we could see Caesar some time.”

And, of course, in just the little time the Psammead took to blow
itself out for wish-giving, the five, or six counting the Psammead,
found themselves in Caesar’s camp, just outside Caesar’s tent. And they
saw Caesar. The Psammead must have taken advantage of the loose wording
of the learned gentleman’s wish, for it was not the same time of day as
that on which the wish had been uttered among the dried ferns. It was
sunset, and the great man sat on a chair outside his tent gazing over
the sea towards Britain—everyone knew without being told that it was
towards Britain. Two golden eagles on the top of posts stood on each
side of the tent, and on the flaps of the tent which was very gorgeous
to look at were the letters S.P.Q.R.

The great man turned unchanged on the newcomers the august glance that
he had turned on the violet waters of the Channel. Though they had
suddenly appeared out of nothing, Caesar never showed by the faintest
movement of an eyelid, by the least tightening of that firm mouth, that
they were not some long expected embassy. He waved a calm hand towards
the sentinels, who sprang weapons in hand towards the newcomers.

“Back!” he said in a voice that thrilled like music. “Since when has
Caesar feared children and students?”

To the children he seemed to speak in the only language they knew; but
the learned gentleman heard—in rather a strange accent, but quite
intelligibly—the lips of Caesar speaking in the Latin tongue, and in
that tongue, a little stiffly, he answered—

“It is a dream, O Caesar.”

“A dream?” repeated Caesar. “What is a dream?”

“This,” said the learned gentleman.

“Not it,” said Cyril, “it’s a sort of magic. We come out of another
time and another place.”

“And we want to ask you not to trouble about conquering Britain,” said
Anthea; “it’s a poor little place, not worth bothering about.”

“Are you from Britain?” the General asked. “Your clothes are uncouth,
but well woven, and your hair is short as the hair of Roman citizens,
not long like the hair of barbarians, yet such I deem you to be.”

“We’re not,” said Jane with angry eagerness; “we’re not barbarians at
all. We come from the country where the sun never sets, and we’ve read
about you in books; and our country’s full of fine things—St Paul’s,
and the Tower of London, and Madame Tussaud’s Exhibition, and—”

Then the others stopped her.

“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Robert in a bitter undertone.

Caesar looked at the children a moment in silence. Then he called a
soldier and spoke with him apart. Then he said aloud—

“You three elder children may go where you will within the camp. Few
children are privileged to see the camp of Caesar. The student and the
smaller girl-child will remain here with me.”

Nobody liked this; but when Caesar said a thing that thing was so, and
there was an end to it. So the three went.

Left alone with Jane and the learned gentleman, the great Roman found
it easy enough to turn them inside out. But it was not easy, even for
him, to make head or tail of the insides of their minds when he had got
at them.

The learned gentleman insisted that the whole thing was a dream, and
refused to talk much, on the ground that if he did he would wake up.

Jane, closely questioned, was full of information about railways,
electric lights, balloons, men-of-war, cannons, and dynamite.

“And do they fight with swords?” asked the General.

“Yes, swords and guns and cannons.”

Caesar wanted to know what guns were.

“You fire them,” said Jane, “and they go bang, and people fall down
dead.”

“But what are guns like?”

Jane found them hard to describe.

“But Robert has a toy one in his pocket,” she said. So the others were
recalled.

The boys explained the pistol to Caesar very fully, and he looked at it
with the greatest interest. It was a two-shilling pistol, the one that
had done such good service in the old Egyptian village.

“I shall cause guns to be made,” said Caesar, “and you will be detained
till I know whether you have spoken the truth. I had just decided that
Britain was not worth the bother of invading. But what you tell me
decides me that it is very much worth while.”

“But it’s all nonsense,” said Anthea. “Britain is just a savage sort of
island—all fogs and trees and big rivers. But the people are kind. We
know a little girl there named Imogen. And it’s no use your making guns
because you can’t fire them without gunpowder, and that won’t be
invented for hundreds of years, and we don’t know how to make it, and
we can’t tell you. Do go straight home, dear Caesar, and let poor
little Britain alone.”

“But this other girl-child says—” said Caesar.

“All Jane’s been telling you is what it’s going to be,” Anthea
interrupted, “hundreds and hundreds of years from now.”

“The little one is a prophetess, eh?” said Caesar, with a whimsical
look. “Rather young for the business, isn’t she?”

“You can call her a prophetess if you like,” said Cyril, “but what
Anthea says is true.”

“Anthea?” said Caesar. “That’s a Greek name.”

“Very likely,” said Cyril, worriedly. “I say, I do wish you’d give up
this idea of conquering Britain. It’s not worth while, really it
isn’t!”

“On the contrary,” said Caesar, “what you’ve told me has decided me to
go, if it’s only to find out what Britain is really like. Guards,
detain these children.”

“Quick,” said Robert, “before the guards begin detaining. We had enough
of that in Babylon.”

Jane held up the Amulet away from the sunset, and said the word. The
learned gentleman was pushed through and the others more quickly than
ever before passed through the arch back into their own times and the
quiet dusty sitting-room of the learned gentleman.

It is a curious fact that when Caesar was encamped on the coast of
Gaul—somewhere near Boulogne it was, I believe—he was sitting before
his tent in the glow of the sunset, looking out over the violet waters
of the English Channel. Suddenly he started, rubbed his eyes, and
called his secretary. The young man came quickly from within the tent.

“Marcus,” said Caesar. “I have dreamed a very wonderful dream. Some of
it I forget, but I remember enough to decide what was not before
determined. Tomorrow the ships that have been brought round from the
Ligeris shall be provisioned. We shall sail for this three-cornered
island. First, we will take but two legions.

This, if what we have heard be true, should suffice. But if my dream be
true, then a hundred legions will not suffice. For the dream I dreamed
was the most wonderful that ever tormented the brain even of Caesar.
And Caesar has dreamed some strange things in his time.”

“And if you hadn’t told Caesar all that about how things are now, he’d
never have invaded Britain,” said Robert to Jane as they sat down to
tea.

“Oh, nonsense,” said Anthea, pouring out; “it was all settled hundreds
of years ago.”

“I don’t know,” said Cyril. “Jam, please. This about time being only a
thingummy of thought is very confusing. If everything happens at the
same time—”

“It _can’t!_” said Anthea stoutly, “the present’s the present and the
past’s the past.”

“Not always,” said Cyril.

“When we were in the Past the present was the future. Now then!” he
added triumphantly.

And Anthea could not deny it.

“I should have liked to see more of the camp,” said Robert.

“Yes, we didn’t get much for our money—but Imogen is happy, that’s one
thing,” said Anthea. “We left her happy in the Past. I’ve often seen
about people being happy in the Past, in poetry books. I see what it
means now.”

“It’s not a bad idea,” said the Psammead sleepily, putting its head out
of its bag and taking it in again suddenly, “being left in the Past.”

Everyone remembered this afterwards, when—




CHAPTER XI.
BEFORE PHARAOH


It was the day after the adventure of Julius Caesar and the Little
Black Girl that Cyril, bursting into the bathroom to wash his hands for
dinner (you have no idea how dirty they were, for he had been playing
shipwrecked mariners all the morning on the leads at the back of the
house, where the water-cistern is), found Anthea leaning her elbows on
the edge of the bath, and crying steadily into it.

“Hullo!” he said, with brotherly concern, “what’s up now? Dinner’ll be
cold before you’ve got enough salt-water for a bath.”

“Go away,” said Anthea fiercely. “I hate you! I hate everybody!”

There was a stricken pause.

“_I_ didn’t know,” said Cyril tamely.

“Nobody ever does know anything,” sobbed Anthea.

“I didn’t know you were waxy. I thought you’d just hurt your fingers
with the tap again like you did last week,” Cyril carefully explained.

“Oh—fingers!” sneered Anthea through her sniffs.

“Here, drop it, Panther,” he said uncomfortably. “You haven’t been
having a row or anything?”

“No,” she said. “Wash your horrid hands, for goodness’ sake, if that’s
what you came for, or go.”

Anthea was so seldom cross that when she was cross the others were
always more surprised than angry.

Cyril edged along the side of the bath and stood beside her. He put his
hand on her arm.

“Dry up, do,” he said, rather tenderly for him. And, finding that
though she did not at once take his advice she did not seem to resent
it, he put his arm awkwardly across her shoulders and rubbed his head
against her ear.

“There!” he said, in the tone of one administering a priceless cure for
all possible sorrows. “Now, what’s up?”

“Promise you won’t laugh?”

“I don’t feel laughish myself,” said Cyril, dismally.

“Well, then,” said Anthea, leaning her ear against his head, “it’s
Mother.”

“What’s the matter with Mother?” asked Cyril, with apparent want of
sympathy. “She was all right in her letter this morning.”

“Yes; but I want her so.”

“You’re not the only one,” said Cyril briefly, and the brevity of his
tone admitted a good deal.

“Oh, yes,” said Anthea, “I know. We all want her all the time. But I
want her now most dreadfully, awfully much. I never wanted anything so
much. That Imogen child—the way the ancient British Queen cuddled her
up! And Imogen wasn’t me, and the Queen was Mother. And then her letter
this morning! And about The Lamb liking the salt bathing! And she
bathed him in this very bath the night before she went away—oh, oh,
oh!”

Cyril thumped her on the back.

“Cheer up,” he said. “You know my inside thinking that I was doing?
Well, that was partly about Mother. We’ll soon get her back. If you’ll
chuck it, like a sensible kid, and wash your face, I’ll tell you about
it. That’s right. You let me get to the tap. Can’t you stop crying?
Shall I put the door-key down your back?”

“That’s for noses,” said Anthea, “and I’m not a kid any more than you
are,” but she laughed a little, and her mouth began to get back into
its proper shape. You know what an odd shape your mouth gets into when
you cry in earnest.

“Look here,” said Cyril, working the soap round and round between his
hands in a thick slime of grey soapsuds. “I’ve been thinking. We’ve
only just _played_ with the Amulet so far. We’ve got to _work_ it
now—work it for all it’s worth. And it isn’t only Mother either.
There’s Father out there all among the fighting. I don’t howl about it,
but I _think_—Oh, bother the soap!” The grey-lined soap had squirted
out under the pressure of his fingers, and had hit Anthea’s chin with
as much force as though it had been shot from a catapult.

“There now,” she said regretfully, “now I shall have to wash my face.”

“You’d have had to do that anyway,” said Cyril with conviction. “Now,
my idea’s this. You know missionaries?”

“Yes,” said Anthea, who did not know a single one.

“Well, they always take the savages beads and brandy, and stays, and
hats, and braces, and really useful things—things the savages haven’t
got, and never heard about. And the savages love them for their kind
generousness, and give them pearls, and shells, and ivory, and
cassowaries. And that’s the way—”

“Wait a sec,” said Anthea, splashing. “I can’t hear what you’re saying.
Shells and—”

“Shells, and things like that. The great thing is to get people to love
you by being generous. And that’s what we’ve got to do. Next time we go
into the Past we’ll regularly fit out the expedition. You remember how
the Babylonian Queen froze on to that pocket-book? Well, we’ll take
things like that. And offer them in exchange for a sight of the
Amulet.”

“A sight of it is not much good.”

“No, silly. But, don’t you see, when we’ve seen it we shall know where
it is, and we can go and take it in the night when everybody is
asleep.”

“It wouldn’t be stealing, would it?” said Anthea thoughtfully, “because
it will be such an awfully long time ago when we do it. Oh, there’s
that bell again.”

As soon as dinner was eaten (it was tinned salmon and lettuce, and a
jam tart), and the cloth cleared away, the idea was explained to the
others, and the Psammead was aroused from sand, and asked what it
thought would be good merchandise with which to buy the affection of
say, the Ancient Egyptians, and whether it thought the Amulet was
likely to be found in the Court of Pharaoh.

But it shook its head, and shot out its snail’s eyes hopelessly.

“I’m not allowed to play in this game,” it said. “Of course I _could_
find out in a minute where the thing was, only I mayn’t. But I may go
so far as to own that your idea of taking things with you isn’t a bad
one. And I shouldn’t show them all at once. Take small things and
conceal them craftily about your persons.”

This advice seemed good. Soon the table was littered over with things
which the children thought likely to interest the Ancient Egyptians.
Anthea brought dolls, puzzle blocks, a wooden tea-service, a green
leather case with _Nécessaire_ written on it in gold letters. Aunt Emma
had once given it to Anthea, and it had then contained scissors,
penknife, bodkin, stiletto, thimble, corkscrew, and glove-buttoner. The
scissors, knife, and thimble, and penknife were, of course, lost, but
the other things were there and as good as new. Cyril contributed lead
soldiers, a cannon, a catapult, a tin-opener, a tie-clip, and a tennis
ball, and a padlock—no key. Robert collected a candle (“I don’t suppose
they ever saw a self-fitting paraffin one,” he said), a penny Japanese
pin-tray, a rubber stamp with his father’s name and address on it, and
a piece of putty.

Jane added a key-ring, the brass handle of a poker, a pot that had held
cold-cream, a smoked pearl button off her winter coat, and a key—no
lock.

“We can’t take all this rubbish,” said Robert, with some scorn. “We
must just each choose one thing.”

The afternoon passed very agreeably in the attempt to choose from the
table the four most suitable objects. But the four children could not
agree what was suitable, and at last Cyril said—

“Look here, let’s each be blindfolded and reach out, and the first
thing you touch you stick to.”

This was done.

Cyril touched the padlock.

Anthea got the _Nécessaire_.

Robert clutched the candle.

Jane picked up the tie-clip.

“It’s not much,” she said. “I don’t believe Ancient Egyptians wore
ties.”

“Never mind,” said Anthea. “I believe it’s luckier not to really
choose. In the stories it’s always the thing the wood-cutter’s son
picks up in the forest, and almost throws away because he thinks it’s
no good, that turns out to be the magic thing in the end; or else
someone’s lost it, and he is rewarded with the hand of the King’s
daughter in marriage.”

“I don’t want any hands in marriage, thank you.” said Cyril firmly.

“Nor yet me,” said Robert. “It’s always the end of the adventures when
it comes to the marriage hands.”

“_Are_ we ready?” said Anthea.

“It _is_ Egypt we’re going to, isn’t it?—nice Egypt?” said Jane. “I
won’t go anywhere I don’t know about—like that dreadful big-wavy
burning-mountain city,” she insisted.

Then the Psammead was coaxed into its bag.

“I say,” said Cyril suddenly, “I’m rather sick of kings. And people
notice you so in palaces. Besides the Amulet’s sure to be in a Temple.
Let’s just go among the common people, and try to work ourselves up by
degrees. We might get taken on as Temple assistants.”

“Like beadles,” said Anthea, “or vergers. They must have splendid
chances of stealing the Temple treasures.”

“Righto!” was the general rejoinder. The charm was held up. It grew big
once again, and once again the warm golden Eastern light glowed softly
beyond it.

As the children stepped through it loud and furious voices rang in
their ears. They went suddenly from the quiet of Fitzroy Street
dining-room into a very angry Eastern crowd, a crowd much too angry to
notice them. They edged through it to the wall of a house and stood
there. The crowd was of men, women, and children. They were of all
sorts of complexions, and pictures of them might have been coloured by
any child with a shilling paint-box. The colours that child would have
used for complexions would have been yellow ochre, red ochre, light
red, sepia, and indian ink. But their faces were painted already—black
eyebrows and lashes, and some red lips. The women wore a sort of
pinafore with shoulder straps, and loose things wound round their heads
and shoulders. The men wore very little clothing—for they were the
working people—and the Egyptian boys and girls wore nothing at all,
unless you count the little ornaments hung on chains round their necks
and waists. The children saw all this before they could hear anything
distinctly. Everyone was shouting so.

But a voice sounded above the other voices, and presently it was
speaking in a silence.

“Comrades and fellow workers,” it said, and it was the voice of a tall,
coppery-coloured man who had climbed into a chariot that had been
stopped by the crowd. Its owner had bolted, muttering something about
calling the Guards, and now the man spoke from it. “Comrades and fellow
workers, how long are we to endure the tyranny of our masters, who live
in idleness and luxury on the fruit of our toil? They only give us a
bare subsistence wage, and they live on the fat of the land. We labour
all our lives to keep them in wanton luxury. Let us make an end of it!”

A roar of applause answered him.

“How are you going to do it?” cried a voice.

“You look out,” cried another, “or you’ll get yourself into trouble.”

“I’ve heard almost every single word of that,” whispered Robert, “in
Hyde Park last Sunday!”

“Let us strike for more bread and onions and beer, and a longer mid-day
rest,” the speaker went on. “You are tired, you are hungry, you are
thirsty. You are poor, your wives and children are pining for food. The
barns of the rich are full to bursting with the corn we want, the corn
our labour has grown. To the granaries!”

“To the granaries!” cried half the crowd; but another voice shouted
clear above the tumult, “To Pharaoh! To the King! Let’s present a
petition to the King! He will listen to the voice of the oppressed!”

For a moment the crowd swayed one way and another—first towards the
granaries and then towards the palace. Then, with a rush like that of
an imprisoned torrent suddenly set free, it surged along the street
towards the palace, and the children were carried with it. Anthea found
it difficult to keep the Psammead from being squeezed very
uncomfortably.

The crowd swept through the streets of dull-looking houses with few
windows, very high up, across the market where people were not buying
but exchanging goods. In a momentary pause Robert saw a basket of
onions exchanged for a hair comb and five fish for a string of beads.
The people in the market seemed better off than those in the crowd;
they had finer clothes, and more of them. They were the kind of people
who, nowadays, would have lived at Brixton or Brockley.

“What’s the trouble now?” a languid, large-eyed lady in a crimped,
half-transparent linen dress, with her black hair very much braided and
puffed out, asked of a date-seller.

“Oh, the working-men—discontented as usual,” the man answered. “Listen
to them. Anyone would think it mattered whether they had a little more
or less to eat. Dregs of society!” said the date-seller.

“Scum!” said the lady.

“And I’ve heard _that_ before, too,” said Robert.

At that moment the voice of the crowd changed, from anger to doubt,
from doubt to fear. There were other voices shouting; they shouted
defiance and menace, and they came nearer very quickly. There was the
rattle of wheels and the pounding of hoofs. A voice shouted, “Guards!”

“The Guards! The Guards!” shouted another voice, and the crowd of
workmen took up the cry. “The Guards! Pharaoh’s Guards!” And swaying a
little once more, the crowd hung for a moment as it were balanced. Then
as the trampling hoofs came nearer the workmen fled dispersed, up
alleys and into the courts of houses, and the Guards in their embossed
leather chariots swept down the street at the gallop, their wheels
clattering over the stones, and their dark-coloured, blue tunics blown
open and back with the wind of their going.

“So _that_ riot’s over,” said the crimped-linen-dressed lady; “that’s a
blessing! And did you notice the Captain of the Guard? What a very
handsome man he was, to be sure!”

The four children had taken advantage of the moment’s pause before the
crowd turned to fly, to edge themselves and drag each other into an
arched doorway.

Now they each drew a long breath and looked at the others.

“We’re well out of _that_,” said Cyril.

“Yes,” said Anthea, “but I do wish the poor men hadn’t been driven back
before they could get to the King. He might have done something for
them.”

“Not if he was the one in the Bible he wouldn’t,” said Jane. “He had a
hard heart.”

“Ah, that was the Moses one,” Anthea explained. “The Joseph one was
quite different. I should like to see Pharaoh’s house. I wonder whether
it’s like the Egyptian Court in the Crystal Palace.”

“I thought we decided to try to get taken on in a Temple,” said Cyril
in injured tones.

“Yes, but we’ve got to know someone first. Couldn’t we make friends
with a Temple doorkeeper—we might give him the padlock or something. I
wonder which are temples and which are palaces,” Robert added, glancing
across the market-place to where an enormous gateway with huge side
buildings towered towards the sky. To right and left of it were other
buildings only a little less magnificent.

“Did you wish to seek out the Temple of Amen Rā?” asked a soft voice
behind them, “or the Temple of Mut, or the Temple of Khonsu?”

They turned to find beside them a young man. He was shaved clean from
head to foot, and on his feet were light papyrus sandals. He was
clothed in a linen tunic of white, embroidered heavily in colours. He
was gay with anklets, bracelets, and armlets of gold, richly inlaid. He
wore a ring on his finger, and he had a short jacket of gold embroidery
something like the Zouave soldiers wear, and on his neck was a gold
collar with many amulets hanging from it. But among the amulets the
children could see none like theirs.

“It doesn’t matter which Temple,” said Cyril frankly.

“Tell me your mission,” said the young man. “I am a divine father of
the Temple of Amen Rā and perhaps I can help you.”

“Well,” said Cyril, “we’ve come from the great Empire on which the sun
never sets.”

“I thought somehow that you’d come from some odd, out-of-the-way spot,”
said the priest with courtesy.

“And we’ve seen a good many palaces. We thought we should like to see a
Temple, for a change,” said Robert.

The Psammead stirred uneasily in its embroidered bag.

“Have you brought gifts to the Temple?” asked the priest cautiously.

“We _have_ got some gifts,” said Cyril with equal caution. “You see
there’s magic mixed up in it. So we can’t tell you everything. But we
don’t want to give our gifts for nothing.”

“Beware how you insult the god,” said the priest sternly. “I also can
do magic. I can make a waxen image of you, and I can say words which,
as the wax image melts before the fire, will make you dwindle away and
at last perish miserably.”

“Pooh!” said Cyril stoutly, “that’s nothing. I can make _fire_ itself!”

“I should jolly well like to see you do it,” said the priest
unbelievingly.

“Well, you shall,” said Cyril, “nothing easier. Just stand close round
me.”

“Do you need no preparation—no fasting, no incantations?” The priest’s
tone was incredulous.

“The incantation’s quite short,” said Cyril, taking the hint; “and as
for fasting, it’s not needed in _my_ sort of magic. Union Jack,
Printing Press, Gunpowder, Rule Britannia! Come, Fire, at the end of
this little stick!”

He had pulled a match from his pocket, and as he ended the incantation
which contained no words that it seemed likely the Egyptian had ever
heard he stooped in the little crowd of his relations and the priest
and struck the match on his boot. He stood up, shielding the flame with
one hand.

“See?” he said, with modest pride. “Here, take it into your hand.”

“No, thank you,” said the priest, swiftly backing. “Can you do that
again?”

“Yes.”

“Then come with me to the great double house of Pharaoh. He loves good
magic, and he will raise you to honour and glory. There’s no need of
secrets between initiates,” he went on confidentially. “The fact is, I
am out of favour at present owing to a little matter of failure of
prophecy. I told him a beautiful princess would be sent to him from
Syria, and, lo! a woman thirty years old arrived. But she _was_ a
beautiful woman not so long ago. Time is only a mode of thought, you
know.”

The children thrilled to the familiar words.

“So you know that too, do you?” said Cyril.

“It is part of the mystery of all magic, is it not?” said the priest.
“Now if I bring you to Pharaoh the little unpleasantness I spoke of
will be forgotten. And I will ask Pharaoh, the Great House, Son of the
Sun, and Lord of the South and North, to decree that you shall lodge in
the Temple. Then you can have a good look round, and teach me your
magic. And I will teach you mine.”

This idea seemed good—at least it was better than any other which at
that moment occurred to anybody, so they followed the priest through
the city.

The streets were very narrow and dirty. The best houses, the priest
explained, were built within walls twenty to twenty-five feet high, and
such windows as showed in the walls were very high up. The tops of
palm-trees showed above the walls. The poor people’s houses were little
square huts with a door and two windows, and smoke coming out of a hole
in the back.

“The poor Egyptians haven’t improved so very much in their building
since the first time we came to Egypt,” whispered Cyril to Anthea.

The huts were roofed with palm branches, and everywhere there were
chickens, and goats, and little naked children kicking about in the
yellow dust. On one roof was a goat, who had climbed up and was eating
the dry palm-leaves with snorts and head-tossings of delight. Over
every house door was some sort of figure or shape.

“Amulets,” the priest explained, “to keep off the evil eye.”

“I don’t think much of your ‘nice Egypt’,” Robert whispered to Jane;
“it’s simply not a patch on Babylon.”

“Ah, you wait till you see the palace,” Jane whispered back.

The palace was indeed much more magnificent than anything they had yet
seen that day, though it would have made but a poor show beside that of
the Babylonian King. They came to it through a great square pillared
doorway of sandstone that stood in a high brick wall. The shut doors
were of massive cedar, with bronze hinges, and were studded with bronze
nails. At the side was a little door and a wicket gate, and through
this the priest led the children. He seemed to know a word that made
the sentries make way for him.

Inside was a garden, planted with hundreds of different kinds of trees
and flowering shrubs, a lake full of fish, with blue lotus flowers at
the margin, and ducks swimming about cheerfully, and looking, as Jane
said, quite modern.

“The guard-chamber, the store-houses, the queen’s house,” said the
priest, pointing them out.

They passed through open courtyards, paved with flat stones, and the
priest whispered to a guard at a great inner gate.

“We are fortunate,” he said to the children, “Pharaoh is even now in
the Court of Honour. Now, don’t forget to be overcome with respect and
admiration. It won’t do any harm if you fall flat on your faces. And
whatever you do, don’t speak until you’re spoken to.”

“There used to be that rule in our country,” said Robert, “when my
father was a little boy.”

At the outer end of the great hall a crowd of people were arguing with
and even shoving the Guards, who seemed to make it a rule not to let
anyone through unless they were bribed to do it. The children heard
several promises of the utmost richness, and wondered whether they
would ever be kept.

All round the hall were pillars of painted wood. The roof was of cedar,
gorgeously inlaid. About half-way up the hall was a wide, shallow step
that went right across the hall; then a little farther on another; and
then a steep flight of narrower steps, leading right up to the throne
on which Pharaoh sat. He sat there very splendid, his red and white
double crown on his head, and his sceptre in his hand. The throne had a
canopy of wood and wooden pillars painted in bright colours. On a low,
broad bench that ran all round the hall sat the friends, relatives, and
courtiers of the King, leaning on richly-covered cushions.

The priest led the children up the steps till they all stood before the
throne; and then, suddenly, he fell on his face with hands
outstretched. The others did the same, Anthea falling very carefully
because of the Psammead.

“Raise them,” said the voice of Pharaoh, “that they may speak to me.”

The officers of the King’s household raised them.

“Who are these strangers?” Pharaoh asked, and added very crossly, “And
what do you mean, Rekh-marā, by daring to come into my presence while
your innocence is not established?”

“Oh, great King,” said the young priest, “you are the very image of Rā,
and the likeness of his son Horus in every respect. You know the
thoughts of the hearts of the gods and of men, and you have divined
that these strangers are the children of the children of the vile and
conquered Kings of the Empire where the sun never sets. They know a
magic not known to the Egyptians. And they come with gifts in their
hands as tribute to Pharaoh, in whose heart is the wisdom of the gods,
and on his lips their truth.”

“That is all very well,” said Pharaoh, “but where are the gifts?”

The children, bowing as well as they could in their embarrassment at
finding themselves the centre of interest in a circle more grand, more
golden and more highly coloured than they could have imagined possible,
pulled out the padlock, the _Nécessaire_, and the tie-clip. “But it’s
not tribute all the same,” Cyril muttered. “England doesn’t pay
tribute!”

Pharaoh examined all the things with great interest when the chief of
the household had taken them up to him. “Deliver them to the Keeper of
the Treasury,” he said to one near him. And to the children he said—

“A small tribute, truly, but strange, and not without worth. And the
magic, O Rekh-marā?”

“These unworthy sons of a conquered nation...” began Rekh-marā.

“Nothing of the kind!” Cyril whispered angrily.

“... of a vile and conquered nation, can make fire to spring from dry
wood—in the sight of all.”

“I should jolly well like to see them do it,” said Pharaoh, just as the
priest had done.

So Cyril, without more ado, did it.

“Do more magic,” said the King, with simple appreciation.

“He cannot do any more magic,” said Anthea suddenly, and all eyes were
turned on her, “because of the voice of the free people who are
shouting for bread and onions and beer and a long mid-day rest. If the
people had what they wanted, he could do more.”

“A rude-spoken girl,” said Pharaoh. “But give the dogs what they want,”
he said, without turning his head. “Let them have their rest and their
extra rations. There are plenty of slaves to work.”

A richly-dressed official hurried out.

“You will be the idol of the people,” Rekh-marā whispered joyously;
“the Temple of Amen will not contain their offerings.”

Cyril struck another match, and all the court was overwhelmed with
delight and wonder. And when Cyril took the candle from his pocket and
lighted it with the match, and then held the burning candle up before
the King the enthusiasm knew no bounds.

“Oh, greatest of all, before whom sun and moon and stars bow down,”
said Rekh-marā insinuatingly, “am I pardoned? Is my innocence made
plain?”

“As plain as it ever will be, I daresay,” said Pharaoh shortly. “Get
along with you. You are pardoned. Go in peace.” The priest went with
lightning swiftness.

“And what,” said the King suddenly, “is it that moves in that sack?

Show me, oh strangers.”

There was nothing for it but to show the Psammead.

“Seize it,” said Pharaoh carelessly. “A very curious monkey. It will be
a nice little novelty for my wild beast collection.”

And instantly, the entreaties of the children availing as little as the
bites of the Psammead, though both bites and entreaties were fervent,
it was carried away from before their eyes.

“Oh, _do_ be careful!” cried Anthea. “At least keep it dry! Keep it in
its sacred house!”

She held up the embroidered bag.

“It’s a magic creature,” cried Robert; “it’s simply priceless!”

“You’ve no right to take it away,” cried Jane incautiously. “It’s a
shame, a barefaced robbery, that’s what it is!”

There was an awful silence. Then Pharaoh spoke.

“Take the sacred house of the beast from them,” he said, “and imprison
all. Tonight after supper it may be our pleasure to see more magic.
Guard them well, and do not torture them—yet!”

“Oh, dear!” sobbed Jane, as they were led away. “I knew exactly what it
would be! Oh, I wish you hadn’t!”

“Shut up, silly,” said Cyril. “You know you _would_ come to Egypt. It
was your own idea entirely. Shut up. It’ll be all right.”

“I thought we should play ball with queens,” sobbed Jane, “and have no
end of larks! And now everything’s going to be perfectly horrid!”

The room they were shut up in _was_ a room, and not a dungeon, as the
elder ones had feared. That, as Anthea said, was one comfort. There
were paintings on the wall that at any other time would have been most
interesting. And a sort of low couch, and chairs.

When they were alone Jane breathed a sigh of relief.

“Now we can get home all right,” she said.

“And leave the Psammead?” said Anthea reproachfully.

“Wait a sec. I’ve got an idea,” said Cyril. He pondered for a few
moments. Then he began hammering on the heavy cedar door. It opened,
and a guard put in his head.

“Stop that row,” he said sternly, “or—”

“Look here,” Cyril interrupted, “it’s very dull for you isn’t it? Just
doing nothing but guard us. Wouldn’t you like to see some magic? We’re
not too proud to do it for you. Wouldn’t you like to see it?”

“I don’t mind if I do,” said the guard.

“Well then, you get us that monkey of ours that was taken away, and
we’ll show you.”

“How do I know you’re not making game of me?” asked the soldier.
“Shouldn’t wonder if you only wanted to get the creature so as to set
it on me. I daresay its teeth and claws are poisonous.”

“Well, look here,” said Robert. “You see we’ve got nothing with us? You
just shut the door, and open it again in five minutes, and we’ll have
got a magic—oh, I don’t know—a magic flower in a pot for you.”

“If you can do that you can do anything,” said the soldier, and he went
out and barred the door.

Then, of course, they held up the Amulet. They found the East by
holding it up, and turning slowly till the Amulet began to grow big,
walked home through it, and came back with a geranium in full scarlet
flower from the staircase window of the Fitzroy Street house.

“Well!” said the soldier when he came in. “I really am—!”

“We can do much more wonderful things than that—oh, ever so much,” said
Anthea persuasively, “if we only have our monkey. And here’s twopence
for yourself.”

The soldier looked at the twopence.

“What’s this?” he said.

Robert explained how much simpler it was to pay money for things than
to exchange them as the people were doing in the market. Later on the
soldier gave the coins to his captain, who, later still, showed them to
Pharaoh, who of course kept them and was much struck with the idea.
That was really how coins first came to be used in Egypt. You will not
believe this, I daresay, but really, if you believe the rest of the
story, I don’t see why you shouldn’t believe this as well.

“I say,” said Anthea, struck by a sudden thought, “I suppose it’ll be
all right about those workmen? The King won’t go back on what he said
about them just because he’s angry with us?”

“Oh, no,” said the soldier, “you see, he’s rather afraid of magic.
He’ll keep to his word right enough.”

“Then _that’s_ all right,” said Robert; and Anthea said softly and
coaxingly—

“Ah, _do_ get us the monkey, and then you’ll see some lovely magic.
Do—there’s a nice, kind soldier.”

“I don’t know where they’ve put your precious monkey, but if I can get
another chap to take on my duty here I’ll see what I can do,” he said
grudgingly, and went out.

“Do you mean,” said Robert, “that we’re going off without even _trying_
for the other half of the Amulet?”

“I really think we’d better,” said Anthea tremulously.

“Of course the other half of the Amulet’s here somewhere or our half
wouldn’t have brought us here. I do wish we could find it. It is a pity
we don’t know any _real_ magic. Then we could find out. I do wonder
where it is—exactly.”

If they had only known it, something very like the other half of the
Amulet was very near them. It hung round the neck of someone, and that
someone was watching them through a chink, high up in the wall,
specially devised for watching people who were imprisoned. But they did
not know.

There was nearly an hour of anxious waiting. They tried to take an
interest in the picture on the wall, a picture of harpers playing very
odd harps and women dancing at a feast. They examined the painted
plaster floor, and the chairs were of white painted wood with coloured
stripes at intervals.

But the time went slowly, and everyone had time to think of how Pharaoh
had said, “Don’t torture them—_yet_.”

“If the worst comes to the worst,” said Cyril, “we must just bunk, and
leave the Psammead. I believe it can take care of itself well enough.
They won’t kill it or hurt it when they find it can speak and give
wishes. They’ll build it a temple, I shouldn’t wonder.”

“I couldn’t bear to go without it,” said Anthea, “and Pharaoh said
‘After supper’, that won’t be just yet. And the soldier _was_ curious.
I’m sure we’re all right for the present.”

All the same, the sounds of the door being unbarred seemed one of the
prettiest sounds possible.

“Suppose he hasn’t got the Psammead?” whispered Jane.

But that doubt was set at rest by the Psammead itself; for almost
before the door was open it sprang through the chink of it into
Anthea’s arms, shivering and hunching up its fur.

“Here’s its fancy overcoat,” said the soldier, holding out the bag,
into which the Psammead immediately crept.

“Now,” said Cyril, “what would you like us to do? Anything you’d like
us to get for you?”

“Any little trick you like,” said the soldier. “If you can get a
strange flower blooming in an earthenware vase you can get anything, I
suppose,” he said. “I just wish I’d got two men’s loads of jewels from
the King’s treasury. That’s what I’ve always wished for.”

At the word “_wish_” the children knew that the Psammead would attend
to _that_ bit of magic. It did, and the floor was littered with a
spreading heap of gold and precious stones.

“Any other little trick?” asked Cyril loftily. “Shall we become
invisible? Vanish?”

“Yes, if you like,” said the soldier; “but not through the door, you
don’t.”

He closed it carefully and set his broad Egyptian back against it.

“No! no!” cried a voice high up among the tops of the tall wooden
pillars that stood against the wall. There was a sound of someone
moving above.

The soldier was as much surprised as anybody.

“That’s magic, if you like,” he said.

And then Jane held up the Amulet, uttering the word of Power. At the
sound of it and at the sight of the Amulet growing into the great arch
the soldier fell flat on his face among the jewels with a cry of awe
and terror.

The children went through the arch with a quickness born of long
practice. But Jane stayed in the middle of the arch and looked back.

The others, standing on the dining-room carpet in Fitzroy Street,
turned and saw her still in the arch. “Someone’s holding her,” cried
Cyril. “We must go back.”

But they pulled at Jane’s hands just to see if she would come, and, of
course, she did come.

Then, as usual, the arch was little again and there they all were.

“Oh, I do wish you hadn’t!” Jane said crossly. “It _was_ so
interesting. The priest had come in and he was kicking the soldier, and
telling him he’d done it now, and they must take the jewels and flee
for their lives.”

“And did they?”

“I don’t know. You interfered,” said Jane ungratefully. “I _should_
have liked to see the last of it.”

As a matter of fact, none of them had seen the last of it—if by “it”
Jane meant the adventure of the Priest and the Soldier.




CHAPTER XII.
THE SORRY-PRESENT AND THE EXPELLED LITTLE BOY


“Look here, said Cyril, sitting on the dining-table and swinging his
legs; “I really have got it.”

“Got what?” was the not unnatural rejoinder of the others.

Cyril was making a boat with a penknife and a piece of wood, and the
girls were making warm frocks for their dolls, for the weather was
growing chilly.

“Why, don’t you see? It’s really not any good our going into the Past
looking for that Amulet. The Past’s as full of different times as—as
the sea is of sand. We’re simply bound to hit upon the wrong time. We
might spend our lives looking for the Amulet and never see a sight of
it. Why, it’s the end of September already. It’s like looking for a
needle in—”

“A bottle of hay—I know,” interrupted Robert; “but if we don’t go on
doing that, what ARE we to do?”

“That’s just it,” said Cyril in mysterious accents. “Oh, _bother!_”

Old Nurse had come in with the tray of knives, forks, and glasses, and
was getting the tablecloth and table-napkins out of the chiffonier
drawer.

“It’s always meal-times just when you come to anything interesting.”

“And a nice interesting handful _you’d_ be, Master Cyril,” said old
Nurse, “if I wasn’t to bring your meals up to time. Don’t you begin
grumbling now, fear you get something to grumble _at_.”

“I wasn’t grumbling,” said Cyril quite untruly; “but it does always
happen like that.”

“You deserve to _have_ something happen,” said old Nurse. “Slave,
slave, slave for you day and night, and never a word of thanks. ...”

“Why, you do everything beautifully,” said Anthea.

“It’s the first time any of you’s troubled to say so, anyhow,” said
Nurse shortly.

“What’s the use of _saying?_” inquired Robert. “We _eat_ our meals fast
enough, and almost always two helps. _That_ ought to show you!”

“Ah!” said old Nurse, going round the table and putting the knives and
forks in their places; “you’re a man all over, Master Robert. There was
my poor Green, all the years he lived with me I never could get more
out of him than ‘It’s all right!’ when I asked him if he’d fancied his
dinner. And yet, when he lay a-dying, his last words to me was, ‘Maria,
you was always a good cook!’” She ended with a trembling voice.

“And so you are,” cried Anthea, and she and Jane instantly hugged her.

When she had gone out of the room Anthea said—

“I know exactly how she feels. Now, look here! Let’s do a penance to
show we’re sorry we didn’t think about telling her before what nice
cooking she does, and what a dear she is.”

“Penances are silly,” said Robert.

“Not if the penance is something to please someone else. I didn’t mean
old peas and hair shirts and sleeping on the stones. I mean we’ll make
her a sorry-present,” explained Anthea. “Look here! I vote Cyril
doesn’t tell us his idea until we’ve done something for old Nurse. It’s
worse for us than him,” she added hastily, “because he knows what it is
and we don’t. Do you all agree?”

The others would have been ashamed not to agree, so they did. It was
not till quite near the end of dinner—mutton fritters and blackberry
and apple pie—that out of the earnest talk of the four came an idea
that pleased everybody and would, they hoped, please Nurse.

Cyril and Robert went out with the taste of apple still in their mouths
and the purple of blackberries on their lips—and, in the case of
Robert, on the wristband as well—and bought a big sheet of cardboard at
the stationers. Then at the plumber’s shop, that has tubes and pipes
and taps and gas-fittings in the window, they bought a pane of glass
the same size as the cardboard. The man cut it with a very interesting
tool that had a bit of diamond at the end, and he gave them, out of his
own free generousness, a large piece of putty and a small piece of
glue.

While they were out the girls had floated four photographs of the four
children off their cards in hot water. These were now stuck in a row
along the top of the cardboard. Cyril put the glue to melt in a jampot,
and put the jampot in a saucepan and saucepan on the fire, while Robert
painted a wreath of poppies round the photographs. He painted rather
well and very quickly, and poppies are easy to do if you’ve once been
shown how. Then Anthea drew some printed letters and Jane coloured
them. The words were:

“With all our loves to shew
We like the thigs to eat.”


And when the painting was dry they all signed their names at the bottom
and put the glass on, and glued brown paper round the edge and over the
back, and put two loops of tape to hang it up by.

Of course everyone saw when too late that there were not enough letters
in “things”, so the missing “n”was put in. It was impossible, of
course, to do the whole thing over again for just one letter.

“There!” said Anthea, placing it carefully, face up, under the sofa.
“It’ll be hours before the glue’s dry. Now, Squirrel, fire ahead!”

“Well, then,” said Cyril in a great hurry, rubbing at his gluey hands
with his pocket handkerchief. “What I mean to say is this.”

There was a long pause.

“Well,” said Robert at last, “_what_ is it that you mean to say?”

“It’s like this,” said Cyril, and again stopped short.

“Like _what?_” asked Jane.

“How can I tell you if you will all keep on interrupting?” said Cyril
sharply.

So no one said any more, and with wrinkled frowns he arranged his
ideas.

“Look here,” he said, “what I really mean is—we can remember now what
we did when we went to look for the Amulet. And if we’d found it we
should remember that too.”

“Rather!” said Robert. “Only, you see we haven’t.”

“But in the future we shall have.”

“Shall we, though?” said Jane.

“Yes—unless we’ve been made fools of by the Psammead. So then, where we
want to go to is where we shall remember about where we did find it.”

“I see,” said Robert, but he didn’t.

“_I_ don’t,” said Anthea, who did, very nearly. “Say it again,
Squirrel, and very slowly.”

“If,” said Cyril, very slowly indeed, “we go into the future—after
we’ve found the Amulet—”

“But we’ve got to find it first,” said Jane.

“Hush!” said Anthea.

“There will be a future,” said Cyril, driven to greater clearness by
the blank faces of the other three, “there will be a time _after_ we’ve
found it. Let’s go into _that_ time—and then we shall remember _how_ we
found it. And then we can go back and do the finding really.”

“I see,” said Robert, and this time he did, and I hope _you_ do.

“Yes,” said Anthea. “Oh, Squirrel, how clever of you!”

“But will the Amulet work both ways?” inquired Robert.

“It ought to,” said Cyril, “if time’s only a thingummy of whatsitsname.
Anyway we might try.”

“Let’s put on our best things, then,” urged Jane. “You know what people
say about progress and the world growing better and brighter. I expect
people will be awfully smart in the future.”

“All right,” said Anthea, “we should have to wash anyway, I’m all thick
with glue.”

When everyone was clean and dressed, the charm was held up.

“We want to go into the future and see the Amulet after we’ve found
it,” said Cyril, and Jane said the word of Power. They walked through
the big arch of the charm straight into the British Museum. They knew
it at once, and there, right in front of them, under a glass case, was
the Amulet—their own half of it, as well as the other half they had
never been able to find—and the two were joined by a pin of red stone
that formed a hinge.

“Oh, glorious!” cried Robert. “Here it is!”

“Yes,” said Cyril, very gloomily, “here it is. But we can’t get it
out.”

“No,” said Robert, remembering how impossible the Queen of Babylon had
found it to get anything out of the glass cases in the Museum—except by
Psammead magic, and then she hadn’t been able to take anything away
with her; “no—but we remember where we got it, and we can—”

“Oh, _do_ we?” interrupted Cyril bitterly, “do _you_ remember where we
got it?”

“No,” said Robert, “I don’t exactly, now I come to think of it.”

Nor did any of the others!

“But _why_ can’t we?” said Jane.

“Oh, _I_ don’t know,” Cyril’s tone was impatient, “some silly old
enchanted rule I suppose. I wish people would teach you magic at school
like they do sums—or instead of. It would be some use having an Amulet
then.”

“I wonder how far we are in the future,” said Anthea; the Museum looks
just the same, only lighter and brighter, somehow.”

“Let’s go back and try the Past again,” said Robert.

“Perhaps the Museum people could tell us how we got it,” said Anthea
with sudden hope. There was no one in the room, but in the next
gallery, where the Assyrian things are and still were, they found a
kind, stout man in a loose, blue gown, and stockinged legs.

“Oh, they’ve got a new uniform, how pretty!” said Jane.

When they asked him their question he showed them a label on the case.
It said, “From the collection of—.” A name followed, and it was the
name of the learned gentleman who, among themselves, and to his face
when he had been with them at the other side of the Amulet, they had
called Jimmy.

“_That’s_ not much good,” said Cyril, “thank you.”

“How is it you’re not at school?” asked the kind man in blue. “Not
expelled for long I hope?”

“We’re not expelled at all,” said Cyril rather warmly.

“Well, I shouldn’t do it again, if I were you,” said the man, and they
could see he did not believe them. There is no company so little
pleasing as that of people who do not believe you.

“Thank you for showing us the label,” said Cyril. And they came away.

As they came through the doors of the Museum they blinked at the sudden
glory of sunlight and blue sky. The houses opposite the Museum were
gone. Instead there was a big garden, with trees and flowers and smooth
green lawns, and not a single notice to tell you not to walk on the
grass and not to destroy the trees and shrubs and not to pick the
flowers. There were comfortable seats all about, and arbours covered
with roses, and long, trellised walks, also rose-covered. Whispering,
splashing fountains fell into full white marble basins, white statues
gleamed among the leaves, and the pigeons that swept about among the
branches or pecked on the smooth, soft gravel were not black and
tumbled like the Museum pigeons are now, but bright and clean and sleek
as birds of new silver. A good many people were sitting on the seats,
and on the grass babies were rolling and kicking and playing—with very
little on indeed. Men, as well as women, seemed to be in charge of the
babies and were playing with them.

“It’s like a lovely picture,” said Anthea, and it was. For the people’s
clothes were of bright, soft colours and all beautifully and very
simply made. No one seemed to have any hats or bonnets, but there were
a great many Japanese-looking sunshades. And among the trees were hung
lamps of coloured glass.

“I expect they light those in the evening,” said Jane. “I _do_ wish we
lived in the future!”

They walked down the path, and as they went the people on the benches
looked at the four children very curiously, but not rudely or unkindly.
The children, in their turn, looked—I hope they did not stare—at the
faces of these people in the beautiful soft clothes. Those faces were
worth looking at. Not that they were all handsome, though even in the
matter of handsomeness they had the advantage of any set of people the
children had ever seen. But it was the expression of their faces that
made them worth looking at. The children could not tell at first what
it was.

“I know,” said Anthea suddenly. “They’re not worried; that’s what it
is.”

And it was. Everybody looked calm, no one seemed to be in a hurry, no
one seemed to be anxious, or fretted, and though some did seem to be
sad, not a single one looked worried.

But though the people looked kind everyone looked so interested in the
children that they began to feel a little shy and turned out of the big
main path into a narrow little one that wound among trees and shrubs
and mossy, dripping springs.

It was here, in a deep, shadowed cleft between tall cypresses, that
they found the expelled little boy. He was lying face downward on the
mossy turf, and the peculiar shaking of his shoulders was a thing they
had seen, more than once, in each other. So Anthea kneeled down by him
and said—

“What’s the matter?”

“I’m expelled from school,” said the boy between his sobs.

This was serious. People are not expelled for light offences.

“Do you mind telling us what you’d done?”

“I—I tore up a sheet of paper and threw it about in the playground,”
said the child, in the tone of one confessing an unutterable baseness.
“You won’t talk to me any more now you know that,” he added without
looking up.

“Was that all?” asked Anthea.

“It’s about enough,” said the child; “and I’m expelled for the whole
day!”

“I don’t quite understand,” said Anthea, gently. The boy lifted his
face, rolled over, and sat up.

“Why, whoever on earth are you?” he said.

“We’re strangers from a far country,” said Anthea. “In our country it’s
not a crime to leave a bit of paper about.”

“It is here,” said the child. “If grown-ups do it they’re fined. When
we do it we’re expelled for the whole day.”

“Well, but,” said Robert, “that just means a day’s holiday.”

“You _must_ come from a long way off,” said the little boy. “A
holiday’s when you all have play and treats and jolliness, all of you
together. On your expelled days no one’ll speak to you. Everyone sees
you’re an Expelleder or you’d be in school.”

“Suppose you were ill?”

“Nobody is—hardly. If they are, of course they wear the badge, and
everyone is kind to you. I know a boy that stole his sister’s illness
badge and wore it when he was expelled for a day. _He_ got expelled for
a week for that. It must be awful not to go to school for a week.”

“Do you _like_ school, then?” asked Robert incredulously.

“Of course I do. It’s the loveliest place there is. I chose railways
for my special subject this year, there are such splendid models and
things, and now I shall be all behind because of that torn-up paper.”

“You choose your own subject?” asked Cyril.

“Yes, of course. Where _did_ you come from? Don’t you know _anything?_”

“No,” said Jane definitely; “so you’d better tell us.”

“Well, on Midsummer Day school breaks up and everything’s decorated
with flowers, and you choose your special subject for next year. Of
course you have to stick to it for a year at least. Then there are all
your other subjects, of course, reading, and painting, and the rules of
Citizenship.”

“Good gracious!” said Anthea.

“Look here,” said the child, jumping up, “it’s nearly four. The
expelledness only lasts till then. Come home with me. Mother will tell
you all about everything.”

“Will your mother like you taking home strange children?” asked Anthea.

“I don’t understand,” said the child, settling his leather belt over
his honey-coloured smock and stepping out with hard little bare feet.
“Come on.”

So they went.

The streets were wide and hard and very clean. There were no horses,
but a sort of motor carriage that made no noise. The Thames flowed
between green banks, and there were trees at the edge, and people sat
under them, fishing, for the stream was clear as crystal. Everywhere
there were green trees and there was no smoke. The houses were set in
what seemed like one green garden.

The little boy brought them to a house, and at the window was a good,
bright mother-face. The little boy rushed in, and through the window
they could see him hugging his mother, then his eager lips moving and
his quick hands pointing.

A lady in soft green clothes came out, spoke kindly to them, and took
them into the oddest house they had ever seen. It was very bare, there
were no ornaments, and yet every single thing was beautiful, from the
dresser with its rows of bright china, to the thick squares of
Eastern-looking carpet on the floors. I can’t describe that house; I
haven’t the time. And I haven’t heart either, when I think how
different it was from our houses. The lady took them all over it. The
oddest thing of all was the big room in the middle. It had padded walls
and a soft, thick carpet, and all the chairs and tables were padded.
There wasn’t a single thing in it that anyone could hurt itself with.

“What ever’s this for?—lunatics?” asked Cyril.

The lady looked very shocked.

“No! It’s for the children, of course,” she said. “Don’t tell me that
in your country there are no children’s rooms.”

“There are nurseries,” said Anthea doubtfully, “but the furniture’s all
cornery and hard, like other rooms.”

“How shocking!” said the lady; “you must be _very_ much behind the
times in your country! Why, the children are more than half of the
people; it’s not much to have one room where they can have a good time
and not hurt themselves.”

“But there’s no fireplace,” said Anthea.

“Hot-air pipes, of course,” said the lady. “Why, how could you have a
fire in a nursery? A child might get burned.”

“In our country,” said Robert suddenly, “more than 3,000 children are
burned to death every year. Father told me,” he added, as if
apologizing for this piece of information, “once when I’d been playing
with fire.”

The lady turned quite pale.

“What a frightful place you must live in!” she said.

“What’s all the furniture padded for?” Anthea asked, hastily turning
the subject.

“Why, you couldn’t have little tots of two or three running about in
rooms where the things were hard and sharp! They might hurt
themselves.”

Robert fingered the scar on his forehead where he had hit it against
the nursery fender when he was little.

“But does everyone have rooms like this, poor people and all?” asked
Anthea.

“There’s a room like this wherever there’s a child, of course,” said
the lady. “How refreshingly ignorant you are!—no, I don’t mean
ignorant, my dear. Of course, you’re awfully well up in ancient
History. But I see you haven’t done your Duties of Citizenship Course
yet.”

“But beggars, and people like that?” persisted Anthea “and tramps and
people who haven’t any homes?”

“People who haven’t any homes?” repeated the lady. “I really _don’t_
understand what you’re talking about.”

“It’s all different in our country,” said Cyril carefully; and I have
read it used to be different in London. Usedn’t people to have no homes
and beg because they were hungry? And wasn’t London very black and
dirty once upon a time? And the Thames all muddy and filthy? And narrow
streets, and—”

“You must have been reading very old-fashioned books,” said the lady.
“Why, all that was in the dark ages! My husband can tell you more about
it than I can. He took Ancient History as one of his special subjects.”

“I haven’t seen any working people,” said Anthea.

“Why, we’re all working people,” said the lady; “at least my husband’s
a carpenter.”

“Good gracious!” said Anthea; “but you’re a lady!”

“Ah,” said the lady, “that quaint old word! Well, my husband _will_
enjoy a talk with you. In the dark ages everyone was allowed to have a
smoky chimney, and those nasty horses all over the streets, and all
sorts of rubbish thrown into the Thames. And, of course, the sufferings
of the people will hardly bear thinking of. It’s very learned of you to
know it all. Did _you_ make Ancient History your special subject?”

“Not exactly,” said Cyril, rather uneasily. “What is the Duties of
Citizenship Course about?”

“Don’t you _really_ know? Aren’t you pretending—just for fun? Really
not? Well, that course teaches you how to be a good citizen, what you
must do and what you mayn’t do, so as to do your full share of the work
of making your town a beautiful and happy place for people to live in.
There’s a quite simple little thing they teach the tiny children. How
does it go...?

“I must not steal and I must learn,
Nothing is mine that I do not earn.
I must try in work and play
To make things beautiful every day.
I must be kind to everyone,
And never let cruel things be done.
I must be brave, and I must try
When I am hurt never to cry,
And always laugh as much as I can,
And be glad that I’m going to be a man
To work for my living and help the rest
And never do less than my very best.”


“That’s very easy,” said Jane. “_I_ could remember that.”

“That’s only the very beginning, of course,” said the lady; “there are
heaps more rhymes. There’s the one beginning—

“I must not litter the beautiful street
With bits of paper or things to eat;
I must not pick the public flowers,
They are not _mine_, but they are _ours_.”


“And ‘things to eat’ reminds me—are you hungry? Wells, run and get a
tray of nice things.”

“Why do you call him ‘Wells’?” asked Robert, as the boy ran off.

“It’s after the great reformer—surely you’ve heard of _him?_ He lived
in the dark ages, and he saw that what you ought to do is to find out
what you want and then try to get it. Up to then people had always
tried to tinker up what they’d got. We’ve got a great many of the
things he thought of. Then ‘Wells’ means springs of clear water. It’s a
nice name, don’t you think?”

Here Wells returned with strawberries and cakes and lemonade on a tray,
and everybody ate and enjoyed.

“Now, Wells,” said the lady, “run off or you’ll be late and not meet
your Daddy.”

Wells kissed her, waved to the others, and went.

“Look here,” said Anthea suddenly, “would you like to come to _our_
country, and see what it’s like? It wouldn’t take you a minute.”

The lady laughed. But Jane held up the charm and said the word.

“What a splendid conjuring trick!” cried the lady, enchanted with the
beautiful, growing arch.

“Go through,” said Anthea.

The lady went, laughing. But she did not laugh when she found herself,
suddenly, in the dining-room at Fitzroy Street.

“Oh, what a _horrible_ trick!” she cried. “What a hateful, dark, ugly
place!”

She ran to the window and looked out. The sky was grey, the street was
foggy, a dismal organ-grinder was standing opposite the door, a beggar
and a man who sold matches were quarrelling at the edge of the pavement
on whose greasy black surface people hurried along, hastening to get to
the shelter of their houses.

“Oh, look at their faces, their horrible faces!” she cried. “What’s the
matter with them all?”

“They’re poor people, that’s all,” said Robert.

“But it’s _not_ all! They’re ill, they’re unhappy, they’re wicked! Oh,
do stop it, there’s dear children. It’s very, very clever. Some sort of
magic-lantern trick, I suppose, like I’ve read of. But _do_ stop it.
Oh! their poor, tired, miserable, wicked faces!”

The tears were in her eyes. Anthea signed to Jane. The arch grew, they
spoke the words, and pushed the lady through it into her own time and
place, where London is clean and beautiful, and the Thames runs clear
and bright, and the green trees grow, and no one is afraid, or anxious,
or in a hurry.

There was a silence. Then—

“I’m glad we went,” said Anthea, with a deep breath.

“I’ll never throw paper about again as long as I live,” said Robert.

“Mother always told us not to,” said Jane.

“I would like to take up the Duties of Citizenship for a special
subject,” said Cyril. “I wonder if Father could put me through it. I
shall ask him when he comes home.”

“If we’d found the Amulet, Father could be home _now_,” said Anthea,
“and Mother and The Lamb.”

“Let’s go into the future _again_,” suggested Jane brightly. “Perhaps
we could remember if it wasn’t such an awful way off.”

So they did. This time they said, “The future, where the Amulet is, not
so far away.”

And they went through the familiar arch into a large, light room with
three windows. Facing them was the familiar mummy-case. And at a table
by the window sat the learned gentleman. They knew him at once, though
his hair was white. He was one of the faces that do not change with
age. In his hand was the Amulet—complete and perfect.

He rubbed his other hand across his forehead in the way they were so
used to.

“Dreams, dreams!” he said; “old age is full of them!”

“You’ve been in dreams with us before now,” said Robert, “don’t you
remember?”

“I do, indeed,” said he. The room had many more books than the Fitzroy
Street room, and far more curious and wonderful Assyrian and Egyptian
objects. “The most wonderful dreams I ever had had you in them.”

“Where,” asked Cyril, “did you get that thing in your hand?”

“If you weren’t just a dream,” he answered, smiling, you’d remember
that you gave it to me.”

“But where did we get it?” Cyril asked eagerly.

“Ah, you never would tell me that,” he said, “You always had your
little mysteries. You dear children! What a difference you made to that
old Bloomsbury house! I wish I could dream you oftener. Now you’re
grown up you’re not like you used to be.”

“Grown up?” said Anthea.

The learned gentleman pointed to a frame with four photographs in it.

“There you are,” he said.

The children saw four grown-up people’s portraits—two ladies, two
gentlemen—and looked on them with loathing.

“Shall we grow up like _that?_” whispered Jane. “How perfectly horrid!”

“If we’re ever like that, we sha’nn’t know it’s horrid, I expect,”
Anthea with some insight whispered back. “You see, you get used to
yourself while you’re changing. It’s—it’s being so sudden makes it seem
so frightful now.”

The learned gentleman was looking at them with wistful kindness. “Don’t
let me undream you just yet,” he said. There was a pause.

“Do you remember _when_ we gave you that Amulet?” Cyril asked suddenly.

“You know, or you would if you weren’t a dream, that it was on the 3rd
December, 1905. I shall never forget _that_ day.”

“Thank you,” said Cyril, earnestly; “oh, thank you very much.”

“You’ve got a new room,” said Anthea, looking out of the window, “and
what a lovely garden!”

“Yes,” said he, “I’m too old now to care even about being near the
Museum. This is a beautiful place. Do you know—I can hardly believe
you’re just a dream, you do look so exactly real. Do you know...” his
voice dropped, “I can say it to _you_, though, of course, if I said it
to anyone that wasn’t a dream they’d call me mad; there was something
about that Amulet you gave me—something very mysterious.”

“There was that,” said Robert.

“Ah, I don’t mean your pretty little childish mysteries about where you
got it. But about the thing itself. First, the wonderful dreams I used
to have, after you’d shown me the first half of it! Why, my book on
Atlantis, that I did, was the beginning of my fame and my fortune, too.
And I got it all out of a dream! And then, ‘Britain at the Time of the
Roman Invasion’—that was only a pamphlet, but it explained a lot of
things people hadn’t understood.”

“Yes,” said Anthea, “it would.”

“That was the beginning. But after you’d given me the whole of the
Amulet—ah, it was generous of you!—then, somehow, I didn’t need to
theorize, I seemed to _know_ about the old Egyptian civilization. And
they can’t upset my theories”—he rubbed his thin hands and laughed
triumphantly—“they can’t, though they’ve tried. Theories, they call
them, but they’re more like—I don’t know—more like memories. I _know_
I’m right about the secret rites of the Temple of Amen.”

“I’m so glad you’re rich,” said Anthea. “You weren’t, you know, at
Fitzroy Street.”

“Indeed I wasn’t,” said he, “but I am now. This beautiful house and
this lovely garden—I dig in it sometimes; you remember, you used to
tell me to take more exercise? Well, I feel I owe it all to you—and the
Amulet.”

“I’m so glad,” said Anthea, and kissed him. He started.

“_That_ didn’t feel like a dream,” he said, and his voice trembled.

“It isn’t exactly a dream,” said Anthea softly, “it’s all part of the
Amulet—it’s a sort of extra special, real dream, dear Jimmy.”

“Ah,” said he, “when you call me that, I know I’m dreaming. My little
sister—I dream of her sometimes. But it’s not real like this. Do you
remember the day I dreamed you brought me the Babylonish ring?”

“We remember it all,” said Robert. “Did you leave Fitzroy Street
because you were too rich for it?”

“Oh, no!” he said reproachfully. “You know I should never have done
such a thing as that. Of course, I left when your old Nurse died
and—what’s the matter!”

“Old Nurse _dead?_” said Anthea. “Oh, _no!_”

“Yes, yes, it’s the common lot. It’s a long time ago now.”

Jane held up the Amulet in a hand that twittered.

“Come!” she cried, “oh, come home! She may be dead before we get there,
and then we can’t give it to her. Oh, come!”

“Ah, don’t let the dream end now!” pleaded the learned gentleman.

“It must,” said Anthea firmly, and kissed him again.

“When it comes to people dying,” said Robert, “good-bye! I’m so glad
you’re rich and famous and happy.”

“_Do_ come!” cried Jane, stamping in her agony of impatience.

And they went. Old Nurse brought in tea almost as soon as they were
back in Fitzroy Street. As she came in with the tray, the girls rushed
at her and nearly upset her and it.

“Don’t die!” cried Jane, “oh, don’t!” and Anthea cried, “Dear, ducky,
darling old Nurse, don’t die!”

“Lord, love you!” said Nurse, “I’m not agoin’ to die yet a while,
please Heaven! Whatever on earth’s the matter with the chicks?”

“Nothing. Only don’t!”

She put the tray down and hugged the girls in turn. The boys thumped
her on the back with heartfelt affection.

“I’m as well as ever I was in my life,” she said. “What nonsense about
dying! You’ve been a sitting too long in the dusk, that’s what it is.
Regular blind man’s holiday. Leave go of me, while I light the gas.”

The yellow light illuminated four pale faces.

“We do love you so,” Anthea went on, “and we’ve made you a picture to
show you how we love you. Get it out, Squirrel.”

The glazed testimonial was dragged out from under the sofa and
displayed.

“The glue’s not dry yet,” said Cyril, “look out!”

“What a beauty!” cried old Nurse. “Well, I never! And your pictures and
the beautiful writing and all. Well, I always did say your hearts was
in the right place, if a bit careless at times. Well! I never did! I
don’t know as I was ever pleased better in my life.”

She hugged them all, one after the other. And the boys did not mind it,
somehow, that day.

“How is it we can remember all about the future, _now?_” Anthea woke
the Psammead with laborious gentleness to put the question. “How is it
we can remember what we saw in the future, and yet, when we _were_ in
the future, we could not remember the bit of the future that was past
then, the time of finding the Amulet?”

“Why, what a silly question!” said the Psammead, “of course you cannot
remember what hasn’t happened yet.”

“But the _future_ hasn’t happened yet,” Anthea persisted, “and we
remember that all right.”

“Oh, that isn’t what’s happened, my good child,” said the Psammead,
rather crossly, “that’s prophetic vision. And you remember dreams,
don’t you? So why not visions? You never do seem to understand the
simplest thing.”

It went to sand again at once.

Anthea crept down in her nightgown to give one last kiss to old Nurse,
and one last look at the beautiful testimonial hanging, by its tapes,
its glue now firmly set, in glazed glory on the wall of the kitchen.

“Good-night, bless your loving heart,” said old Nurse, “if only you
don’t catch your deather-cold!”




CHAPTER XIII.
THE SHIPWRECK ON THE TIN ISLANDS


“Blue and red,” said Jane softly, “make purple.”

“Not always they don’t,” said Cyril, “it has to be crimson lake and
Prussian blue. If you mix Vermilion and Indigo you get the most
loathsome slate colour.”

“Sepia’s the nastiest colour in the box, I think,” said Jane, sucking
her brush.

They were all painting. Nurse in the flush of grateful emotion, excited
by Robert’s border of poppies, had presented each of the four with a
shilling paint-box, and had supplemented the gift with a pile of old
copies of the _Illustrated London News_.

“Sepia,” said Cyril instructively, “is made out of beastly cuttlefish.”

“Purple’s made out of a fish, as well as out of red and blue,” said
Robert. “Tyrian purple was, I know.”

“Out of lobsters?” said Jane dreamily. “They’re red when they’re
boiled, and blue when they aren’t. If you mixed live and dead lobsters
you’d get Tyrian purple.”

“_I_ shouldn’t like to mix anything with a live lobster,” said Anthea,
shuddering.

“Well, there aren’t any other red and blue fish,” said Jane; “you’d
have to.”

“I’d rather not have the purple,” said Anthea.

“The Tyrian purple wasn’t that colour when it came out of the fish, nor
yet afterwards, it wasn’t,” said Robert; “it was scarlet really, and
Roman Emperors wore it. And it wasn’t any nice colour while the fish
had it. It was a yellowish-white liquid of a creamy consistency.”

“How do you know?” asked Cyril.

“I read it,” said Robert, with the meek pride of superior knowledge.

“Where?” asked Cyril.

“In print,” said Robert, still more proudly meek.

“You think everything’s true if it’s printed,” said Cyril, naturally
annoyed, “but it isn’t. Father said so. Quite a lot of lies get
printed, especially in newspapers.”

“You see, as it happens,” said Robert, in what was really a rather
annoying tone, “it wasn’t a newspaper, it was in a book.”

“How sweet Chinese white is!” said Jane, dreamily sucking her brush
again.

“I don’t believe it,” said Cyril to Robert.

“Have a suck yourself,” suggested Robert.

“I don’t mean about the Chinese white. I mean about the cream fish
turning purple and—”

“Oh!” cried Anthea, jumping up very quickly, “I’m tired of painting.
Let’s go somewhere by Amulet. I say let’s let _it_ choose.”

Cyril and Robert agreed that this was an idea. Jane consented to stop
painting because, as she said, Chinese white, though certainly sweet,
gives you a queer feeling in the back of the throat if you paint with
it too long.

The Amulet was held up.

“Take us somewhere,” said Jane, “anywhere you like in the Past—but
somewhere where you are.” Then she said the word.

Next moment everyone felt a queer rocking and swaying—something like
what you feel when you go out in a fishing boat. And that was not
wonderful, when you come to think of it, for it was in a boat that they
found themselves. A queer boat, with high bulwarks pierced with holes
for oars to go through. There was a high seat for the steersman, and
the prow was shaped like the head of some great animal with big,
staring eyes. The boat rode at anchor in a bay, and the bay was very
smooth. The crew were dark, wiry fellows with black beards and hair.
They had no clothes except a tunic from waist to knee, and round caps
with knobs on the top. They were very busy, and what they were doing
was so interesting to the children that at first they did not even
wonder where the Amulet had brought them.

And the crew seemed too busy to notice the children. They were
fastening rush baskets to a long rope with a great piece of cork at the
end, and in each basket they put mussels or little frogs. Then they
cast out the rope, the baskets sank, but the cork floated. And all
about on the blue water were other boats and all the crews of all the
boats were busy with ropes and baskets and frogs and mussels.

“Whatever are you doing?” Jane suddenly asked a man who had rather more
clothes than the others, and seemed to be a sort of captain or
overseer. He started and stared at her, but he had seen too many
strange lands to be very much surprised at these queerly-dressed
stowaways.

“Setting lines for the dye shell-fish,” he said shortly. “How did you
get here?”

“A sort of magic,” said Robert carelessly. The Captain fingered an
Amulet that hung round his neck.

“What is this place?” asked Cyril.

“Tyre, of course,” said the man. Then he drew back and spoke in a low
voice to one of the sailors.

“Now we shall know about your precious cream-jug fish,” said Cyril.

“But we never _said_ come to Tyre,” said Jane.

“The Amulet heard us talking, I expect. I think it’s _most_ obliging of
it,” said Anthea.

“And the Amulet’s here too,” said Robert. “We ought to be able to find
it in a little ship like this. I wonder which of them’s got it.”

“Oh—look, look!” cried Anthea suddenly. On the bare breast of one of
the sailors gleamed something red. It was the exact counterpart of
their precious half-Amulet.

A silence, full of emotion, was broken by Jane.

“Then we’ve found it!” she said. “Oh do let’s take it and go home!”

“Easy to say ‘take it’,” said Cyril; “he looks very strong.”

He did—yet not so strong as the other sailors.

“It’s odd,” said Anthea musingly, “I do believe I’ve seen that man
somewhere before.”

“He’s rather like our learned gentleman,” said Robert, “but I’ll tell
you who he’s much more like—”

At this moment that sailor looked up. His eyes met Robert’s—and Robert
and the others had no longer any doubt as to where they had seen him
before. It was Rekh-marā, the priest who had led them to the palace of
Pharaoh—and whom Jane had looked back at through the arch, when he was
counselling Pharaoh’s guard to take the jewels and fly for his life.

Nobody was quite pleased, and nobody quite knew why.

Jane voiced the feelings of all when she said, fingering _their_ Amulet
through the folds of her frock, “We can go back in a minute if anything
nasty happens.”

For the moment nothing worse happened than an offer of food—figs and
cucumbers it was, and very pleasant.

“I see,” said the Captain, “that you are from a far country. Since you
have honoured my boat by appearing on it, you must stay here till
morning. Then I will lead you to one of our great ones. He loves
strangers from far lands.”

“Let’s go home,” Jane whispered, “all the frogs are drowning _now_. I
think the people here are cruel.”

But the boys wanted to stay and see the lines taken up in the morning.

“It’s just like eel-pots and lobster-pots,” said Cyril, “the baskets
only open from outside—I vote we stay.”

So they stayed.

“That’s Tyre over there,” said the Captain, who was evidently trying to
be civil. He pointed to a great island rock, that rose steeply from the
sea, crowned with huge walls and towers. There was another city on the
mainland.

“That’s part of Tyre, too,” said the Captain; “it’s where the great
merchants have their pleasure-houses and gardens and farms.”

“Look, look!” Cyril cried suddenly; “what a lovely little ship!”

A ship in full sail was passing swiftly through the fishing fleet. The
Captain’s face changed. He frowned, and his eyes blazed with fury.

“Insolent young barbarian!” he cried. “Do you call the ships of Tyre
_little?_ None greater sail the seas. That ship has been on a three
years’ voyage. She is known in all the great trading ports from here to
the Tin Islands. She comes back rich and glorious. Her very anchor is
of silver.”

“I’m sure we beg your pardon,” said Anthea hastily. “In our country we
say ‘little’ for a pet name. Your wife might call you her dear little
husband, you know.”

“I should like to catch her at it,” growled the Captain, but he stopped
scowling.

“It’s a rich trade,” he went on. “For cloth _once_ dipped, second-best
glass, and the rough images our young artists carve for practice, the
barbarian King in Tessos lets us work the silver mines. We get so much
silver there that we leave them our iron anchors and come back with
silver ones.”

“How splendid!” said Robert. “Do go on. What’s cloth once dipped?”

“You _must_ be barbarians from the outer darkness,” said the Captain
scornfully. “All wealthy nations know that our finest stuffs are twice
dyed—dibaptha. They’re only for the robes of kings and priests and
princes.”

“What do the rich merchants wear,” asked Jane, with interest, “in the
pleasure-houses?”

“They wear the dibaptha. _Our_ merchants _are_ princes,” scowled the
skipper.

“Oh, don’t be cross, we do so like hearing about things. We want to
know _all_ about the dyeing,” said Anthea cordially.

“Oh, you do, do you?” growled the man. “So that’s what you’re here for?
Well, you won’t get the secrets of the dye trade out of _me_.”

He went away, and everyone felt snubbed and uncomfortable. And all the
time the long, narrow eyes of the Egyptian were watching, watching.
They felt as though he was watching them through the darkness, when
they lay down to sleep on a pile of cloaks.

Next morning the baskets were drawn up full of what looked like whelk
shells.

The children were rather in the way, but they made themselves as small
as they could. While the skipper was at the other end of the boat they
did ask one question of a sailor, whose face was a little less unkind
than the others.

“Yes,” he answered, “this is the dye-fish. It’s a sort of murex—and
there’s another kind that they catch at Sidon and then, of course,
there’s the kind that’s used for the dibaptha. But that’s quite
different. It’s—”

“Hold your tongue!” shouted the skipper. And the man held it.

The laden boat was rowed slowly round the end of the island, and was
made fast in one of the two great harbours that lay inside a long
breakwater. The harbour was full of all sorts of ships, so that Cyril
and Robert enjoyed themselves much more than their sisters. The
breakwater and the quays were heaped with bales and baskets, and
crowded with slaves and sailors. Farther along some men were practising
diving.

“That’s jolly good,” said Robert, as a naked brown body cleft the
water.

“I should think so,” said the skipper. “The pearl-divers of Persia are
not more skilful. Why, we’ve got a fresh-water spring that comes out at
the bottom of the sea. Our divers dive down and bring up the fresh
water in skin bottles! Can your barbarian divers do as much?”

“I suppose not,” said Robert, and put away a wild desire to explain to
the Captain the English system of waterworks, pipes, taps, and the
intricacies of the plumbers’ trade.

As they neared the quay the skipper made a hasty toilet. He did his
hair, combed his beard, put on a garment like a jersey with short
sleeves, an embroidered belt, a necklace of beads, and a big signet
ring.

“Now,” said he, “I’m fit to be seen. Come along?”

“Where to?” said Jane cautiously.

“To Pheles, the great sea-captain, said the skipper, “the man I told
you of, who loves barbarians.”

Then Rekh-marā came forward, and, for the first time, spoke.

“I have known these children in another land,” he said. “You know my
powers of magic. It was my magic that brought these barbarians to your
boat. And you know how they will profit you. I read your thoughts. Let
me come with you and see the end of them, and then I will work the
spell I promised you in return for the little experience you have so
kindly given me on your boat.”

The skipper looked at the Egyptian with some disfavour.

“So it was _your_ doing,” he said. “I might have guessed it. Well, come
on.”

So he came, and the girls wished he hadn’t. But Robert whispered—

“Nonsense—as long as he’s with us we’ve got _some_ chance of the
Amulet. We can always fly if anything goes wrong.”

The morning was so fresh and bright; their breakfast had been so good
and so unusual; they had actually seen the Amulet round the Egyptian’s
neck. One or two, or all these things, suddenly raised the children’s
spirits. They went off quite cheerfully through the city gate—it was
not arched, but roofed over with a great flat stone—and so through the
street, which smelt horribly of fish and garlic and a thousand other
things even less agreeable. But far worse than the street scents was
the scent of the factory, where the skipper called in to sell his
night’s catch. I wish I could tell you all about that factory, but I
haven’t time, and perhaps after all you aren’t interested in dyeing
works. I will only mention that Robert was triumphantly proved to be
right. The dye _was_ a yellowish-white liquid of a creamy consistency,
and it smelt more strongly of garlic than garlic itself does.

While the skipper was bargaining with the master of the dye works the
Egyptian came close to the children, and said, suddenly and softly—

“Trust me.”

“I wish we could,” said Anthea.

“You feel,” said the Egyptian, “that I want your Amulet. That makes you
distrust me.”

“Yes,” said Cyril bluntly.

“But you also, you want my Amulet, and I am trusting you.”

“There’s something in that,” said Robert.

“We have the two halves of the Amulet,” said the Priest, “but not yet
the pin that joined them. Our only chance of getting that is to remain
together. Once part these two halves and they may never be found in the
same time and place. Be wise. Our interests are the same.”

Before anyone could say more the skipper came back, and with him the
dye-master. His hair and beard were curled like the men’s in Babylon,
and he was dressed like the skipper, but with added grandeur of gold
and embroidery. He had necklaces of beads and silver, and a glass
amulet with a man’s face, very like his own, set between two bull’s
heads, as well as gold and silver bracelets and armlets. He looked
keenly at the children. Then he said—

“My brother Pheles has just come back from Tarshish. He’s at his garden
house—unless he’s hunting wild boar in the marshes. He gets frightfully
bored on shore.”

“Ah,” said the skipper, “he’s a true-born Phoenician. ‘Tyre, Tyre for
ever! Oh, Tyre rules the waves!’ as the old song says. I’ll go at once,
and show him my young barbarians.”

“I should,” said the dye-master. “They are very rum, aren’t they? What
frightful clothes, and what a lot of them! Observe the covering of
their feet. Hideous indeed.”

Robert could not help thinking how easy, and at the same time pleasant,
it would be to catch hold of the dye-master’s feet and tip him backward
into the great sunken vat just near him. But if he had, flight would
have had to be the next move, so he restrained his impulse.

There was something about this Tyrian adventure that was different from
all the others. It was, somehow, calmer. And there was the undoubted
fact that the charm was there on the neck of the Egyptian.

So they enjoyed everything to the full, the row from the Island City to
the shore, the ride on the donkeys that the skipper hired at the gate
of the mainland city, and the pleasant country—palms and figs and
cedars all about. It was like a garden—clematis, honeysuckle, and
jasmine clung about the olive and mulberry trees, and there were tulips
and gladiolus, and clumps of mandrake, which has bell-flowers that look
as though they were cut out of dark blue jewels. In the distance were
the mountains of Lebanon.

The house they came to at last was rather like a bungalow—long and low,
with pillars all along the front. Cedars and sycamores grew near it and
sheltered it pleasantly.

Everyone dismounted, and the donkeys were led away.

“Why is this like Rosherville?” whispered Robert, and instantly
supplied the answer.

“Because it’s the place to spend a happy day.”

“It’s jolly decent of the skipper to have brought us to such a ripping
place,” said Cyril.

“Do you know,” said Anthea, “this feels more real than anything else
we’ve seen? It’s like a holiday in the country at home.”

The children were left alone in a large hall. The floor was mosaic,
done with wonderful pictures of ships and sea-beasts and fishes.
Through an open doorway they could see a pleasant courtyard with
flowers.

“I should like to spend a week here,” said Jane, “and donkey ride every
day.”

Everyone was feeling very jolly. Even the Egyptian looked pleasanter
than usual. And then, quite suddenly, the skipper came back with a
joyous smile. With him came the master of the house. He looked steadily
at the children and nodded twice.

“Yes,” he said, “my steward will pay you the price. But I shall not pay
at that high rate for the Egyptian dog.”

The two passed on.

“This,” said the Egyptian, “is a pretty kettle of fish.”

“What is?” asked all the children at once.

“Our present position,” said Rekh-marā. “Our seafaring friend,” he
added, “has sold us all for slaves!”

A hasty council succeeded the shock of this announcement. The Priest
was allowed to take part in it. His advice was “stay”, because they
were in no danger, and the Amulet in its completeness must be somewhere
near, or, of course, they could not have come to that place at all. And
after some discussion they agreed to this.

The children were treated more as guests than as slaves, but the
Egyptian was sent to the kitchen and made to work.

Pheles, the master of the house, went off that very evening, by the
King’s orders, to start on another voyage. And when he was gone his
wife found the children amusing company, and kept them talking and
singing and dancing till quite late. “To distract my mind from my
sorrows,” she said.

“I do like being a slave,” remarked Jane cheerfully, as they curled up
on the big, soft cushions that were to be their beds.

It was black night when they were awakened, each by a hand passed
softly over its face, and a low voice that whispered—

“Be quiet, or all is lost.”

So they were quiet.

“It’s me, Rekh-marā, the Priest of Amen,” said the whisperer. “The man
who brought us has gone to sea again, and he has taken my Amulet from
me by force, and I know no magic to get it back. Is there magic for
that in the Amulet you bear?”

Everyone was instantly awake by now.

“We can go after him,” said Cyril, leaping up; “but he might take
_ours_ as well; or he might be angry with us for following him.”

“I’ll see to _that_,” said the Egyptian in the dark. “Hide your Amulet
well.”

There in the deep blackness of that room in the Tyrian country house
the Amulet was once more held up and the word spoken.

All passed through on to a ship that tossed and tumbled on a wind-blown
sea. They crouched together there till morning, and Jane and Cyril were
not at all well. When the dawn showed, dove-coloured, across the steely
waves, they stood up as well as they could for the tumbling of the
ship. Pheles, that hardy sailor and adventurer, turned quite pale when
he turned round suddenly and saw them.

“Well!” he said, “well, I never did!”

“Master,” said the Egyptian, bowing low, and that was even more
difficult than standing up, “we are here by the magic of the sacred
Amulet that hangs round your neck.”

“I never did!” repeated Pheles. “Well, well!”

“What port is the ship bound for?” asked Robert, with a nautical air.

But Pheles said, “Are you a navigator?” Robert had to own that he was
not.

“Then,” said Pheles, “I don’t mind telling you that we’re bound for the
Tin Isles. Tyre alone knows where the Tin Isles are. It is a splendid
secret we keep from all the world. It is as great a thing to us as your
magic to you.”

He spoke in quite a new voice, and seemed to respect both the children
and the Amulet a good deal more than he had done before.

“The King sent you, didn’t he?” said Jane.

“Yes,” answered Pheles, “he bade me set sail with half a score brave
gentlemen and this crew. You shall go with us, and see many wonders.”
He bowed and left them.

“What are we going to do now?” said Robert, when Pheles had caused them
to be left along with a breakfast of dried fruits and a sort of hard
biscuit.

“Wait till he lands in the Tin Isles,” said Rekh-marā, “then we can get
the barbarians to help us. We will attack him by night and tear the
sacred Amulet from his accursed heathen neck,” he added, grinding his
teeth.

“When shall we get to the Tin Isles?” asked Jane.

“Oh—six months, perhaps, or a year,” said the Egyptian cheerfully.

“A _year_ of this?” cried Jane, and Cyril, who was still feeling far
too unwell to care about breakfast, hugged himself miserably and
shuddered.

It was Robert who said—

“Look here, we can shorten that year. Jane, out with the Amulet! Wish
that we were where the Amulet will be when the ship is twenty miles
from the Tin Island. That’ll give us time to mature our plans.”

It was done—the work of a moment—and there they were on the same ship,
between grey northern sky and grey northern sea. The sun was setting in
a pale yellow line. It was the same ship, but it was changed, and so
were the crew. Weather-worn and dirty were the sailors, and their
clothes torn and ragged. And the children saw that, of course, though
they had skipped the nine months, the ship had had to live through
them. Pheles looked thinner, and his face was rugged and anxious.

“Ha!” he cried, “the charm has brought you back! I have prayed to it
daily these nine months—and now you are here? Have you no magic that
can help?”

“What is your need?” asked the Egyptian quietly.

“I need a great wave that shall whelm away the foreign ship that
follows us. A month ago it lay in wait for us, by the pillars of the
gods, and it follows, follows, to find out the secret of Tyre—the place
of the Tin Islands. If I could steer by night I could escape them yet,
but tonight there will be no stars.”

“My magic will not serve you here,” said the Egyptian.

But Robert said, “My magic will not bring up great waves, but I can
show you how to steer without stars.”

He took out the shilling compass, still, fortunately, in working order,
that he had bought off another boy at school for fivepence, a piece of
indiarubber, a strip of whalebone, and half a stick of red sealing-wax.

And he showed Pheles how it worked. And Pheles wondered at the
compass’s magic truth.

“I will give it to you,” Robert said, “in return for that charm about
your neck.”

Pheles made no answer. He first laughed, snatched the compass from
Robert’s hand, and turned away still laughing.

“Be comforted,” the Priest whispered, “our time will come.”

The dusk deepened, and Pheles, crouched beside a dim lantern, steered
by the shilling compass from the Crystal Palace.

No one ever knew how the other ship sailed, but suddenly, in the deep
night, the look-out man at the stern cried out in a terrible voice—

“She is close upon us!”

“And we,” said Pheles, “are close to the harbour.” He was silent a
moment, then suddenly he altered the ship’s course, and then he stood
up and spoke.

“Good friends and gentlemen,” he said, “who are bound with me in this
brave venture by our King’s command, the false, foreign ship is close
on our heels. If we land, they land, and only the gods know whether
they might not beat us in fight, and themselves survive to carry back
the tale of Tyre’s secret island to enrich their own miserable land.
Shall this be?”

“Never!” cried the half-dozen men near him. The slaves were rowing hard
below and could not hear his words.

The Egyptian leaped upon him; suddenly, fiercely, as a wild beast
leaps. “Give me back my Amulet,” he cried, and caught at the charm. The
chain that held it snapped, and it lay in the Priest’s hand.

Pheles laughed, standing balanced to the leap of the ship that answered
the oarstroke.

“This is no time for charms and mummeries,” he said. “We’ve lived like
men, and we’ll die like gentlemen for the honour and glory of Tyre, our
splendid city. ‘Tyre, Tyre for ever! It’s Tyre that rules the waves.’ I
steer her straight for the Dragon rocks, and we go down for our city,
as brave men should. The creeping cowards who follow shall go down as
slaves—and slaves they shall be to us—when we live again. Tyre, Tyre
for ever!”

A great shout went up, and the slaves below joined in it.

“Quick, the Amulet,” cried Anthea, and held it up. Rekh-marā held up
the one he had snatched from Pheles. The word was spoken, and the two
great arches grew on the plunging ship in the shrieking wind under the
dark sky. From each Amulet a great and beautiful green light streamed
and shone far out over the waves. It illuminated, too, the black faces
and jagged teeth of the great rocks that lay not two ships’ lengths
from the boat’s peaked nose.

“Tyre, Tyre for ever! It’s Tyre that rules the waves!” the voices of
the doomed rose in a triumphant shout. The children scrambled through
the arch, and stood trembling and blinking in the Fitzroy Street
parlour, and in their ears still sounded the whistle of the wind, and
the rattle of the oars, the crash of the ships bow on the rocks, and
the last shout of the brave gentlemen-adventurers who went to their
deaths singing, for the sake of the city they loved.

“And so we’ve lost the other half of the Amulet again,” said Anthea,
when they had told the Psammead all about it.

“Nonsense, pooh!” said the Psammead. “That wasn’t the other half. It
was the same half that you’ve got—the one that wasn’t crushed and
lost.”

“But how could it be the same?” said Anthea gently.

“Well, not exactly, of course. The one you’ve got is a good many years
older, but at any rate it’s not the other one. What did you say when
you wished?”

“I forget,” said Jane.

“I don’t,” said the Psammead. “You said, ‘Take us where _you_ are’—and
it did, so you see it was the same half.”

“I see,” said Anthea.

“But you mark my words,” the Psammead went on, “you’ll have trouble
with that Priest yet.”

“Why, he was quite friendly,” said Anthea.

“All the same you’d better beware of the Reverend Rekh-marā.”

“Oh, I’m sick of the Amulet,” said Cyril, “we shall never get it.”

“Oh yes we shall,” said Robert. “Don’t you remember December 3rd?”

“Jinks!” said Cyril, “I’d forgotten that.”

“I don’t believe it,” said Jane, “and I don’t feel at all well.”

“If I were you,” said the Psammead, “I should not go out into the Past
again till that date. You’ll find it safer not to go where you’re
likely to meet that Egyptian any more just at present.”

“Of course we’ll do as you say,” said Anthea soothingly, “though
there’s something about his face that I really do like.”

“Still, you don’t want to run after him, I suppose,” snapped the
Psammead. “You wait till the 3rd, and then see what happens.”

Cyril and Jane were feeling far from well, Anthea was always obliging,
so Robert was overruled. And they promised. And none of them, not even
the Psammead, at all foresaw, as you no doubt do quite plainly, exactly
what it was that _would_ happen on that memorable date.




CHAPTER XIV.
THE HEART’S DESIRE


If I only had time I could tell you lots of things. For instance, how,
in spite of the advice of the Psammead, the four children did, one very
wet day, go through their Amulet Arch into the golden desert, and there
find the great Temple of Baalbec and meet with the Phœnix whom they
never thought to see again. And how the Phœnix did not remember them at
all until it went into a sort of prophetic trance—if that can be called
remembering. But, alas! I _haven’t_ time, so I must leave all that out
though it was a wonderfully thrilling adventure. I must leave out, too,
all about the visit of the children to the Hippodrome with the Psammead
in its travelling bag, and about how the wishes of the people round
about them were granted so suddenly and surprisingly that at last the
Psammead had to be taken hurriedly home by Anthea, who consequently
missed half the performance. Then there was the time when, Nurse having
gone to tea with a friend out Ivalunk way, they were playing “devil in
the dark”—and in the midst of that most creepy pastime the postman’s
knock frightened Jane nearly out of her life. She took in the letters,
however, and put them in the back of the hat-stand drawer, so that they
should be safe. And safe they were, for she never thought of them again
for weeks and weeks.

One really good thing happened when they took the Psammead to a
magic-lantern show and lecture at the boys’ school at Camden Town. The
lecture was all about our soldiers in South Africa. And the lecturer
ended up by saying, “And I hope every boy in this room has in his heart
the seeds of courage and heroism and self-sacrifice, and I wish that
every one of you may grow up to be noble and brave and unselfish,
worthy citizens of this great Empire for whom our soldiers have freely
given their lives.”

And, of course, this came true—which was a distinct score for Camden
Town.

As Anthea said, it was unlucky that the lecturer said boys, because now
she and Jane would have to be noble and unselfish, if at all, without
any outside help. But Jane said, “I daresay we are already because of
our beautiful natures. It’s only boys that have to be made brave by
magic”—which nearly led to a first-class row.

And I daresay you would like to know all about the affair of the
fishing rod, and the fish-hooks, and the cook next door—which was
amusing from some points of view, though not perhaps the cook’s—but
there really is no time even for that.

The only thing that there’s time to tell about is the Adventure of
Maskelyne and Cooke’s, and the Unexpected Apparition—which is also the
beginning of the end.

It was Nurse who broke into the gloomy music of the autumn rain on the
window panes by suggesting a visit to the Egyptian Hall, England’s Home
of Mystery. Though they had good, but private reasons to know that
their own particular personal mystery was of a very different brand,
the four all brightened at the idea. All children, as well as a good
many grown-ups, love conjuring.

“It’s in Piccadilly,” said old Nurse, carefully counting out the proper
number of shillings into Cyril’s hand, “not so very far down on the
left from the Circus. There’s big pillars outside, something like
Carter’s seed place in Holborn, as used to be Day and Martin’s blacking
when I was a gell. And something like Euston Station, only not so big.”

“Yes, I know,” said everybody.

So they started.

But though they walked along the left-hand side of Piccadilly they saw
no pillared building that was at all like Carter’s seed warehouse or
Euston Station or England’s Home of Mystery as they remembered it.

At last they stopped a hurried lady, and asked her the way to Maskelyne
and Cooke’s.

“I don’t know, I’m sure,” she said, pushing past them. “I always shop
at the Stores.” Which just shows, as Jane said, how ignorant grown-up
people are.

It was a policeman who at last explained to them that England’s
Mysteries are now appropriately enough enacted at St George’s Hall. So
they tramped to Langham Place, and missed the first two items in the
programme. But they were in time for the most wonderful magic
appearances and disappearances, which they could hardly believe—even
with all their knowledge of a larger magic—was not really magic after
all.

“If only the Babylonians could have seen _this_ conjuring,” whispered
Cyril. “It takes the shine out of their old conjurer, doesn’t it?”

“Hush!” said Anthea and several other members of the audience.

Now there was a vacant seat next to Robert. And it was when all eyes
were fixed on the stage where Mr Devant was pouring out glasses of all
sorts of different things to drink, out of one kettle with one spout,
and the audience were delightedly tasting them, that Robert felt
someone in that vacant seat. He did not feel someone sit down in it. It
was just that one moment there was no one sitting there, and the next
moment, suddenly, there was someone.

Robert turned. The someone who had suddenly filled that empty place was
Rekh-marā, the Priest of Amen!

Though the eyes of the audience were fixed on Mr David Devant, Mr David
Devant’s eyes were fixed on the audience. And it happened that his eyes
were more particularly fixed on that empty chair. So that he saw quite
plainly the sudden appearance, from nowhere, of the Egyptian Priest.

“A jolly good trick,” he said to himself, “and worked under my own
eyes, in my own hall. I’ll find out how that’s done.” He had never seen
a trick that he could not do himself if he tried.

By this time a good many eyes in the audience had turned on the
clean-shaven, curiously-dressed figure of the Egyptian Priest.

“Ladies and gentlemen,” said Mr Devant, rising to the occasion, “this
is a trick I have never before performed. The empty seat, third from
the end, second row, gallery—you will now find occupied by an Ancient
Egyptian, warranted genuine.”

He little knew how true his words were.

And now all eyes were turned on the Priest and the children, and the
whole audience, after a moment’s breathless surprise, shouted applause.
Only the lady on the other side of Rekh-marā drew back a little. She
_knew_ no one had passed her, and, as she said later, over tea and cold
tongue, “it was that sudden it made her flesh creep.”

Rekh-marā seemed very much annoyed at the notice he was exciting.

“Come out of this crowd,” he whispered to Robert. “I must talk with you
apart.”

“Oh, no,” Jane whispered. “I did so want to see the Mascot Moth, and
the Ventriloquist.”

“How did you get here?” was Robert’s return whisper.

“How did you get to Egypt and to Tyre?” retorted Rekh-marā. “Come, let
us leave this crowd.”

“There’s no help for it, I suppose,” Robert shrugged angrily. But they
all got up.

“Confederates!” said a man in the row behind. “Now they go round to the
back and take part in the next scene.”

“I wish we did,” said Robert.

“Confederate yourself!” said Cyril. And so they got away, the audience
applauding to the last.

In the vestibule of St George’s Hall they disguised Rekh-marā as well
as they could, but even with Robert’s hat and Cyril’s Inverness cape he
was too striking a figure for foot-exercise in the London streets. It
had to be a cab, and it took the last, least money of all of them. They
stopped the cab a few doors from home, and then the girls went in and
engaged old Nurse’s attention by an account of the conjuring and a
fervent entreaty for dripping-toast with their tea, leaving the front
door open so that while Nurse was talking to them the boys could creep
quietly in with Rekh-marā and smuggle him, unseen, up the stairs into
their bedroom.

When the girls came up they found the Egyptian Priest sitting on the
side of Cyril’s bed, his hands on his knees, looking like a statue of a
king.

“Come on,” said Cyril impatiently. “He won’t begin till we’re all here.
And shut the door, can’t you?”

When the door was shut the Egyptian said—

“My interests and yours are one.”

“Very interesting,” said Cyril, “and it’ll be a jolly sight more
interesting if you keep following us about in a decent country with no
more clothes on than _that!_”

“Peace,” said the Priest. “What is this country? and what is this
_time?_”

“The country’s England,” said Anthea, “and the time’s about 6,000 years
later than _your_ time.”

“The Amulet, then,” said the Priest, deeply thoughtful, “gives the
power to move to and fro in time as well as in space?”

“That’s about it,” said Cyril gruffly. “Look here, it’ll be tea-time
directly. What are we to do with you?”

“You have one-half of the Amulet, I the other,” said Rekh-marā. “All
that is now needed is the pin to join them.”

“Don’t you think it,” said Robert. “The half you’ve got is the same
half as the one we’ve got.”

“But the same thing cannot be in the same place and the same time, and
yet be not one, but twain,” said the Priest. “See, here is my half.” He
laid it on the Marcella counterpane. “Where is yours?”

Jane watching the eyes of the others, unfastened the string of the
Amulet and laid it on the bed, but too far off for the Priest to seize
it, even if he had been so dishonourable. Cyril and Robert stood beside
him, ready to spring on him if one of his hands had moved but ever so
little towards the magic treasure that was theirs. But his hands did
not move, only his eyes opened very wide, and so did everyone else’s
for the Amulet the Priest had now quivered and shook; and then, as
steel is drawn to the magnet, it was drawn across the white
counterpane, nearer and nearer to the Amulet, warm from the neck of
Jane. And then, as one drop of water mingles with another on a
rain-wrinkled window-pane, as one bead of quick-silver is drawn into
another bead, Rekh-marā’s Amulet slipped into the other one, and,
behold! there was no more but the one Amulet!

“Black magic!” cried Rekh-marā, and sprang forward to snatch the Amulet
that had swallowed his. But Anthea caught it up, and at the same moment
the Priest was jerked back by a rope thrown over his head. It drew,
tightened with the pull of his forward leap, and bound his elbows to
his sides. Before he had time to use his strength to free himself,
Robert had knotted the cord behind him and tied it to the bedpost. Then
the four children, overcoming the priest’s wrigglings and kickings,
tied his legs with more rope.

“I thought,” said Robert, breathing hard, and drawing the last knot
tight, “he’d have a try for _Ours_, so I got the ropes out of the
box-room, so as to be ready.”

The girls, with rather white faces, applauded his foresight.

“Loosen these bonds!” cried Rekh-marā in fury, “before I blast you with
the seven secret curses of Amen-Rā!”

“We shouldn’t be likely to loose them _after_,” Robert retorted.

“Oh, don’t quarrel!” said Anthea desperately. “Look here, he _has_ just
as much right to the thing as we have. This,” she took up the Amulet
that had swallowed the other one, “this has got his in it as well as
being ours. Let’s go shares.”

“Let me go!” cried the Priest, writhing.

“Now, look here,” said Robert, “if you make a row we can just open that
window and call the police—the guards, you know—and tell them you’ve
been trying to rob us. _Now_ will you shut up and listen to reason?”

“I suppose so,” said Rekh-marā sulkily.

But reason could not be spoken to him till a whispered counsel had been
held in the far corner by the washhand-stand and the towel-horse, a
counsel rather long and very earnest.

At last Anthea detached herself from the group, and went back to the
Priest.

“Look here,” she said in her kind little voice, “we want to be friends.
We want to help you. Let’s make a treaty. Let’s join together to _get_
the Amulet—the whole one, I mean. And then it shall belong to you as
much as to us, and we shall all get our hearts’ desire.”

“Fair words,” said the Priest, “grow no onions.”

“_We_ say, ‘Butter no parsnips’,” Jane put in. “But don’t you see we
_want_ to be fair? Only we want to bind you in the chains of honour and
upright dealing.”

“Will you deal fairly by us?” said Robert.

“I will,” said the Priest. “By the sacred, secret name that is written
under the Altar of Amen-Rā, I will deal fairly by you. Will you, too,
take the oath of honourable partnership?”

“No,” said Anthea, on the instant, and added rather rashly, “We don’t
swear in England, except in police courts, where the guards are, you
know, and you don’t want to go there. But when we _say_ we’ll do a
thing—it’s the same as an oath to us—we do it. You trust us, and we’ll
trust you.” She began to unbind his legs, and the boys hastened to
untie his arms.

When he was free he stood up, stretched his arms, and laughed.

“Now,” he said, “I am stronger than you and my oath is void. I have
sworn by nothing, and my oath is nothing likewise. For there _is_ no
secret, sacred name under the altar of Amen-Rā.”

“Oh, yes there is!” said a voice from under the bed. Everyone
started—Rekh-marā most of all.

Cyril stooped and pulled out the bath of sand where the Psammead slept.

“You don’t know everything, though you _are_ a Divine Father of the
Temple of Amen,” said the Psammead shaking itself till the sand fell
tinkling on the bath edge. “There _is_ a secret, sacred name beneath
the altar of Amen-Rā. Shall I call on that name?”

“No, no!” cried the Priest in terror. “No,” said Jane, too. “Don’t
let’s have any calling names.”

“Besides,” said Rekh-marā, who had turned very white indeed under his
natural brownness, “I was only going to say that though there isn’t any
name under—”

“There _is_,” said the Psammead threateningly.

“Well, even if there _wasn’t_, I will be bound by the wordless oath of
your strangely upright land, and having said that I will be your
friend—I will be it.”

“Then that’s all right,” said the Psammead; “and there’s the tea-bell.
What are you going to do with your distinguished partner? He can’t go
down to tea like that, you know.”

“You see we can’t do anything till the 3rd of December,” said Anthea,
“that’s when we are to find the whole charm. What can we do with
Rekh-marā till then?”

“Box-room,” said Cyril briefly, “and smuggle up his meals. It will be
rather fun.”

“Like a fleeing Cavalier concealed from exasperated Roundheads,” said
Robert. “Yes.”

So Rekh-marā was taken up to the box-room and made as comfortable as
possible in a snug nook between an old nursery fender and the wreck of
a big four-poster. They gave him a big rag-bag to sit on, and an old,
moth-eaten fur coat off the nail on the door to keep him warm. And when
they had had their own tea they took him some. He did not like the tea
at all, but he liked the bread and butter, and cake that went with it.
They took it in turns to sit with him during the evening, and left him
fairly happy and quite settled for the night.

But when they went up in the morning with a kipper, a quarter of which
each of them had gone without at breakfast, Rekh-marā was gone! There
was the cosy corner with the rag-bag, and the moth-eaten fur coat—but
the cosy corner was empty.

“Good riddance!” was naturally the first delightful thought in each
mind. The second was less pleasing, because everyone at once remembered
that since his Amulet had been swallowed up by theirs—which hung once
more round the neck of Jane—he could have no possible means of
returning to his Egyptian past. Therefore he must be still in England,
and probably somewhere quite near them, plotting mischief.

The attic was searched, to prevent mistakes, but quite vainly.

“The best thing we can do,” said Cyril, “is to go through the half
Amulet straight away, get the whole Amulet, and come back.”

“I don’t know,” Anthea hesitated. “Would that be quite fair? Perhaps he
isn’t really a base deceiver. Perhaps something’s happened to him.”

“Happened?” said Cyril, “not it! Besides, what _could_ happen?”

“I don’t know,” said Anthea. “Perhaps burglars came in the night, and
accidentally killed him, and took away the—all that was mortal of him,
you know—to avoid discovery.”

“Or perhaps,” said Cyril, “they hid the—all that was mortal, in one of
those big trunks in the box-room. _Shall we go back and look?_” he
added grimly.

“No, no!” Jane shuddered. “Let’s go and tell the Psammead and see what
it says.”

“No,” said Anthea, “let’s ask the learned gentleman. If anything _has_
happened to Rekh-marā a gentleman’s advice would be more useful than a
Psammead’s. And the learned gentleman’ll only think it’s a dream, like
he always does.”

They tapped at the door, and on the “Come in” entered. The learned
gentleman was sitting in front of his untasted breakfast. Opposite him,
in the easy chair, sat Rekh-marā!

“Hush!” said the learned gentleman very earnestly, “please, hush! or
the dream will go. I am learning... Oh, what have I not learned in the
last hour!”

“In the grey dawn,” said the Priest, “I left my hiding-place, and
finding myself among these treasures from my own country, I remained. I
feel more at home here somehow.”

“Of course I know it’s a dream,” said the learned gentleman feverishly,
“but, oh, ye gods! what a dream! By Jove!...”

“Call not upon the gods,” said the Priest, “lest ye raise greater ones
than ye can control. Already,” he explained to the children, “he and I
are as brothers, and his welfare is dear to me as my own.”

“He has told me,” the learned gentleman began, but Robert interrupted.
This was no moment for manners.

“Have you told him,” he asked the Priest, “all about the Amulet?”

“No,” said Rekh-marā.

“Then tell him now. He is very learned. Perhaps he can tell us what to
do.”

Rekh-marā hesitated, then told—and, oddly enough, none of the children
ever could remember afterwards what it was that he did tell. Perhaps he
used some magic to prevent their remembering.

When he had done the learned gentleman was silent, leaning his elbow on
the table and his head on his hand.

“Dear Jimmy,” said Anthea gently, “don’t worry about it. We are sure to
find it today, somehow.”

“Yes,” said Rekh-marā, “and perhaps, with it, Death.”

“It’s to bring us our hearts’ desire,” said Robert.

“Who knows,” said the Priest, “what things undreamed-of and infinitely
desirable lie beyond the dark gates?”

“Oh, _don’t_,” said Jane, almost whimpering.

The learned gentleman raised his head suddenly.

“Why not,” he suggested, “go back into the Past? At a moment when the
Amulet is unwatched. Wish to be with it, and that it shall be under
your hand.”

It was the simplest thing in the world! And yet none of them had ever
thought of it.

“Come,” cried Rekh-marā, leaping up. “Come _now!_”

“May—may I come?” the learned gentleman timidly asked. “It’s only a
dream, you know.”

“Come, and welcome, oh brother,” Rekh-marā was beginning, but Cyril and
Robert with one voice cried, “_No_.”

“You weren’t with us in Atlantis,” Robert added, “or you’d know better
than to let him come.”

“Dear Jimmy,” said Anthea, “please don’t ask to come. We’ll go and be
back again before you have time to know that we’re gone.”

“And he, too?”

“We must keep together,” said Rekh-marā, “since there is but one
perfect Amulet to which I and these children have equal claims.”

Jane held up the Amulet—Rekh-marā went first—and they all passed
through the great arch into which the Amulet grew at the Name of Power.

The learned gentleman saw through the arch a darkness lighted by smoky
gleams. He rubbed his eyes. And he only rubbed them for ten seconds.

The children and the Priest were in a small, dark chamber. A square
doorway of massive stone let in gleams of shifting light, and the sound
of many voices chanting a slow, strange hymn. They stood listening. Now
and then the chant quickened and the light grew brighter, as though
fuel had been thrown on a fire.

“Where are we?” whispered Anthea.

“And when?” whispered Robert.

“This is some shrine near the beginnings of belief,” said the Egyptian
shivering. “Take the Amulet and come away. It is cold here in the
morning of the world.”

And then Jane felt that her hand was on a slab or table of stone, and,
under her hand, something that felt like the charm that had so long
hung round her neck, only it was thicker. Twice as thick.

“It’s _here!_” she said, “I’ve got it!” And she hardly knew the sound
of her own voice.

“Come away,” repeated Rekh-marā.

“I wish we could see more of this Temple,” said Robert resistingly.

“Come away,” the Priest urged, “there is death all about, and strong
magic. Listen.”

The chanting voices seemed to have grown louder and fiercer, and light
stronger.

“They are coming!” cried Rekh-marā. “Quick, quick, the Amulet!”

Jane held it up.

“What a long time you’ve been rubbing your eyes!” said Anthea; “don’t
you see we’ve got back?” The learned gentleman merely stared at her.

“Miss Anthea—Miss Jane!” It was Nurse’s voice, very much higher and
squeaky and more exalted than usual.

“Oh, bother!” said everyone. Cyril adding, “You just go on with the
dream for a sec, Mr Jimmy, we’ll be back directly. Nurse’ll come up if
we don’t. _She_ wouldn’t think Rekh-marā was a dream.”

Then they went down. Nurse was in the hall, an orange envelope in one
hand, and a pink paper in the other.

“Your Pa and Ma’s come home. ‘Reach London 11.15. Prepare rooms as
directed in letter’, and signed in their two names.”

“Oh, hooray! hooray! hooray!” shouted the boys and Jane. But Anthea
could not shout, she was nearer crying.

“Oh,” she said almost in a whisper, “then it _was_ true. And we _have_
got our hearts’ desire.”

“But I don’t understand about the letter,” Nurse was saying. “I haven’t
_had_ no letter.”

“_Oh!_” said Jane in a queer voice, “I wonder whether it was one of
those... they came that night—you know, when we were playing ‘devil in
the dark’—and I put them in the hat-stand drawer, behind the
clothes-brushes and”—she pulled out the drawer as she spoke—“and here
they are!”

There was a letter for Nurse and one for the children. The letters told
how Father had done being a war-correspondent and was coming home; and
how Mother and The Lamb were going to meet him in Italy and all come
home together; and how The Lamb and Mother were quite well; and how a
telegram would be sent to tell the day and the hour of their
home-coming.

“Mercy me!” said old Nurse. “I declare if it’s not too bad of you, Miss
Jane. I shall have a nice to-do getting things straight for your Pa and
Ma.”

“Oh, never mind, Nurse,” said Jane, hugging her; “isn’t it just too
lovely for anything!”

“We’ll come and help you,” said Cyril. “There’s just something upstairs
we’ve got to settle up, and then we’ll all come and help you.”

“Get along with you,” said old Nurse, but she laughed jollily. “Nice
help _you’d_ be. I know you. And it’s ten o’clock now.”

There was, in fact, something upstairs that they had to settle. Quite a
considerable something, too. And it took much longer than they
expected.

A hasty rush into the boys’ room secured the Psammead, very sandy and
very cross.

“It doesn’t matter how cross and sandy it is though,” said Anthea, “it
ought to be there at the final council.”

“It’ll give the learned gentleman fits, I expect,” said Robert, “when
he sees it.”

But it didn’t.

“The dream is growing more and more wonderful,” he exclaimed, when the
Psammead had been explained to him by Rekh-marā. “I have dreamed this
beast before.”

“Now,” said Robert, “Jane has got the half Amulet and I’ve got the
whole. Show up, Jane.”

Jane untied the string and laid her half Amulet on the table, littered
with dusty papers, and the clay cylinders marked all over with little
marks like the little prints of birds’ little feet.

Robert laid down the whole Amulet, and Anthea gently restrained the
eager hand of the learned gentleman as it reached out yearningly
towards the “perfect specimen”.

And then, just as before on the Marcella quilt, so now on the dusty
litter of papers and curiosities, the half Amulet quivered and shook,
and then, as steel is drawn to a magnet, it was drawn across the dusty
manuscripts, nearer and nearer to the perfect Amulet, warm from the
pocket of Robert. And then, as one drop of water mingles with another
when the panes of the window are wrinkled with rain, as one bead of
mercury is drawn into another bead, the half Amulet, that was the
children’s and was also Rekh-marā’s,—slipped into the whole Amulet,
and, behold! there was only one—the perfect and ultimate Charm.

“And _that’s_ all right,” said the Psammead, breaking a breathless
silence.

“Yes,” said Anthea, “and we’ve got our hearts’ desire. Father and
Mother and The Lamb are coming home today.”

“But what about me?” said Rekh-marā.

“What _is_ your heart’s desire?” Anthea asked.

“Great and deep learning,” said the Priest, without a moment’s
hesitation. “A learning greater and deeper than that of any man of my
land and my time. But learning too great is useless. If I go back to my
own land and my own age, who will believe my tales of what I have seen
in the future? Let me stay here, be the great knower of all that has
been, in that our time, so living to me, so old to you, about which
your learned men speculate unceasingly, and often, _he_ tells me,
vainly.”

“If I were you,” said the Psammead, “I should ask the Amulet about
that. It’s a dangerous thing, trying to live in a time that’s not your
own. You can’t breathe an air that’s thousands of centuries ahead of
your lungs without feeling the effects of it, sooner or later. Prepare
the mystic circle and consult the Amulet.”

“Oh, _what_ a dream!” cried the learned gentleman. “Dear children, if
you love me—and I think you do, in dreams and out of them—prepare the
mystic circle and consult the Amulet!”

They did. As once before, when the sun had shone in August splendour,
they crouched in a circle on the floor. Now the air outside was thick
and yellow with the fog that by some strange decree always attends the
Cattle Show week. And in the street costers were shouting. “Ur Hekau
Setcheh,” Jane said the Name of Power. And instantly the light went
out, and all the sounds went out too, so that there was a silence and a
darkness, both deeper than any darkness or silence that you have ever
even dreamed of imagining. It was like being deaf or blind, only darker
and quieter even than that.

Then out of that vast darkness and silence came a light and a voice.
The light was too faint to see anything by, and the voice was too small
for you to hear what it said. But the light and the voice grew. And the
light was the light that no man may look on and live, and the voice was
the sweetest and most terrible voice in the world. The children cast
down their eyes. And so did everyone.

“I speak,” said the voice. “What is it that you would hear?”

There was a pause. Everyone was afraid to speak.

“What are we to do about Rekh-marā?” said Robert suddenly and abruptly.
“Shall he go back through the Amulet to his own time, or—”

“No one can pass through the Amulet now,” said the beautiful, terrible
voice, “to any land or any time. Only when it was imperfect could such
things be. But men may pass through the perfect charm to the perfect
union, which is not of time or space.”

“Would you be so very kind,” said Anthea tremulously, “as to speak so
that we can understand you? The Psammead said something about Rekh-marā
not being able to live here, and if he can’t get back—” She stopped,
her heart was beating desperately in her throat, as it seemed.

“Nobody can continue to live in a land and in a time not appointed,”
said the voice of glorious sweetness. “But a soul may live, if in that
other time and land there be found a soul so akin to it as to offer it
refuge, in the body of that land and time, that thus they two may be
one soul in one body.”

The children exchanged discouraged glances. But the eyes of Rekh-marā
and the learned gentleman met, and were kind to each other, and
promised each other many things, secret and sacred and very beautiful.

Anthea saw the look.

“Oh, but,” she said, without at all meaning to say it, “dear Jimmy’s
soul isn’t at all like Rekh-marā’s. I’m certain it isn’t. I don’t want
to be rude, but it _isn’t_, you know. Dear Jimmy’s soul is as good as
gold, and—”

“Nothing that is not good can pass beneath the double arch of my
perfect Amulet,” said the voice. “If both are willing, say the word of
Power, and let the two souls become one for ever and ever more.”

“Shall I?” asked Jane.

“Yes.”

“Yes.”

The voices were those of the Egyptian Priest and the learned gentleman,
and the voices were eager, alive, thrilled with hope and the desire of
great things.

So Jane took the Amulet from Robert and held it up between the two men,
and said, for the last time, the word of Power.

“Ur Hekau Setcheh.”

The perfect Amulet grew into a double arch; the two arches leaned to
each other Λ making a great A.

“A stands for Amen,” whispered Jane; “what he was a priest of.”

“Hush!” breathed Anthea.

The great double arch glowed in and through the green light that had
been there since the Name of Power had first been spoken—it glowed with
a light more bright yet more soft than the other light—a glory and
splendour and sweetness unspeakable.

“Come!” cried Rekh-marā, holding out his hands.

“Come!” cried the learned gentleman, and he also held out his hands.

Each moved forward under the glowing, glorious arch of the perfect
Amulet.

Then Rekh-marā quavered and shook, and as steel is drawn to a magnet he
was drawn, under the arch of magic, nearer and nearer to the learned
gentleman. And, as one drop of water mingles with another, when the
window-glass is rain-wrinkled, as one quick-silver bead is drawn to
another quick-silver bead, Rekh-marā, Divine Father of the Temple of
Amen-Rā, was drawn into, slipped into, disappeared into, and was one
with Jimmy, the good, the beloved, the learned gentleman.

And suddenly it was good daylight and the December sun shone. The fog
has passed away like a dream.

The Amulet was there—little and complete in Jane’s hand, and there were
the other children and the Psammead, and the learned gentleman. But
Rekh-marā—or the body of Rekh-marā—was not there any more. As for his
soul...

“Oh, the horrid thing!” cried Robert, and put his foot on a centipede
as long as your finger, that crawled and wriggled and squirmed at the
learned gentleman’s feet.

“_That_,” said the Psammead, “was the evil in the soul of Rekh-marā.”

There was a deep silence.

“Then Rekh-marā’s _him_ now?” said Jane at last.

“All that was good in Rekh-marā,” said the Psammead.

“_He_ ought to have his heart’s desire, too,” said Anthea, in a sort of
stubborn gentleness.

“_His_ heart’s desire,” said the Psammead, “is the perfect Amulet you
hold in your hand. Yes—and has been ever since he first saw the broken
half of it.”

“We’ve got ours,” said Anthea softly.

“Yes,” said the Psammead—its voice was crosser than they had ever heard
it—“your parents are coming home. And what’s to become of _me?_ I shall
be found out, and made a show of, and degraded in every possible way. I
_know_ they’ll make me go into Parliament—hateful place—all mud and no
sand. That beautiful Baalbec temple in the desert! Plenty of good sand
there, and no politics! I wish I were there, safe in the Past—that I
do.”

“I wish you were,” said the learned gentleman absently, yet polite as
ever.

The Psammead swelled itself up, turned its long snail’s eyes in one
last lingering look at Anthea—a loving look, she always said, and
thought—and—vanished.

“Well,” said Anthea, after a silence, “I suppose it’s happy. The only
thing it ever did really care for was _sand_.”

“My dear children,” said the learned gentleman, “I must have fallen
asleep. I’ve had the most extraordinary dream.”

“I hope it was a nice one,” said Cyril with courtesy.

“Yes.... I feel a new man after it. Absolutely a new man.”

There was a ring at the front-door bell. The opening of a door. Voices.

“It’s _them!_” cried Robert, and a thrill ran through four hearts.

“Here!” cried Anthea, snatching the Amulet from Jane and pressing it
into the hand of the learned gentleman. “Here—it’s _yours_—your very
own—a present from us, because you’re Rekh-marā as well as... I mean,
because you’re such a dear.”

She hugged him briefly but fervently, and the four swept down the
stairs to the hall, where a cabman was bringing in boxes, and where,
heavily disguised in travelling cloaks and wraps, was their hearts’
desire—three-fold—Mother, Father, and The Lamb.

“Bless me!” said the learned gentleman, left alone, “bless me! What a
treasure! The dear children! It must be their affection that has given
me these luminous _aperçus_. I seem to see so many things now—things I
never saw before! The dear children! The dear, dear children!”
